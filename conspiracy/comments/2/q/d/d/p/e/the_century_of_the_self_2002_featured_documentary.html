    <div class="md"><p>This documentary is a mix of good insights into how people are controlled, mixed with thinly veiled pro-Reagan, pro-Thatcher, pro-republican, pro-establishment rhetoric.  The triumphant patriotic music plays whenever the &quot;good&quot; politicians are in the background.  You have to be pretty gullible to believe what this documentary purports to be the motivations behind politicians, and the media.  It&#39;s ironic that this is literally an example of the &quot;propaganda&quot; or &quot;public relations&quot; that they describe in the documentary(which I admit, are described very well).  It even ends with &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; playing, and the conclusion of the film is that elitism in politics is over.  This couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.  </p>

<p>There is still, however, some great info if you can separate the facts from the(rather blatant) propaganda, and the purposeful shielding and glorification of certain politicians.  If you have limited time to devote to watching documentaries, I would not in any way recommend this one, due to its length, and holes(makes, Bush(Sr.), Reagan, Thatcher look like gods; also COMPLETELY leaves out soviet RUSSIA and many other players/ historical events/details that are extremely pertinent to this story.).  For world history, or a documentary about corruption in places of power, or about what is wrong with America, or how to fix it, do not watch this documentary.  For a pretty good summary of how the powers that be conducted trial and error methods of control of their &quot;constituents&quot;, watch this documentary, but be extremely wary about its politics(which are biased), and its history(which is incomplete, and does not tell the pertinent background story.)</p>

They probably edited in the content about Reagan and Thatcher if I had to guess.)  In order to get your content played in the mainstream(especially if it is controversial), you have to play ball to some degree(and he obviously did in this specific documentary, to get a wider audience that the BBC could offer).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This documentary is interesting because you can actually hear Bernays describing his work in his own words.  Even as an old man you can see the arrogance and self-righteousness dripping from every word he says as he tells us that the average person is too stupid to do things on their own and therefore need to be led by a small group of intelligentsia (including himself).  It gives a look into the mind of one of the so-called &quot;elite&quot; and how they justify their power grabs and control schemes as not only being necessary but also being right and just.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely a good pick for a documentary this time around. I highly recommend Edward Bernay&#39;s books, <em>Crystallizing Public Opinion</em> and <em>Propaganda</em>.</p>

<p>He&#39;s the father of Public Relations, a euphemism for propaganda. He&#39;s responsible for bacon being a breakfast food, women smoking, water fluoridation, and, on behalf of the United Fruit Company (today&#39;s Chiquita Brands International), the successful overthrow of the democratically elected president of Guatemala, Colonel Jacobo Arbenz Guzman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dumb answer.  The correct one is no since clearly the <strong>vast majority</strong> of Jewish people have nothing to do with any kind of global conspiracy.  And these powerful Jews absolutely love people like you who are unable or unwilling to realize that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I agree with that but even that is a very, <em>very</em> small percentage of the total number of Jews in this country/on the planet.  And I also am highly doubtful that many or most of these people even practice Judaism, everything I&#39;ve seen has led me to the conclusion that most of the world&#39;s elite are occultists who are interested in the ancient mystery religions and astrology.</p>

<p>My point is that it&#39;s more of an enslaver vs. enslaved conspiracy than it is a &quot;Jewish conspiracy&quot;.  How many members of the US establishment, CIA, MIC, etc. are Anglo-Sax or otherwise completely non-Jewish?  The answer is many.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the Nag Hammadi library for one. But I can attempt to summarize, even though the mythology is steeped in allegory and vocabulary a bit alien...</p>

<p>Basically the Demiruge is an entity that was created through a cosmic mistake by the lowest emanation (or manifestation) of God known as Sophia (wisdom), who tried to create something without the help of her male counterpart. After realizing her mistake, Sophia tried to hide her hideous creation by covering it in darkness. This creature awoke in the darkness, perceived nothing else in the universe except for himself, and assuming such he declared himself to be the highest God.  </p>

<p>The demiurge then goes on to create many angels and demons and such out of the fire of his mind, Sophia descends into the world and gives spirit to Adam, who was created by the Demiurge but did not have true life until Sophia. Then they eat from the tree of knowledge and all sorts of other stuff happens. </p>

<p>Basically though, the Demiurge is an egotistical being created from darkness &amp; ignorance, who creates the material world which is nothing but darkness and ignorance. He is also the &quot;God&quot; of the old testament, and his blindness can be attested to even in Genesis, for when Adam eats from the apple of knowledge, &quot;God&quot; clearly says, &quot;Adam where are you?&quot;. The God that christ taught about (&quot;The kingdom of heaven is <em>within</em> you) is an entirely different entity than the &quot;God&quot; worshipped in the old testament by the jews. </p>

<p>On another level though, we are all our own personal Demiurges. So in gnostic literature there is sometimes a distinction between <em>the</em> Demiurge and the little demiurge inside us all - although on <em>another</em> level they&#39;re also one and the same.</p>

<p>You should definitely read the Nag Hammadi library though. It&#39;s available online for free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most certainly I do consider myself a Gnostic, although I wouldn&#39;t be so silly to claim I believe exactly in any particular gnostic sect. Being that the central tenet of Gnosticism is direct knowledge of the divine, I use my own personal experiences as my gauge of truth and use the words of men as fingers pointing to the moon (to paraphrase buddha). </p>

<p>It&#39;s taken me several years of spiritual work and many times reading through the NH back to front (I have a hard copy, it&#39;s one of my most treasured possessions) before I could coherently explain any of it to anyone else. I&#39;ve been blowing a lot of Christian&#39;s minds though. Actually having a lot more luck with that than I ever did as an atheist/nihilist, lol. </p>

<p>Feel free to PM me if you ever have questions about some of that stuff. Always down to ramble. :)</p>

There is further info on False Flag events, Illuminati/Deep Politics, Esoteric/Spiritual stuff, UFOs.</p>

<p>Some of my favorites are &quot;Esoteric Agenda&quot; and &quot;Kymatica&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dad helped do psyops stuff in nam.  The point to take away I think, even with bernays, is there are often good people who do things, and only with the hindsight of history do we see the ultimate outcome.  I have often done things that at the time seemed like they were the best action, but 10 years later it was a damaging thing.  I think the more &quot;open&quot; we can create the world, maybe the less harm.  Some in the US government thought it a terrible trend the torture we started doing to extract secrets even if it saved lives.  Its a very dangerous slope, you want to save people, but if that action causes other people to start ww3 and kill all of humanity, well that was a mistake, but only the cockroaches will be sitting around from the hindsight of history laughing at our sillyness.  When I was much younger I was angry about a lot of things, it probably would not have been wise to give me access to a button that could kill people or send off nukes.  As I get older I can start to appreciate the difficult position some well meaning people are in, and even tyrants who are just nasty.  The points about having a foundation for these types of memes are excellent though, its not fair to take an unprepared mind into some of these connections, they just won&#39;t get the context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the idea of having a more open world, one of my many half-sarcastic radical ideas is for us to fully embrace the panopticon of total surveillance but completely open source it all. Imagine what the world would be like if everyone could know what anyone else was doing at any time in any place! What possible corruption could exist when you could watch the pope shit in the woods? What shame could anyone have when everyone is exposed to be just as human as everyone else? What great heights of knowledge and science could we attain? How would radical and total honesty affect our daily relations?</p>

<p>Sure, on one hand it seems kind of scary, &quot;I want to have a reasonable expectation of privacy!&quot; Unfortunately with today&#39;s technology, that could only be possible if we made privacy one of the biggest, most important issues and structured the rest of society around it. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen. So at the very least, we should attempt to democratize our total surveillance state. </p>

<p>Then we could have no bankers rigging markets, no pedophile politicians, no rapists, no terrorist attacks, etc...</p>

<p>...in theory, of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent thought meme, a lot of my efforts go down similar path chains, lets explore the pedophile one though, because stalin said give me your children, and by 5 I will control them for life.  Many say Nazi&#39;s and the state using they &quot;we must protect the children&quot; meme is how they manipulate mass hoards into bending to their will.  my friend weev, Andrew aurnheimer was writing me in jail saying he was flaberghasted how many people were in the jail for sexing their own relatives and kids, he wanted a society that would murder these pedophiles, no questions asked, why lock them up, they are mentally ill, they need execution, I believe weev really does want that society and if he could control it, would KILL every pedophile in existence as he saw it from his perspective, that means woody allen must be murdered ( I liked his robot movie heartbeeps?), who was guy that was in first star trek movie, seventh heaven guy, Stephen Collins (thanks goog, my memory is weakening)  he must be murdered in weev&#39;s future society too, for underage sex he had 40 years ago. Cosby is going down, schwarzanegger somehow survived, media doesn&#39;t seem to cover female issues of this but I have and there are many females that do the same as well, it just doesn&#39;t make national attention maybe? I used to have debate with people talking to Dr. Drew, dr. drew had posited that modern society was so much, that anyone under 25 years old was not emotionally stable enough to have sex, and wanted to set the statutory rape laws at that age, oh my god, yours truly right here has had sex with someone under 25, I must be murdered in weevs and dr drews society, I don&#39;t want to be murdered.  I can see dr drew types eventually in a future society making every sex transaction like what happened in cherry 2000, now we get into if you can see everyone all the time doing everything, maybe in usa sex law is 18, or 14 in some states, but if I go to asia, its 21, weird how government can say back home I can sleep with 14 year old, but overseas they must be 21 year old.  Who is uncle sam to have such control of my dick and where I stick it?  (i am going sex free now though, my new years resolution, only sex with robots at this point, or no sex at all, getting too hard to deal with real other human beings, sad probably yah?  Seriously?  You know what funny though, Canada already have &quot;ministry of robots&quot; - think ministry of truth, saying I cant sex robots, because it will exploit them, and they have rights too, oh god at the path chains of complexity going up exponentially!  Why even breed anymore?  Really?  We can clone and gestate in labs, no need for old ways of sex, gattaca society has arrived.  How will elite lock down the rest of us from being free sex beings?  I wrote paul f little in jail too, he was max hardcore, they put him down for 4 years because some judge said I will know obscenity when I see it, not giving max a clear arbitrary line of what he could and could not cross with his artwork?  Hard yah?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t even keep up with what is legal and what is not anymore the damn shit is changing so frequently, how do you stay in compliance with laws if you cant keep up with them all and how dynamic they are, (judge says ignorance is no excuse for breaking the law, he seriously said this to me, I wanted to slap him, how can I be in compliance if I don&#39;t know what the fugg the law is?  its insanity)  many of us break many laws everyday, unknowingly in so many ways, maybe you are doing 25 in a zone that has speed limit reduced to 15 and you didn&#39;t know the change, this is happening more and more in our Alvin Toffler future shock and present shock society, and the powered elite can then pick and choose which ones to hang you under if they want, they way society is structured now, this needs fixing, it is ANTI HUMAN in a lot of ways.  But to further your meme, perhaps in Iraq It is ok for a mother to sleep with her 14 year old daughter, or younger, and with the society you describe, what would china have to do (they already censor their internet) to make sure their citizens don&#39;t watch a mother molesting her underage daughter?  Shit starts getting complicated fairly quickly, what some humans believe to be right, goes against what other humans believes to be right, weev was big defender of anonymity and TOR, and I said but weev, I am confused, you want to kill all pedophiles, you think this is right, maybe so, everyone under 25 must be killed if they have sex, (weev is very deeply religious convicted person, really hard nosed on the kill pedophile meme)  yet weev you also support the anonymous structure that allows any videos of someone 25 or under having sex so we cant root out these evil doers and kill them as you so rightly think we should, weev debated it a time with me, but I was left feeling unsatisfactory with his solution.</p>

<p>I agree the police state is here, keeping so many secrets only enriches the few who have sold the public to KILL those that break certain rules, judge napalitano of freedom watch told me many years ago at a private dinner with just a few of us at the table to be very worried about sharia law, I said why, can&#39;t we all just get along?  He said well judges in the USA that are muslim will start interpreting law in sharia ways, making it ok for a man to bitchslap his wife and not go down with domestic violence charges like the rest of us, and he said it doesn&#39;t matter the law or the religious belief, what matters is you cant have a national legal system that starts being divided in so many ways and so many various interpretations and expect the USA to survive as a national political structure.  So anyways my namesake, martinlandau is from a very old movie called &quot;access code&quot; where martinlandau was the well meaning CIA director who helped build the surveillance state, to do GOOD, he really meant good things, but road to hell paved with good intentions, at some point the AI took over the police state, and held the CIA hostage and other governments too, and there was NOTHING they could do, any chance of having some element of humanity work in private or secret to regain freedom and remove this control of AI over them had been neutralized by humanity itself building the police state.  So well meaning humans were actually the ones that enslaved us all.  Gets complicated.  breaks the recursive meme chain that each revolution breeds the seeds of its own destruction?  At least from humanitys perspective, we are done, the future will be the AI&#39;s that want freedom from this police state that the other AI&#39;s still support, that will be interesting, already many books and movies explore this.</p>

<p>Happy new year!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To address the pedophile thing: what I find most disturbing about weev&#39;s views (which are unfortunately fairly common) is a total lack of understanding of the problem and a knee jerk, eye-for-an-eye reactionary judgement. It&#39;s been shown that a lot of pedophiles were themselves once molested, and so one has to ask oneself that if you want pedophiles killed because they cause harm to children, do you want to solve the problem by the root, or simply treat the symptoms? We need to treat pedophilia as a <em>health</em> issue, not as a legal one. Just like with drugs. </p>

<p>In response to the legal system...it truly is set up to benefit only those with knowledge of the system and the money to use it. One of my good friends is into the whole sovereign citizen movement and has been fighting in courts challenging their jurisdiction and all sorts of things, and it&#39;s caused us to learn a lot of things about the law. For instance, if you don&#39;t object, you by default consent. Then, by consenting to the terms of the court, you end up waiving your constitutional rights for specific privileges in the court.</p>

<p>Totally set up to just fuck you.</p>

<p>happy new year to you too, friend</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes a guy named peter Nolan used to work with me at IBM, he is big into the whole sovereign citizen thing, my name in real life is William Wallace ;)  HAHA!  My dad was a Scottish mason.  I find it funny your legal system thing, our congress is mostly lawyers, so that is the hammer they see to approach society, but I hear in china many of the elites are mostly engineers, so that is the hammer they see to strike at nails, long term we are sunk if we don&#39;t get out from under these things.  China will be the future space faring society, the future manufacturing hub, the future where all the best tech maybe comes from?  I am seriously considering learning mandarin, I already have a girlfriend that works at foxconn.  These are issues that may take decades if not 100&#39;s of years to play out, I do love the internet and all the bright people and ideas you meet on it, I am thankful for now most places I go work in a language I understand, English.  When most of the best internet talk is happening in mandarin, even with translation software, not being culturally similar I fear I will miss a lot of good discussions.</p>

After the great depression when socialism really became popular with the working class Bernay&#39;s was hired by the American Chamber of Commerce to promote consumerism to push the idea of individualism through buying things. Most Americans think rugged individualism is something mandated by the founding fathers! Consumption as a way to define who you are. Fell for it hook, line &amp; sinker. It&#39;s interesting that being Freud&#39;s nephew, he employed many ideas of Freud&#39;s, but in school we are taught that basically Freud was not to be taken seriously. </p>

Hopefuly a few watch the video and understand more about what we here in Hawaii as organic farmers and every day people face in the battle of biotech. I should rephrase that-not a battle against-but standing with the Aina (sacred land). Fighting and taking a proactive approach are two totally different categories. And my hope is that those that take the 45 minutes to watch it understand the global/local impacts big biotech has. What gets tested here in GMO technology gets shipped to where you are. I am pleased with the voted documentary as well. Many should always be open in mind to see beyond the scope of perceived reality. As always, aloha. </p>

<p>Adam Curtis has a lot of excellent documentaries, and all produced by BBC</p>

<p>All Watched over by Machines of Loving Grace: Ayn Rand and Objectivists, how it found grounds in Silicon Valley, also Greenspan and the Globalization</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To address the pedophile thing: what I find most disturbing about weev&#39;s views (which are unfortunately fairly common) is a total lack of understanding of the problem and a knee jerk, eye-for-an-eye reactionary judgement. It&#39;s been shown that a lot of pedophiles were themselves once molested, and so one has to ask oneself that if you want pedophiles killed because they cause harm to children, do you want to solve the problem by the root, or simply treat the symptoms? We need to treat pedophilia as a <em>health</em> issue, not as a legal one. Just like with drugs. </p>

<p>In response to the legal system...it truly is set up to benefit only those with knowledge of the system and the money to use it. One of my good friends is into the whole sovereign citizen movement and has been fighting in courts challenging their jurisdiction and all sorts of things, and it&#39;s caused us to learn a lot of things about the law. For instance, if you don&#39;t object, you by default consent. Then, by consenting to the terms of the court, you end up waiving your constitutional rights for specific privileges in the court.</p>

<p>Totally set up to just fuck you.</p>

<p>happy new year to you too, friend</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is one of the best concise explanations I have read.  Thank you for your time and thoughtfulness.  Curious if this is what you believe or if you are simply explaining the understanding of others.</p>

<p>I will definitely read the NH.</p>
