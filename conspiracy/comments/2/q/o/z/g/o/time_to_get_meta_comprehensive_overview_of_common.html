        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey folks how ya doing.</p>

<p>Okay, so today we&#39;re going to go over tips and tricks to spot Trolling/Shilling, the importance of reviewing post history, and some key rules to remember when engaging with opposing viewpoints of questionable integrity.</p>

<p>First of all, let&#39;s differentiate between Trolling and Shilling. A lot of people will say they are the same thing out of ignorance. That&#39;s not to say that someone who equates the two is stupid, just uninformed as to the real relation between the terms.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s get started.</p>

<p>PART ONE: TROLLS</p>

<p>We&#39;ll kick this off with a definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Troll (informal): make a deliberately offensive or provocative online posting with the aim of upsetting someone or eliciting an angry response from them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trolling is, at its core, a morally bankrupt activity. Regardless of belief in the content of the message, trying to Troll someone is primarily an attempt to elicit a negative response out of someone else. As such, Trolling comes in many forms, and usually commit a fallacy of some kind.</p>

<p>Some Trolls are more subtle than others. On one end of the spectrum is the Low-Effort Troll, trying to get a rise out of someone purely through Personal Attacks, Imitation-Baiting, Excessive use of Sarcasm/Questioning/Italics, etc. These Trolls are easy to spot.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the High-Effort Troll will incorporate sneakiness: Feigned Agreement, Appeal to Authority and Undermining Tactics. A Troll that starts out agreeing with you will be harder to spot, and often will hook their target deeply into discussion before they realize they are being trolled. A lot of High-Effort Trolling tactics involve the ambiguity of emotional load that comes with conversing entirely through the written word: Always remember that words and sentences can have multiple meanings depending on inflection, and if you are in doubt about the sincerity of a comment, always try speaking it out loud a few times with different levels of implied sarcasm in your voice. If it seems like the argument could turn against you easily, be cautious.</p>

<p>So how do you fight a Troll? It&#39;s simple: you don&#39;t. The Troll is there <em>specifically to fight</em>. By engaging him, you ensure his victory. Your argument may be airtight, you might bring all the evidence you need to convince any rational person. The Troll doesn&#39;t care, he&#39;s already made you waste your time and gotten a rise out of you. So remember the cardinal rule of internet discourse: <strong><em>DON&#39;T FEED THE TROLLS.</em></strong></p>

<p>PART TWO: SHILLS</p>

<p>Time for another definition. This one is a little older, and not directly relevant to Shilling on the Internet, but I picked it because it exposes the core deceit at play:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shill (slang): a confidence trickster&#39;s assistant, esp a person who poses as an ordinary customer, gambler, etc, in order to entice others to participate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Shill is the guy on the street, beating the Huckster at Three-Card Monty, waving around a stack of twenties that he just won for everybody to see. If Trolling is a morally bankrupt activity, Shilling is moral corruption. The Shill may know they are in the wrong (and likely do), but does not care as long as they make money. As a result, Shilling is a higher art-form than Trolling. While the Troll can skate by on base insults or sarcasm, the Shill must be a seasoned debater, be able to argue a position well, and must have the resources to debunk or otherwise undermine the position of their opponent. If they are a true Shill, they will be all of these things. After all, they are by definition <em>paid</em> for their services.</p>

<p>The most important distinction between a Shill and a Troll is a matter of targeting. Where you, the debater, is the target for a Troll, the Shill is targeting the <em>audience</em>, i.e. the random person who curiously stumbles into the thread and doesn&#39;t know what to think about the subject at hand. The Shill isn&#39;t paid to enrage the skeptic, he is paid to <em>influence the debate.</em></p>

<p>The effective Shill will have their own method of undermining an argument, but will generally use one of three methods. They are all effective if executed well, and are all psychological in nature.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Professor: This tactic attempts to present the Shill as the rational, intelligent side of the argument. He will seem to take the moral and logical high ground. His verbosity will only be matched by the scalpel-like precision with which he wields it. He will refer you to mainstream news articles proving his point. This is a very effective method, because to the average curious person he will seem legitimately intelligent. Luckily, it&#39;s implementation requires a dedicated and well-read individual to pull off, and is not seen as often as others. <em>Unfortunately</em>, when it does turn up, it is often nearly indistinguishable from a genuine engaged commenter presenting his viewpoint. Because of this, accusing The Professor of Shilling should be a last resort: If you can secure a genuine victory through continued debate, it is much preferred to calling him out.</p></li>
<li><p>The Saboteur: Similar in rhetoric to High-Effort Trolling, but decidedly more sophisticated. The Saboteur will take your side of the argument and blow it so far out of proportion it loses credibility with anybody who isn&#39;t already a part of the debate. A classic example is the &quot;missile plane&quot; theory found fairly frequently in 9/11 skeptic circles, i.e. &quot;the planes were cruise missiles mocked up to look like planes.&quot; This is of course absurd, as the impacts in no way resemble cruise missile explosions. But it is close enough to the &quot;drone flights&quot; theory (in contrast, a much sounder argument) to be linked in the minds of an uninformed reader, and therefore the former theory reduces the credibility of the latter. This is an easier tactic to combat, but requires long-winded responses that thoroughly deconstruct the issue at hand.</p></li>
<li><p>The Incredulous Bystander: This method of Shilling is the most common of the three. The Shill comes into a debate in progress, and commits the Fallacy of Personal Incredulity <em>ad nauseum</em>. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I just can&#39;t accept that [abc] is [xyz]. It&#39;s just impossible, there&#39;s no way.&quot; This will go on and on. No matter what you throw at him, he will come back with the same incredulity. The purpose is simple: make the poster look like their argument is too fantastical for the average person to agree with. Although it&#39;s very easy to defeat The Incredulous Bystander by simple logical arguments, be careful. You have to know when to disengage, or the sheer repetition will make your argument seem desperate. Make a final argument against their disingenuous bafflement early, within three replies if possible. Then disengage completely, even if they come back to try and lead you on some more.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Like I said, there are variations on each of these paradigms, and each Shill&#39;s methods will be different. More intelligent or better-equipped Shills will use dirty tactics (Vote Manipulation, Multiple Account Shilling, etc.). Sometimes the combined effort of a group of Shills or Shill Accounts can simply be too much to combat alone. In these cases, it&#39;s simply best to downvote and disengage. Not every battle can be won.</p>

<p>PART THREE: HOW TO I.D. A TROLL/SHILL ACCOUNT</p>

<p>Thanks to the (fairly) open nature of account creation and tracking on reddit, certain things can be learned about an account from the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/ReturnOfMorelaak/">Account Overview Page.</a> Patterns emerge in every account, regardless of if the account is an active Troll/Shill, or not. It is through the account&#39;s activity and past comments that one can glean insight into the intentions of an individual.</p>

<p>A Regular Poster will look something like the account I linked above, which is mine. Post history and comment content may be concentrated to certain subreddits and ideas at times, but will more likely be varied with little recognizable pattern. This is because the individual behind the account doesn&#39;t have an agenda beyond personal entertainment (or knowledge acquisition) on the site.</p>

<p>Since Trolling is an activity anybody with a chip on their shoulder can do, not every Troll will be a dedicated Troll Account. Sometimes, people Troll without realizing they&#39;re doing it. But there are some hallmarks to look out for: conspicuously high numbers of short, one- or two-sentence responses, a tendency to make every statement a question, abnormal distribution of comments (i.e. the last 50 comments in one thread), and excessive use of casual ridicule when responding to serious comments (&quot;lolwat/get your head checked/wow you&#39;re stupid&quot;, etc). Additionally, another way to identify part-time Trolls and Flamers is to check their comment history for key subreddits. If somebody shows up and says something questionably racist, derogatory or inflammatory, look for subreddits that might be indicative of that account holder&#39;s moral leanings (for example, posts to <a href="/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights</a>, <a href="/r/greatapes">/r/greatapes</a> and <a href="/r/ZOG">/r/ZOG</a> are all good indicators that the poster is racist. <em>Call them out on it!</em>).</p>

<p>A Shill Account will look decidedly different, and might at first glance seem like a normal poster.  But there are a couple of key identifiers that can help you form your opinion on the intentions of the account holder:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Karma Authority and Perceived Age: Shills go through accounts like cigarettes.  Once a Shill account is identified as such, it is nearly useless for anything except vote manipulation.  And reddit&#39;s mods (at least, the good ones) have gotten pretty good at identifying accounts that break site rules.  This is especially true for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and a few related subs.  So Shills are often stuck using extremely young accounts with very little commentary added to the site as a whole.  These accounts have very little authority with the more skeptical member of the audience smart enough to look at the account history.  Seeing zero karma, an age measured in days instead of months, and less than a page of posts doesn&#39;t invoke trust in that account&#39;s opinion.  So Shill accounts will be &quot;aged&quot;:  The account will be created, one post (or a few) will be made, and that post&#39;s karma will be manipulated by the Shill&#39;s other accounts, just enough to get the karma up around 150~200.  The account will then be left untouched for anywhere between 4 months and a year.  Once this period of time is up, the account is brought back to life and the Shill starts posting.  Now, the less-thorough reader will see an account that is 7 months old, has 80 link and 225 comment karma, and looks to be active.  If they scroll to the bottom of the comment history, they would see that it&#39;s a fake set up to look that way, but most people won&#39;t.  <strong>Always check for Perceived Age.</strong>  If the history goes beyond 20 pages of comments, chances are good the account is legit.</p></li>
<li><p>Defense Of The Tyrant: Thanks to the paid nature of their job, the Shill will not advocate reasonable positions.  They are specifically here to lessen the impact of questionable material, undermine the opposition to negative aspects of the Status Quo, and make skeptics and activists look bad.  The most current example is the rampant Shilling for the Police found in nearly every thread that covers Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Ferguson, Police Brutality or related issues.  It is not a popular opinion to defend tyranny, and yet for every post condemning police violence, there is another apologist (or downright authoritarian) comment accusing any protest of undermining the authority of the stewards of public safety.  Some of these are regular (if horribly misguided) posters.  But it is absolutely an indicator of Shilling, and if you see it combined with other indicators, there is a good chance they were paid to skew the conversation further towards confusion, vitriol, animosity and gridlock.  </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Deadly Serious&quot;:  As has been previously stated, the Shill has a specific goal of making their argument look better than another.  In this regard, they will use every tool they have to undermine their opponent.  One logical fallacy is commonly used: Appeal to Emotion, AKA The &quot;Deadly Serious&quot; argument.  When you appeal to emotion, you are attempting to scare the audience into reactive thinking. &quot;Harassing Police is Deadly Serious&quot; is a good example.  You inject the fear of personal safety into the conversation: &quot;What if the cops just quit? Rampant crime! I don&#39;t want to have to fear for myself and my children! I don&#39;t like it, but this guy has a point.&quot;  It&#39;s a fallacy because emotion is irrational.  The reality is there is a problem in this country, and whether or not police will &quot;put up with&quot; protesting is completely unrelated to the actual issue of the creeping authoritarianism plaguing law enforcement throughout America.  Again, anybody can Appeal to Emotion accidentally, but if you see it over and over again in the account history, it&#39;s most likely deliberate abuse of the fallacy.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>PART FOUR: BEST PRACTICES FOR FIGHTING SHILLS</p>

<p>So, you&#39;ve identified a Shill.  You&#39;ve decided not to put up with it.  What do you do?</p>

<p>First of all, <em>keep calm.</em>  Engaging in heated debate makes both sides of the argument seem irrational, to your detriment.  The Shill doesn&#39;t have to look good, he just has to make <em>you</em> look bad, or without that, make the debate so incomprehensibly vitriolic that the audience decides to leave and do something else.  By making your case logically, rationally, and without emotional attachment or useless insults, you will come off as logical, rational, informed, and respectable.</p>

<p>Second: Debate the Topic primarily, not the Opposition.  Attacks on Authority and Integrity are useful <em>only once Authority and Integrity are in doubt.</em>  Until then (or if you are up against The Professor), you are just giving the Shill more ammo to use against you.  Stay on topic, don&#39;t get lost in semantics and nitpicking, state your case simply.  If you do things right, most Shills will give up before you.</p>

<p>Third: Karma is Useless.  Ever since reddit changed the voting scheme there has been absolutely no point to tracking Karma as an indicator of winning a conversation or not.  Brigading is absolutely a problem whether or not the mods acknowledge it, and chances are good your posts will be net negative, even if you are clearly winning your argument.  Don&#39;t let it get to you! It&#39;s an imaginary number that is easily skewed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty close to character limit at this point, so I figure it&#39;s about time to stop this train.  Comments, Questions, anything is welcome.  This is a rough outline of my own experiences with logic and debate in the treacherous semantic waters we swim in, and is by no means complete.  Take these ideas and interpret them, expand on them, make them your own.  Then spread it where you can.  Any commenter can be a strong debater, if they know the pitfalls and traps that are set for them.</p>

<p>Oh, almost forgot.  This post is also an open invitation to any Ex-Shills that want to share their knowledge.</p>

<p>Remember folks, Stay Skeptical.</p>

<p>If you have factual information and present it clearly without malice it wont matter what the shill is saying. Too often we attribute a shill to a person with a different opinion, instead of dismissing that person by yelling shill and being passive aggressive or outright hostile, explain your point to them as if you were trying to show them your point of view. </p>

<p>Dont shutdown other users because they dont see a subject the same way you do. Also, and I know this is difficult... not all of you are correct all of the time. Take new information and incorporate it, its okay to change your beliefs in light of new info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy reading this subreddit, but I find your conclusions and those of nearly everyone here to be horribly biased on factors that do not really factor into an account.</p>

<p>This one for instance. I frequented reddit in its heyday with a different user account, and quite enjoyed it, collected my karma and posted tidbits here and there.</p>

<p>But that was quite literally, years ago. Now I have this shiny new account, which I also quite enjoy browsing reddit on. Do I post a lot? Not by any means. Does that automatically make me as a person less qualified to post material with substance? I&#39;d like to think not.</p>

<p>You limit yourselves greatly by putting stock into post history and account age though. Just look at the myriad of bots, some of which now delightfully simply repost comments in a thread to garner a higher post count, and appear normal. Rather than accept that someone may simply be uneducated on a topic and then attempting to give them said knowledge, you toss them aside based on factors of post count. I&#39;ve seen it in many a thread in this subreddit, and I frankly find it to be childish, and also disturbing(considering the overall subject material of this subreddit). </p>

<p>I honestly see less rationality from the heavily active base of this subreddit, than I do from the bulk of posters who simply come here for the first time. Turned away by the childlike us vs them mentality. You should welcome people of opposing views, nurture what little scepticism they may have, and educate them on ideas that they may either not know exist, or simply haven&#39;t had the proper tools to understand. </p>

<p>I am not saying that there are not deliberate trolls and shills. I am not saying that everyone who is identified as one is innocent. I just wish that the users here were less concerned with post histories, and more concerned with spreading knowledge. I believe strongly that nobody can stop information from spreading, but a damn fine job of that is done when you push people away, and outright refuse to either hear their arguments, or label them based on their post counts.</p>

<p>I apologize for this seemingly pointless rant, but you&#39;re all generally intelligent people, and I really wish you&#39;d act more like adults, and less like a class of fourth graders always afraid of the new student.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your post.  You have misunderstood or are missing my intention here.</p>

<p>As I said elsewhere in the comments, these are not rigorous guidelines for accusation.  They are merely indicators of possibly disingenuous commentary.  Not everyone who posts in these ways will be trolls/shills.  Likewise, not all trolls/shills will be identifiable by these tactics.  Furthermore, to arbitrarily judge any account that fits these identifiers to be a troll/shill would be uncritical and frankly stupid.</p>

<p>To make it clear, I agree with what you&#39;ve said.  But it is not what I  said in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not attempting to belittle you, but the fact that a topic like this is required in the first place just irks me. Everytime I open a topic in this subreddit I find as much disinformation from the people who are replying as I do from the less savory folk.</p>

<p>I realize I worded my opening a bit wrong, as to give that exact impression, and so I apologize. Your topic is well-meaning and by all regards, gives a good critical thinking guide to the identification of what are honestly, mindless spam.</p>

<p>Again, sorry about my poor choice of opening statement, but I do honestly believe that the concerted focus of this community on its own infiltration by spam is as bad as the spam itself. If you feel differently, that&#39;s your right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries friend, everyone is entitled to their opinion.  The issue with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is that it is constantly under some form of attack.  Like it or not, Trolling and Shilling are real problems on reddit, and much of that problem comes home to roost right here.  It is an unfortunate side effect that, in combating the problem, regular users are sometimes misidentified.  <em>That</em> was the purpose of this post: to give a thorough description of common tactics so as to inform those less savvy, and hopefully reduce the number of false accusations that happen on this sub every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was the point I was trying to get at with my question. I was curious if OP had compared his criteria with the post history with anyone who was actually proven to be a shill (either through admission or through some form of actual, real proof). Considering I know very few of these cases I&#39;d be willing to bet OP just listed some broad characteristics that can be applied to anyone who maintains a belief he/she disagrees with. A convenient way to feed the common conspiracy theorist persecution complex while insulating their beliefs from criticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upvoted for many good points and a truly needed post here. This sub lacks such as of recent in the past year. Yet sadly and quite honestly I seem to fall under some of your mentioned definitions. I&#39;m an altruistic curious individual who believes balance is a solution. Not personal judgements and attacks against those with opposing views. But an open willingness to look at things from all angles. I do question and engage with an open mind to explore. Perhaps it was the way I was brought up. But questioning with compassion and a willingness to see others opinions as valid is legit to me. I might not agree. And I might agree. I can see myself as a skeptical altruistic individual. I post many things (90%) related to my POV in many subs. I can see myself viewed as having a personal narrative. An organic heirloom gardener/farmer living in the hotbed of GMo testing, trying to reinstill indigenous cultures and gardening/permaculture practices worldwide, engaged in what&#39;s right in the world, questioning what may be wrong, preparing for what may happen if we as individuals do not unite into paradigm shifting communities, and trying to do it in grace. So let&#39;s flip the script... How do genuine users of reddit with true intentions get our message across without coming off like a &quot;troll or shill&quot;? You state that trolls are surprisingly very community oriented individuals. Well that&#39;s me through and through. Am I a troll because I am community oriented? This is a rediculous assumption and a prejudice IMO. Not all who are community oriented are trolls in the same that not all who are shills are as you have personally defined. Creating and defining community is the true key in sustainability.  I agree with a lot of your post but categorizing individuals into a narrow scope of individuality is simply furthering duality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your comment, and I can understand the worry.</p>

<p>My post is not an attempt at rigorously defining the Troll/Shill, nor is it a set guideline for identifying others as such.  It is merely common tactics and identifiers <em>used</em> by Trolls and Shills, and as such is meant to help the skeptic come to his own decision as to the intentions of his opponent.</p>

<p>As to the community thing... I&#39;d say think of it this way: Trolls are community-oriented people, but not all community-oriented people are Trolls.  And it&#39;s not something you can <em>accuse</em> Trolls of being, because at its core being a community-oriented person is a good thing.  For Trolls, the problem comes in that their community is founded on ridicule and debasement of another segment of society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seemed like the context you used &quot;community oriented&quot; in was describing how trolls have their <em>own</em> communities where they are integrated, and not just that they become integrated with communities they target for ridicule.</p>

<p>I feel like it should also be noted that these trolls also tend to use communities like conspiratard as a &quot;Karma buffer&quot;, so that at first glance, their account seems legitimate with a positive link/comment score. Some people judge accounts not just by history but by Karma as well, for instance, if an account has significantly negative comment karma, depending on their age, it is likely they are a troll. However if the account has a highly positive karma score, it may be harder to tell especially if they are very active with the account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mahalo for the reply. Not worried honestly as reddit is an illusionary reality. I am who I am. Concerned more with such a narrow scope in definition- as being a better term than worried. I see your POV with community of trolling, but your statement makes me think of categorizing all as one, and not many as individuals. Or vise versa, all as individuals and not as one. I&#39;m sure you see where I am going here. My mind thinks this way in an attempted balance. And yet a willingness to question. I probably do come off as opposition because I think inside out of the box. And like a Cheshire cat of sorts. I&#39;ll leave our conversation at this as I don&#39;t want to distract from others. But please do remember compassionate skepticism when viewing others posting history, karma and the like here. Always good to look deeper and understand that not everyone is a troll/shill. Although many are who post here. </p>

<p>You did slip one in there, suggesting an assumption-based conclusion using Strawmen: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A classic example is the &quot;missile plane&quot; theory found fairly frequently in 9/11 skeptic circles, i.e. &quot;the planes were cruise missiles mocked up to look like planes.&quot; This is of course absurd, as the <em>impacts</em> in no way resemble cruise missile <em>explosions</em>.

    <div class="md"><p>A quick note on <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, and another example of the difference between Trolls and Shills.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is not a Shill board.  They are a Troll Brigade.  A true Paid Shill wouldn&#39;t be caught dead posting there, unless he was deliberately trying to ruin the credibility of an account for some purpose.  It&#39;s mods may be Shills, and its initial impetus might have been the work of Shills, but a <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> shitposter more closely resembles a <a href="/r/TumblrInAction">/r/TumblrInAction</a> poster than a Shill.</p>

<p>The reason I make this distinction is because Trolls are--surprisingly--very community-oriented individuals.  They like to show off their victories to each other, and congratulate themselves and one another when they manage to fish out a big fight.  To borrow an ancient phrase from a long-lived corner of the Internet, they are &quot;in it for the lulz&quot;, and spreading the mirth around is part of that.  So when you find a <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> Troll, remember that you&#39;re not fighting a real opponent, you&#39;re just engaging a Troll (which never ends well).  Ignore them (even when they&#39;re brigading us) and they&#39;ll eventually go away.  Remember: Karma is useless anyway.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are sure you are fighting a Shill, <strong><em>don&#39;t mention <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, ever.</em></strong>  The board is founded on negativity and ridicule, and accusing a Shill of connection to it is basically handing them the victim card they will use against you.  On top of that, you&#39;ve invited every Troll in sight to come join the conversation, which is almost guaranteed to turn out bad for you.</p>

<p>I freely admit to refreshing my user ID regularly, because I refuse to take part in the circle-jerk which runs here concerning certain topics, and far too many regulars in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> treat the downvote button as &quot;disagree&quot;.

<p>So you feel you have a position of papal infallibility on deciding what constitutes a &quot;reasonable position&quot;? And disagreeing with you there is &quot;an indicator of Shilling&quot;? Sadly, this is something we see a lot here.

<p>At no point did I say it was a good idea to use your opponent&#39;s account history as a rhetorical cudgel to attack his credibility.  That would be a fallacy (<em>ad hominem</em>, as you say).  What I <em>did</em> say was post history can be useful when determining whether or not your opponent&#39;s motivation is genuine or not.</p>

<p>And good on you for using fresh accounts, if you feel you need to.  And considering your tendency to bait and mock posters in Sandy Hook threads, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/burningempires">which makes up 90% of your one-month post history</a>, I&#39;m not surprised you feel the need...</p>

<p>Oh, and thanks for chopping my comment up into tiny pieces that fit your narrative.  Let&#39;s read the whole thing again, shall we?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defense Of The Tyrant: Thanks to the paid nature of their job, the Shill will not advocate reasonable positions. They are specifically here to lessen the impact of questionable material, undermine the opposition to negative aspects of the Status Quo, and make skeptics and activists look bad. The most current example is the rampant Shilling for the Police found in nearly every thread that covers Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Ferguson, Police Brutality or related issues. It is not a popular opinion to defend tyranny, and yet for every post condemning police violence, there is another apologist (or downright authoritarian) comment accusing any protest of undermining the authority of the stewards of public safety. <strong><em>Some of these are regular (if horribly misguided) posters.</em></strong> But it is absolutely an indicator of Shilling, and <strong><em>if you see it combined with other indicators</em></strong>, there is a good chance they were paid to skew the conversation further towards confusion, vitriol, animosity and gridlock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So! When you read the whole thing, your ridiculous claim that I believe my opinion to be infallible vanishes in a puff of smoke.  So does your accusation that I equate disagreement with Shilling.  But you know what <em>does</em> stick around, once you&#39;ve lost your bite?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reality is, most people are in favor of, and support, law and order, and will tend to respect its keepers and those who put their lives on the line to defend society, be they soldiers, policemen, etc.</p>

<p>Who decides what counts &quot;reasonable&quot;? You still refuse to specify this. But apparently, judging by the rest of the paragraph, refusing to engagie in the anti-police <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> circlejerk is unreasonable.</p>

<p>It seems you&#39;re just another one of the members who see &quot;shills&quot; lurking behind many contrary opinions. The bottom line actually is, the kind of thinking commonly seen here is vastly different to what the general beliefs of the population think. Doesn&#39;t make it wrong, of course. But it does mean most people will naturally disagree, and there&#39;s absolutely no need to fabricate boogeyman &quot;shills&quot; to explain this. </p>

<p>Doing so in posts like this simply re-enforces the negative stereotype of the paranoid conspiracy researcher who thinks &quot;they&quot; are out to get them.</p>

<p>Ah, but see, this is a <em>metapost</em>, and the topic at hand is account histories and their usefulness in identifying Shills.  So, while <em>most</em> discussions will by necessity steer towards actual debate topics and away from Attacks on Integrity, here your post history is fair game!</p>

<p>Statements that I have <em>already addressed</em> in the comment that <em>you just replied to.</em>  If you&#39;re going to rehash defeated arguments, <em>at the very least</em> change what line you&#39;re quoting, or how you&#39;re quoting it.</p>

<p>Still refuse to specify??? <em>You never asked me to specify.</em> You don&#39;t get to berate me for refusing to do something I was never asked to do.  You&#39;re getting ahead of yourself.  Be careful, you might <em>slip</em>.</p>

<p>So, to answer your extremely rude method of asking me to specify what is a &quot;reasonable position,&quot; I would say one that is: 1. Not so outlandish as to be completely unbelievable, 2. has its roots in basic human decency, freedom of speech and respect for others, 3. does not commit to reinforcing the subjugation of another individual or group of individuals, and 4. does not commit any blatant logical fallacies.</p>

<p>So to take the current case into consideration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>First off, you misrepresent the position.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not anti-police, it is <em>anti-authoritarian.</em>  It just so happens that the main culprit for authoritarianism in America today is the police.  It is unfortunate that more posters around here don&#39;t make the distinction, but that&#39;s what separates true skeptics from the wingnuts.  And in the meantime, you&#39;ve pinned the failings of the least of us on the opinions of the best of us.  <em>Nice.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems you&#39;re just another one of the members who see &quot;shills&quot; lurking behind many contrary opinions. The bottom line actually is, the kind of thinking commonly seen here is vastly different to what the general beliefs of the population think. Doesn&#39;t make it wrong, of course. But it does mean most people will naturally disagree, and there&#39;s absolutely no need to fabricate boogeyman &quot;shills&quot; to explain this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The general beliefs of the population are guided by news media outlets funded by advertising dollars spent by corporations that own stock in the parent companies that own the channels the population gets their beliefs from.  If you could follow that, you&#39;d see that I don&#39;t put much faith in anything you could define as a &quot;general belief.&quot;  You don&#39;t get brilliant insight from someone who believes what they see on Fox news or MSNBC, you get talking points and misdirected rage.  But you&#39;re right, there <em>isn&#39;t</em> a need to fabricate shills, when the news agencies <em>are</em> paid interests that manipulate public opinion for profit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doing so in posts like this simply re-enforces the negative stereotype of the paranoid conspiracy researcher who thinks &quot;they&quot; are out to get them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Yet again</em>, you completely misunderstand the content of my post.  <em>The post is not a warning</em>, it is a teaching moment.  Being able to recognize disingenuous posters and distinguish between them and normal redditors is imperative to this community.  Or are you going to say <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> doesn&#39;t exist and brigading is a myth next?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to get sly with me, buddy.  I&#39;ll dance circles around you all day.</p>

<p>The vocal support for Putin, and pro-Russian stance commonly seen and upvoted here, would suggest otherwise. </p>

<p>However, if you see something in a Youtube video or InfoWars, then it should be believed and <strong>is</strong> &quot;brilliant insight&quot;? Apart from the above sounding very patronising, Do you think conspiracy outlets <em>don&#39;t</em> have an agenda, and do not seek to manipulate the opnions of those who read them, every bit as much? </p>

<p>My main problem with much of this sub is that they preach critical thinking, but don&#39;t practice it. &quot;Question everything,&quot; is a fine philosophy, but it needs to be applied to all sources and beliefs, not just mainstream ones. </p>

<p>I heartily support and endorse the idea of this post as a &quot;teaching moment&quot;: critical thinking skills are a fabulous tool for cutting through bullshit, regardless of source. But I found it couched too much in an &quot;us vs. them&quot; paradigm, when in reality, posters and commenters here operate on a much more subtle spectrum of views, and I think, deserve to be treated as such. </p>

<blockquote>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> exists - and frankly, there are times when I feel this sub deserves it, such as stickying a documentary of Nazi apologist nonsense which belongs in <a href="/r/whitepower">/r/whitepower</a> [edit: which also disproves the alleged &quot;anti-authoritarian&quot; stance; you don&#39;t get much more authoritarian than the Third Reich!]. And brigading exists - but in both directions. People frequently downvote comments here that are 100% factual information, because it doesn&#39;t fit their preconceived beliefs. Of course, this happens across all of Reddit - but then, most subs do not see themselves as some kind of &quot;truth seekers.&quot;</p>

<p>This is actually getting interesting now. I genuinely appreciate your responses. </p>

<p>When Russian political dealings get play on this sub, the vocal support I see is mostly shitposting.  Yes, there are some critically written supporters of Putin&#39;s clout, but that support is more often aggrandizement for his willingness to berate the United States for its atrocious behavior in the international community.  And more to the point, I have <em>never</em> seen a post praising Russia for its police force or it&#39;s military overreach that wasn&#39;t a shitpost and down voted into oblivion.</p>

<p>Stop putting words in my mouth.  The point of my statement is not to belittle mainstream media consumers, it is to point out that <em>they don&#39;t think critically.</em>. They blindly accept what they see every time they turn on one channel, froth and rage at the <em>other</em> channel, and never stop to think there might be more than two sides to any issue.  So no, you <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> believe whatever you see on InfoWars.  Alex Jones has his agenda too.  But you absolutely <em>should</em> take the time to understand every side of an issue as you form your opinion on it, and not just dismiss an argument because of its source.  And to deflect your next accusation, <em>that includes taking mainstream media into account.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>See, we&#39;re saying the same damn thing.  But you&#39;re the one writing off the sources and beliefs of this whole sub when you say things like:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Or when you condemn the the whole population of the sub to bigotry for <em>watching a movie:</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>My patience is wearing thin here.  Either bring a substantial argument that doesn&#39;t contradict itself or attack me or the subreddit personally, or I&#39;m moving on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m completely with you there. But, sadly, the above mindset is something that&#39;s all too commonly found in this subreddit as well. A lot of what I see here has an unquestioning acceptance that is little or no better than the &quot;sheeple&quot;. [Also, note: &quot;much&quot; does not equal &quot;all&quot;, as you allege] It&#39;s just acceptance of a different source, which is no improvement at all.</p>

<p>My problem with the Nazi doc was not that it was posted here (total BS though it was, there has been worse). It&#39;s that it was stickied and sidebarred by the mods, effectively giving it official endorsement, without any effort to present another side. Really, this and the hundreds of upvotes the piece of Nazi propaganda received couldn&#39;t hand <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> a better stick with which to whack this subreddit or conspiracy researchers. </p>

<p>I&#39;m perfectly happy to close things out as well. My bottom line is, I found your post based on a &quot;trench mentality.&quot; No matter how wrong-headed I may feel they are, I&#39;ve never assumed anyone is arguing in bad faith. I think that&#39;s generally a much better way to proceed than labeling some people, on dubious grounds, as &quot;shills&quot; and &quot;trolls&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mahalo for the reply. Not worried honestly as reddit is an illusionary reality. I am who I am. Concerned more with such a narrow scope in definition- as being a better term than worried. I see your POV with community of trolling, but your statement makes me think of categorizing all as one, and not many as individuals. Or vise versa, all as individuals and not as one. I&#39;m sure you see where I am going here. My mind thinks this way in an attempted balance. And yet a willingness to question. I probably do come off as opposition because I think inside out of the box. And like a Cheshire cat of sorts. I&#39;ll leave our conversation at this as I don&#39;t want to distract from others. But please do remember compassionate skepticism when viewing others posting history, karma and the like here. Always good to look deeper and understand that not everyone is a troll/shill. Although many are who post here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seemed like the context you used &quot;community oriented&quot; in was describing how trolls have their <em>own</em> communities where they are integrated, and not just that they become integrated with communities they target for ridicule.</p>

<p>I feel like it should also be noted that these trolls also tend to use communities like conspiratard as a &quot;Karma buffer&quot;, so that at first glance, their account seems legitimate with a positive link/comment score. Some people judge accounts not just by history but by Karma as well, for instance, if an account has significantly negative comment karma, depending on their age, it is likely they are a troll. However if the account has a highly positive karma score, it may be harder to tell especially if they are very active with the account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries friend, everyone is entitled to their opinion.  The issue with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is that it is constantly under some form of attack.  Like it or not, Trolling and Shilling are real problems on reddit, and much of that problem comes home to roost right here.  It is an unfortunate side effect that, in combating the problem, regular users are sometimes misidentified.  <em>That</em> was the purpose of this post: to give a thorough description of common tactics so as to inform those less savvy, and hopefully reduce the number of false accusations that happen on this sub every day.</p>
