       Before Christmas I posted that Americans would be provided a few "no-spray" days over Christmas. The post seems to have been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Citizens traveled around the country and enjoyed the company of family, without trails overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regular spraying will resume this weekend. Simply look up and observe the white trails criss-crossing the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see them, ask yourself why I was right about them not being around the past few days. Even if they're just harmless contrails. Obviously planes were flying around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then ask yourself why they are returning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't yet seen photographic evidence of trails in the US from the past few days (12/24 - 12/26). If you have any, post them here. Interestingly, we've seen them in other countries.

       I'm curious as to why chemtrail believers think that the spraying is occurring as well. I believe spraying happens but I am not certain why. The most realistic answer that I have heard is that it's to reflect sunlight back to lessen the impact of global warming.

       That is the honeypot. The real reason is that it's poisoning humans and deterring their ability to provide food for themselves.

       I have driven from coast to coast in the last few days and the last that I saw were on the 22nd (IIRC)??
      </p>
      <p>
       I even mentioned it to my wife yesterday just before dusk near Chicago. She thinks that they're simply spraying at night since we DID see one starting JUST as the sun went down yesterday--almost above the cirrus which would put that airplane VERY high. Most Chemtrails are spread super-cirrus lately.

       SOURCE: Business and commuter-jet pilot 12 years, first officer 3 years, have my own Socata turboprop. I know the difference between contrails and the SHIT they've been spreading...both literally and figuratively.

       I noticed a contrail today.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the past week, almost two weeks, it's been overcast where I live. Depressing but "at least it's not the snow we normally have". Beginning yesterday the clouds cleared and today I noticed a contrail.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say contrail because it disappeared in short time rather than dispersing and becoming a cloudy haze throughout the sky.

       Tomorrow I'll be looking.

       Academic. Not trying to convince anyone, but attempting to provide constrictions on trail patterns. The trails themselves should be able to be predicted if they are dependent on weather conditions and physical phenomena. Our research is focused on American trails, but data outside the US is also helpful.

       The contrails form then dissipate 20-30 wingspans behind the engines...assuming that we're talking about turbojets here.

       The CHEMtrails do NOT dissipate; they hang around in "strings" then spread out...eventually covering and blocking out the entire sky.

       No, they don't. I live in Arizona. There are no cold wet fronts. It's a hot dry desert, and I see them often, but luckily I have found the pattern of when they appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the future, you will wonder why I can predict them. Either I'm right and it's an agenda of spraying persistent stratospheric aerosols on to human populations, or just some crazy coincidence and I just happened to be right over and over.

       If anyone is spraying stratospheric aerosols you won't be able to see them because they will be too high. The lower limit of the stratosphere is about 60,000 feet where you are. Airliners can only fly up to about 42,000 feet, where they will stall due to the thin air. Stratospheric Aerosol Dispersal is slated to take place at 80,000 feet and the contrails you see are at 23 to 40,000 feet. Clearly there is no connection and what you are looking at is simply contrails, not SAD.

       It's not just semantics though, is it? Your whole case collapses when you start trying to prove chemtrails exist by conflating contrails with some form of geoengineering.

       You aggressively patrol every chemtrail related post here to try to convince people that they have never seen any evidence of a spraying operation, yet you should only claim that you do not know if there is a secret spraying operation going on or not. You are always showing up, trying to convince people that there are no secret spraying operations happening, yet you miss this obvious fact: you
       <strong>
        <em>
         don't

       know. If you're doing this on Reddit and Facebook as well, I think you need a new hobby.

       I frequently write about the REAL spraying operations which are most probably going on. Except that they are happening in the Stratosphere where we can't see them and they are kept secret. That's my only agenda here.... to tell people that contrails are not part of any geoengineering project and to stop wasting time telling people to "Look Up" at them. If you want to campaign against the very real dangers of geoengineering then first you need to find out what geoengineering actually is, and what it is not. And it is NOT about making 100-mile long trails of white stuff in the troposphere.

       So there are one or more spraying programs occurring, but they are invisible and therefore nobody has ever presented any real evidence of them. OK, thanks for clearing that up.

       I believe that Stratospheric Aerosol Dispersal is arrogant madness. If you understand anything about chaos theory you'll realise that messing with the weather could open a can of worms that we'll never shut again.
      </p>
      <p>
       SAD is only being experimented on at present; there's a global ban on widespread weather modification but 'experiments' and small scale cloud busting are allowed. So you can be sure the Dr Strangelove characters are experimenting the hell out of it right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some geoengineering schemes may actually work and help to cool the planet. But the trouble is that we'll not know if it's successful without trying it, and by then it'll be too late to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       My concern is that well-meaning but deluded scientists start experiments on opposite sides of the world which react to each other and unleash the apocalypse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to stop discussion of geoengineering - exactly the opposite. I'm trying to stop people wasting their time and energy tilting at windmills like some modern day Don Quixote.

       Contrails simply disappear behind the plane going overhead. Chemtrails remain, and stretch from horizon to horizon. It's very sad that you see so many.

       Where do you keep getting this ridiculous notion? They've existed in

       . This whole idea of "chemtrails dissipate slower" is complete and utter bunk. The attributes of contrails are entirely dependent on factors such as humidity and temperature and they can range from spreading clouds to pencil-thin lines that evaporate immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, do some research and actually think a bit before you keep trying to spread this nonsense.

       You weren't alive several decades ago and didn't observe what people my age did. There were no trails back then. Now there are. There are many in my profession that are alarmed, and we watch younger people like yourself glued to your smartphones and playing video games instead of demanding answers.

       So? That doesn't mean there was a lack of video footage or picture evidence that you're simply wrong. On top of that, both my father and grandfather are pilots (and my grandfather was an engineer at Honeywell), and both think chemtrails are a load of crock. There simply isn't any evidence for it, and plenty that completely disagrees with your assertion that this is an exclusively modern phenomena.

       That's just the tired old mantra which chemtrailers use in every argument. Contrails sometimes dissipate slowly, and some times quickly. The difference is the amount of moisture in the air. If the air is wet then the contrail will not only stick around, but it will get much bigger as more water vapour freezes onto the ice crystals.
