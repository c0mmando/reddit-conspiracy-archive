<p>Point is, if it&#39;s an honest post about something someone learned that day then it should stand. </p>

<p>The only exceptions I can see are non genuine posts where it&#39;s just someone trying to have YOU learn something today that they already knew, essentially trying to instigate a discussion, debate, or ideas; or if it&#39;s something truly innappropriate like &quot;TIL, how to enter my nearest child porn ring, here&#39;s your link!&quot;</p>

<p>A good number of legitimate posts with information some may deem subversive, contrary to their beliefs, or that they feel give power or ground to those they disagree with do seem to disappear around here. </p>

<p>Of course, it IS politics. It&#39;s about making sure some ideas are kept within a &quot;safe&quot; little bubble. But I find your acceptance and non-chalant brushing aside to be a little... Sheepish. </p>

<p>The only exceptions I can see are non genuine posts where it&#39;s just someone trying to have YOU learn something today that they already knew, essentially trying to instigate a discussion, debate, or ideas</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it would appear we actually agree, although you lump me in to the group you feel aggrieved by, as my original statement still stands and the topic of your reply seems to have been already pretty clearly addressed therein. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want reddit turned into a soapbox for whatever hum drum cause some hopped up douche who just read 1984 for the first time decides is vital to get out to the public. </p>

<p>But none the less, a valid TIL that just happens to have a political lean that bothers you, is still a valid TIL. At least it should be. </p>

<p>But again...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Beyond that, reddit is a pretty good barometer of what people want to read or learn about. </p>

<p>Let the people sort it out. If they don&#39;t like a specific TIL full of cocklery and manifesto&#39;s, it won&#39;t get upvoted. Pretty simple really. </p>

<p>But alas. <em>Sigh</em>. I&#39;m on THE.FUCKING.INTERNET.</p>

<p>What am I thinking imagining there is such a possibility. </p>

<p>By relegating facts as &quot;opinions&quot; people permit themselves to ignore them. They do this because they lack the intellectual integrity and honesty needed to critically analyze divergent information.</p>

<p>Then they think their more comfortable baseless fictional narrative is just as valid an &quot;opinion&quot; as the one independently supported by the facts.</p>

<p>My issues with your grammar:</p>

<p>You mean delegating not relegating.</p>

<p>Intellectual integrity and honesty is super redundant.</p>

<p>Divergent information gets a pass just barely. Opposing viewpoints makes more sense here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you often belittle others? It&#39;s pretty devolving.</p>

<p>&quot;consign or dismiss to an inferior rank or position.&quot; is relegate. Delegate is &quot;reassign a task&quot;. I said &quot;dismiss facts to an inferior rank or position as opinions&quot;. Delegate used here would be a meaningless word salad of &quot;reassigning a task of facts&quot;.</p>

<p>Integrity is about action and honesty is about interpretation. You can engage with things you disagree with (integrity) and maintain an untruthful stance (honesty). You can also maintain a stance you believe to be true (honesty) and refuse to explore other perspectives (integrity).  </p>

<p>Divergent is about systemic assumptions due to preconceived models. Opposing implicates a perspective on an equivalent model.  When you oppose someone you implicitly agree on the subject, framing, and context of the argument while divergent is more heretical. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallin%27s_spheres">Hallin&#39;s Spheres</a> for more information.</p>

<p>I meant isn&#39;t because I&#39;m speaking of something I feel is tautologically true, not subjectively to be considered. And I mean overstated because I mean that something is not to be expressed too strongly.</p>

<p>Imagine a busy club, filled with people. The fire marshal pulls an alarm and completely evacuates it because he thinks some of the conversational topics are better suited to the bar across the street. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like we&#39;re talking about a traditional forum where the thread is just moved to another section, the entire discussion is deleted. It ends up having a much more extreme impact on the conversation than traditional forms of online moderation.</p>

<p>Yep.  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told, on multiple occasions.  Only trouble is, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is a completely owned subsidiary of the DNC.  Not much room for discussion.  In this way, undesirable messages can be effectively filtered out of Reddit....save for this sub and various undelete permutations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to have go ahead and disagree with this.  There are several non grata topics that you would have difficulty gaining exposure for in any of the default subreddits, regardless of that subject&#39;s applicability to the sub and what that sub purposrts to cover.  I&#39;ve been on this site long enough to see it evovle.  You say there is no conspiracy as though that assertion can be stated as fact.  I find that a bit odd.</p>

<p>&quot;We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.&quot; - Buckminster Fuller</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the creation of money is what led us down the road to the blatant idiocy in that Fuller quote.  What if we just traded goods and services directly?  Oh, yeah, that&#39;s the barter system, which was made a lot easier by creating portable objects of standardized value to facilitate trading so you didn&#39;t have to figure out how many chicken eggs equate to a gallon of goat&#39;s milk.  Doing so created a layer of abstraction giving this idiotic impression that money has no inherent value so it should be given away to provide for people&#39;s needs.  Bullshit.</p>

<p>What Fuller, and you are apparently after is a society where a large number of people survive entirely on the efforts of a small, productive, minority working their asses off and getting nothing in return for it.  I mean, if you want to work your ass off and give away what you produce, who am I to stop you? But what happens when those people say, &quot;You know what?  Fuck those freeloaders!&quot;  Wait.  Someone should write a book about this, perhaps involving trains...</p>

<p>Anyway, the point is that having to do something productive to survive is in the very nature of a society.  Hell, even if there wasn&#39;t a society, if you simply want to do jack shit, guess what?  You fucking die.  It&#39;s not some conspiracy of The Man trying to make you a slave.  You&#39;re a slave to biology, chemistry, physics, the universe.  Society is a way we come together to cooperatively deal with this inherent slavery to the universe.  If you depend on someone to make your food and build your house, you owe him something in return.  Something that you are capable of doing that holds value.  Money makes it so you don&#39;t have to do it directly for them (unless you know how to hammer nails and milk cows) you just have to do it for someone who thinks whatever it is you do isn&#39;t worthless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you missed the point of that quote. He isn&#39;t saying &quot;Do jack shit and let John Galt take care of you.&quot; He is saying that if the other 9,999 people not making major technological breakthroughs were able to apply themselves to go back to school and work on projects that interest them, instead of flipping burgers to live hand-to-mouth, perhaps even greater breakthroughs could be made. </p>

<p>You are absolutely correct that if you do nothing, you will have no place in society and will probably die, and I&#39;m not arguing that. The point is that people should be free to advance themselves and society in their own ways, rather than toiling away in drudgery in the name of &#39;earning a living&#39;. The cost of providing survival in today&#39;s world is far lower than ever before. Why should society not attempt to benefit from this, freeing people from cycles of poverty and allowing them to advance in their own ways, if not for some old style Rand-ian argument about &#39;I got mine, get your own!&#39; </p>

<p>I guess the real question is if you want society to be a group of individuals who fight amongst themselves to claw their way to the top, or a collective whole that works towards the betterment of humanity. I would choose the latter, but if you don&#39;t want me to ride your railroads, then have fun with your coming trainwreck.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone&#39;s gotta flip the burgers (or design, build, service, or operate the machine that does it).</p>

<p>Society already benefits from the advances in the form of reduced cost of survival allowing such pursuits.  Hell, it is possible to survive on almost nothing in the form of monetary income already.  It ain&#39;t pretty, but it is possible.  Interestingly enough, if one&#39;s personal advances also work to advance society, then there&#39;s money to be made in that because of the value the rest of society places on those advancements.  The specific pursuits may not be what you or I would call an advancement (like making hand-carved novelty dildos or whatever), but that&#39;s not up to us as individuals.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want a society of people fighting to claw their way to the top.  I certainly want people to pursue their own interests and be rewarded when those interests advance society.  In fact, if that is how an individual claws their way to the top, then I do fully support it. But at the same time, those interests that do not advance society should not be rewarded either and there&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch.</p>

<p>Until we reach the Star Trek-esque &quot;post scarcity&quot; society, there will always be something that individuals (who make up this thing called &quot;society&quot;) will want in more abundance than is available.  As long as that state exists, people will have to cooperate and trade for what they want out of life.  Or through legal or illegal means, steal it.  And even after post-scarcity, there will always be limits on space and time until we become immortal and shed our physical bodies.  Not holding my breath for that one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe manufactured scarcity is a very stable model.  It either fails when alternatives are developed, has to be propped up with law, or is maintained through other artificial means.  If Coca Cola wants to hold back production to drive up prices they can.  Nobody else can make &quot;Coca Cola&quot; because of trademark law. Their marketing department exists to create and maintain value of the brand.  But I can just drink Pepsi if I want to.  I can also buy cheap store-brand cola if I don&#39;t buy into the hype.</p>

<p>In the overall scheme of things, with enough alternatives, needs and wants are pretty much the same thing.  Needs are just higher priority versions of wants.  A shack with some clean water, a wood stove, dog food and salad will keep me alive, but I want a house with a grilled steak on the table.  Not to mention, I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s my place, or anyone else&#39;s, to determine what other people &quot;need&quot; and don&#39;t need.  My arrogance only goes so far.</p>

<p>Yeah, having everyone depend on the Government for a large portion of their income is a great way to break the control they have over the population. /s</p>

<p>Capitalism is the problem; the ownership class and wealth usurpation of the commons is the problem. Government, in its current form, is simply the left hand they use to protect private property and sustain control.  But government, is not the real culprit here. Don&#39;t be fooled. </p>

<p>It is capitalism itself that is the problem.</p>

<p>“I am opposing a social order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing that is useful to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars, while millions of men and women who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough for a wretched existence.”
- Eugene Debs, Statement to the Court, Upon Being Convicted of Violating the Sedition Act, 1918.</p>

<p>As Marx and Engels state, “In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e. capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class developed – a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These labourers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity like every other article of commerce…”</p>

<p>Work today isn’t tied to satisfying OUR needs, it is tied only to satisfying the profit needs of business.</p>

<p>Your argument needs revision, comrade.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is almost as good of an idea as embracing the socialist model of creating monopolies over essential services and giving them powers of State.</p>

<p>Actually, that&#39;s called STATE CAPITALISM. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism</a> </p>

<p>deregulation should be the goal to allow for as many choices as possible to compete against each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, to an extent. But again this does not address the deeper problems of capitalism itself.</p>

<p>You actually misunderstood that.  If you look a bit deeper, the companies who are being PAID to repair and maintain the infrastructure (on a sale-of-infrastructure basis) are <em>also</em> given right over the movement of the water within that infrastructure which they will &#39;own&#39;.</p>

<p>It Literally removes control of public water infrastructure from the public&#39;s hands.</p>

<p>quote: “This bill removes important consumer protections by accelerating the sales of publicly owned systems, limiting voters involvement in the process, and forcing the Board to go along with negotiated contracts that could potentially be harmful for ratepayers,” said Stefanie Brand, the director of the state’s Division of Rate Counsel. “We urge that this bill not be voted out of committee.”</p>

<p>So, I should take your word over this person who has decades of job experience in this specific field?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what a lot of people don&#39;t realize about capitalism is that it&#39;s necessary for it to be tightly regulated to succeed. This is actually foundational - if you read Smith, he argues for regulation. Otherwise, since it&#39;s more profitable to not compete, companies work to usurp the system. A lot of people preach an anarchist &quot;free market&quot; without realizing what capitalism really supposed to be. Then again, this is probably another one of those &quot;ideal&quot; things, at least with the American system of governance - two parties makes it far to easier for those with money to buy interest, it would be much more possible to maintain closer to an ideal capitalist system if there was more competition for political office.</p>

<p>In the end, my personal opinion is that non-ideal capitalism is likely to work better than non-ideal communism - communism requires suppression of self interest, whereas capitalism tries to mitigate self interest by putting different people&#39;s self-interests into opposition. As nice as a system of governance like Star Trek would be, I don&#39;t see it happening until we are completely post-scarcity. I could see a compromise system working though - something like Universal Basic Income, where everyone has enough to survive, but you&#39;re motivated to work because enough to survive will be a pretty subsistence level and you&#39;d need to work for any kind of luxury. With the rise in robotics and computers, we&#39;re approaching an age of diminished scarcity that this might become necessary to keep the system from collapsing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree with everything you said. Without capitalism we wouldn&#39;t attain the means of a post-scarcity society.</p>

<p>I feel we are getting very close to it though. So many jobs could be made obsolete overnight, but not all, yet.</p>

<p>It is also unrealistic to assume that as corporations become more and more efficient and mechanized, that unemployment coupled with exponential population growth, that there be a job for every able bodied person to survive in a capitalist society. Welfare will have to expand. Hopefully soon we will start getting some politicians to suggest some pilot cities that are self sustaining and don&#39;t need capitalism but to opt into it would be giving up some materialism we are conditioned to expect. </p>

<p>For example, it is unrealistic and wasteful to expect everyone to own a car that gets used 5% of the day.</p>

<p>Nope.  Actually its CAPITALISM that creates forced labor.</p>

<p>It is the acquisition of private property and wealth that reveal to be the defining attributes of power and control in the World today. The working class is dependent on those at the top who control the means of production, to provide jobs just in order to survive. As Albert Einstein explains in his work &#39;Why Socialism?, “The profit motive […] is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions […] This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism” (Einstein, 1949:2). It is no longer coercion by way of the club, but by inherent structural violence (Galtung, 1969: 171) through this implementation of classism, where the individual is threatened with the loss of autonomy, risk of homelessness, starving to death, or worse.</p>

<p>the pictures of the holodomor all came from the 1921 famine</p>

<p>there was a famine but it was primarily caused by a poor harvest and kulak bandits</p>

<p>Western capitalist nations are &quot;prosperous&quot; enough to bribe their population with the scraps kicked down by capitalits. But the average person in a third world country is not fat, no idea where you&#39;re getting this from. If 50% of those deaths can be attributed to capitalism, in just 25 years the death toll would exceed even the most outlandish death tolls attributed to Stalin.</p>

<p>No True Scotsman day in and day out. &quot;true&quot; Communism will never &quot;be given a chance&quot; because what defines &quot;true&quot; Communism changes with the winds as each version of &quot;true&quot; Communism results in millions of deaths. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but the ignorance of this statement is astounding.  How many hundreds of millions of people are starving <strong>today</strong> either directly or indirectly as a result of the &quot;democratic&quot; western oligarchs and their globalist policies?  How many hundreds of millions have died under this system?  How can you hate one control system but not the other?</p>

<p>This is false, completely, and tells me that you&#39;ve never done any research into the history of communism or how it&#39;s defined.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>each version of &quot;true&quot; Communism results in millions of deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, false.  There has never been a system that even remotely resembles communism.  Just because Stalin kills people and says he&#39;s doing it &quot;because communism&quot; doesn&#39;t make it so.  This is why it&#39;s in my opinion a waste of time to get hung up on these semantics and ideologies as they lead to people such as yourself blaming the movements and ideas rather than the evil, powerful people using them as tools.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would you assume I think that?</p>

<p>Because you keep talking about &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;capitalism&quot; as if either actually exists in reality - neither does.  Just different systems of control and window dressing to hide the underlying motives which, again, are about the few controlling the many.</p>

<p>First off this is pretty vague - which people are you referring to?  Surely the Palestinians living in the open air prison that is the Gaza strip would disagree with you.  Made possible, of course, by our &quot;democratic&quot; western societies.  That&#39;s one of literally hundreds of examples of people certainly <em>not</em> better off.</p>

<p>Even in the US, we have food - but I would argue that the citizenry has never been dumber, more complacent, more distracted, more propagandized, more controlled, etc. than they/we are today.  Are we really better off, or have we just been tricked into thinking we are?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve spent this entire comment chain arguing that &quot;capitalism&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot; are somehow better than &quot;communism&quot;.  Have you not?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just suggesting that even &quot;real&quot; Communism would be awful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you&#39;re <em>stating</em> that communism by default leads to hundreds of millions of people dead.  This is just a patently false statement, period - I don&#39;t know how many other ways to say it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you ask every Communist leader in history they&#39;ll tell you that it&#39;s real Communism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you ask Obama if he&#39;s practicing democracy, he&#39;ll tell you he is.  News flash man: leaders <strong>lie to people</strong> about their agendas and motives.</p>

<p>Is this really something new for you?  Do you think Stalin is instead going to say, &quot;No, I&#39;m not a Communist - I&#39;m actually a barbaric dictator who cares only about controlling all of you and therefore I&#39;ll tell you whatever you want to hear and pretend to be doing things I&#39;m not in order to distract you long enough to kill you and preserve my power.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not an &quot;apologist&quot;, although I&#39;m not surprised that you&#39;ve accused me as such.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You just... aren&#39;t getting it man.  The same globalists are behind communism and democracy, always have been.  The elite is the elite, countries and ideologies and religions and politics are mostly for show.  There are two groups of people - rulers and those they rule.  Neither system is &quot;better&quot;, they&#39;re both part of the same global power structure and control mechanism.  Communism or capitalism or socialism or democracy or (name your favorite political ideology here) would look a hell of a lot different if implemented properly.</p>

<p>Bottom line:  If Stalin was born in the US, he could just have easily killed millions of people in the name of democracy or socialism.  The people in power are to blame, not the words they hide behind.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not &quot;backing a horse&quot; of any kind, what the hell are you even talking about?  I&#39;m simply explaining to you that &quot;communism&quot; and &quot;capitalism&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot; are just made up words used by the rich and powerful to enslave the rest of us.  In practice, <em>not a single one of them</em> resembles the actual ideologies they claim to represent.  It isn&#39;t really a very complicated point, I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re having such trouble grasping it.</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m suspecting that you&#39;re only here to argue for whatever reason and nothing I say will convince you to look into the origins of these ideologies and who supported them.  Your mind is already made up.</p>

<p>Edit:  I&#39;ll leave you to your own beliefs but let me just re-iterate one last time:  it&#39;s the <strong>people</strong> in power who are the problem, not the bullshit words they use as tools to justify themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good to know but I would be very surprised if that thing lasted more than 24 months (I&#39;m being optimistic). Since the fall of the Ottoman Empire, including the interference of UK and USA, that area of the world is a royal mess where every rival group is struggling for predominance but Kurds are just the &quot;new kid on the block&quot;. I hope they actualize their libertarian utopia but it&#39;s not realistic considering the kind of forces (i.e. money) that are moving there.</p>

<p>And even if, it would still demonstrate that with &quot;nonviolent civil disobedience&quot; you get nowhere because you actually need to fight and die in order to accomplish something, so I rest my case.</p>

<p>Those traveling long distances will need dependable transportation to wherever we choose to embark from (logistics tbd). That particular demographic might benefit from compiling their resources and using forms of mass transit for their journey.</p>

Martin Luther King led the greatest revolution in this country based on Ghandi&#39;s principles of non-violent protests. The US Government understands the power of non-violent protest and works very hard through undercover agents to turn protests violent. Once a protest is viewed as violent then those not engaged with the cause see it as a uncalled for disruption of the status quo and turn off from the message. The Civil Rights movement was greatly aided when Bull Connors unleashed the dogs on peaceful protestors. Once that occured, MLK was going to be victorious. It is important for those protesting to elimnate and have nothing to do with individuals encouraging violence. </p>

<p>Non-violent protest only works up to a certain point, and only if your opponent is unwilling or unable to exercise oppressive means.  If your power elite are insulated, a million people can be marching in the streets and they&#39;ll be like &quot;eh, let&#39;s see how long you can march around before you have to go back to work so you can pay your rent, your mortgage, and buy food.&quot;</p>

<p>At the end, you must have a very dedicated, very focused, and well funded organizational column at the center of your movement holding it together, or else it all collapses as soon as the resources run out.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s put it in the simplest terms. You want, and do use things that you do not pay for.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t want to pay for roads, then don&#39;t use them. If you use things you don&#39;t pay for, you are stealing. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple honestly.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t get to not pay for a bunch of stuff, and then still use stuff you don&#39;t pay for because oh... I wanna.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hypocritical.</p>

<p>I did not ask government to make the roads. They did that of their own accord and I was not involved in any transaction or agreement with them. There is zero documentation to show that I have any obligation to give them money.</p>

<p>So, if I went to your house, mowed your lawn and demanded five hundred dollars would you give it to me whether you asked for it or not? Wouldn&#39;t you be guilty of theft?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well look at that, he tried to make a point that isn&#39;t based in adolescent logic!</p>

<p>No. I wouldn&#39;t be guilty of theft. Such a simplistic analogy you&#39;ve setup, that&#39;s likely the only way you could justify anything.</p>

<p>However, guess what. If you live in a homeowner association, in which the dues you pay take care of everyones lawn, and the pool down the road, and the roads in your community. &quot;OHH BUT I DONT USE THE POOL SO I WONT PAY&#39;&#39; </p>

<p>Then they come mow your lawn, well then you are a thief.</p>

<p>Move out of the community, don&#39;t use the services provided that you do not pay for, or you are a thief.</p>

If there is any intent on being taken seriously, then first you must take your argument seriously and not half-ass it. As it stands now it come across as your average anti-semitism, and where I&#39;m from that is immediately associated with neonazi/nationalism, which in turn time and again is associated with ignorance, mob mentality, and stupidity wrapped up in either punks or hillbillys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what a lot of people don&#39;t realize about capitalism is that it&#39;s necessary for it to be tightly regulated to succeed. This is actually foundational - if you read Smith, he argues for regulation. Otherwise, since it&#39;s more profitable to not compete, companies work to usurp the system. A lot of people preach an anarchist &quot;free market&quot; without realizing what capitalism really supposed to be. Then again, this is probably another one of those &quot;ideal&quot; things, at least with the American system of governance - two parties makes it far to easier for those with money to buy interest, it would be much more possible to maintain closer to an ideal capitalist system if there was more competition for political office.</p>

<p>In the end, my personal opinion is that non-ideal capitalism is likely to work better than non-ideal communism - communism requires suppression of self interest, whereas capitalism tries to mitigate self interest by putting different people&#39;s self-interests into opposition. As nice as a system of governance like Star Trek would be, I don&#39;t see it happening until we are completely post-scarcity. I could see a compromise system working though - something like Universal Basic Income, where everyone has enough to survive, but you&#39;re motivated to work because enough to survive will be a pretty subsistence level and you&#39;d need to work for any kind of luxury. With the rise in robotics and computers, we&#39;re approaching an age of diminished scarcity that this might become necessary to keep the system from collapsing.</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m suspecting that you&#39;re only here to argue for whatever reason and nothing I say will convince you to look into the origins of these ideologies and who supported them.  Your mind is already made up.</p>
