        The root cause is the education system, we have been programmed for obedience:

       <p>
        The root cause of societyâ€™s ills is how we deal with education. Deep down we all know this, but for decades we have barely lifted a finger to address it. The main reason for this inaction is because most of us are ourselves products of this defective system. We have been programed for obedience, turned into self-absorbed apathetic beings that submit to authority and fear dissent.

       Because of the fourth branch of government, the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       On 9/11/2001, the media moved in lockstep with the government's agenda and propaganda. If you were paying attention, you could no longer pretend that we had a free media concerned with the truth.

       It's pretty interesting that the word "collapse" stuck to all three 3 towers when the video footage in front of your eyes shows them demolished in the span of seconds. They did not fall over, they were utterly and completely destroyed, from standing building to pile of rubble in just slightly longer than complete freefall.

       follow the money..always follow the money it is the core value of any investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       look at who controls the worlds biggest companies it boils down to a handful of men and women 32 actually
      </p>
      <p>
       if they want something gone its gone..they controll everything..almost 99% of the media if they dont want it in the news it will never make it.
      </p>
      <p>
       you ask why no one has heard of it..well that tells me they are doing there job very very well..hey dont look over there at that building look over here..eat more of our GMO crops and sugar..come get distracted by the other things we have created since we screwed up so bad on 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       these people dont need money its not even about that any more its about power..how can they get it and how more of it they control this world like a chess board look at what they have at there command.
armies 
presidents
secret military 
hell ill even go as far to say off world armies or military
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no end to their reach..but we can only follow the paper trail so far before it dies
      </p>
      <p>
       if you are looking around you and asking questions that no one else is and no one has ever heard of this or that or know about it..well your awake to their plans my friend the problem you have now is how do explain it all without looking like a nutjob..because well..the higher powers will expect that to happen..after all thats what they want

       Because fires that cannot burn hot enough to weaken steel 9 hours after they started did, and the pancake collapse defied the laws of physics while it was happening, obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the collapse happened the world should start updating existing buildings to make sure they don't collapse when there is an office fire. But that's not a priority

       There has been a very concerned effort to dispel any talk of conspiracy by ridicule as well as an elaborate explanation for the collapse that seeks to complicate and confuse the dynamics of the collapse such that people will doubt their own ability to understand the simplicity of it.
