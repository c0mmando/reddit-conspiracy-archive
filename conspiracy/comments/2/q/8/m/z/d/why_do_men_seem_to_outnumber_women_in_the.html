<p>Anyone have any ideas as to why that may be? Is it due to some biological difference, social conditioning, or some other factor? Has anyone else pondered this issue and come to any conclusions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I know what you mean. Especially in the ct forums, I have found the dialogue to be pretty cutthroat sometimes. I read and lurk far, far more often than I post. And, when I do post to a ct discussion, I never identify as female - mostly because I want to be judged by the merits of my posts rather than my gender. It can be a very intimidating environment, but good on you for switching from lurker to active poster!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason women are not as vocal on conspiracy forums or otherwise is that we all have anonymity thru sites. Some women feel they wont be taken seriously so they dont divulge their gender.</p>

<p>Who is to say they are not active on here as much as men?  With the abundance of harsh comments and down votes it discourages them from posting. Women seem to have to get acceptance for their views before they share them. Not to even suggest they are wrong its just that females seem to think it has to be accepted to be important enough to talked about.</p>

<p>Thats what I think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media sells the &quot;official story&quot; of everything with strong emotional delivery rather than with facts and reason. Nancy Grace is the most guilty of this in my opinion. Stereotypically, women are more emotionally driven in their decisions. A mother of a 4 year old is more likely to buy the Sandy Hook official story because she can sympathize with the faces of the &quot;victims&quot; and their (not) crying mothers plastered all over CNN. </p>

<p>Tl;Dr If you buy into the fearmongering of the mainstream media, you&#39;re less likely to question what really happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m female and I give a shit. But, perhaps I just have different priorities than most women.</p>

<p>So, your theory is that women are socially conditioned to care about different things (shopping, appearance, tv &amp; celebrities). Then, what are men socially conditioned to care about that makes them more interested in conspiracies than the average woman?</p>

<p>Another thought... Conspiracy theorists are overwhelmingly white males. Could it be that the disenfranchisement that white men seem to be facing drives them to sek answers and thus propels them down the rabbit hole?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is because women are more &#39;societally minded,&#39; which is to say that traditionally, they were the underpinning of society and culture. Whereas men would go off to work or hunt or war or whatever, women were the caregivers and keepers of the household.</p>

<p>The corollary of this is that it has been women who create society. They are therefore more interested in preserving society, and therefore the idea that something might be terribly wrong with society, particularly something that threatens its very existence is doubly distressing for them.</p>

<p>Women&#39;s power comes from collaboration more so than does mens. Therefore they fear division more than men. Therefore they seek to preserve the status quo more than men, abide by the rules of society more, and generally seek an outcome that preserves society even if it is imperfect.</p>

<p>The cognitive dissonance of simultaneously seeking to preserve a society yet knowing that it is corrupt and not worthy of preservation leads women to shut out ideas that might degrade the extent to which they esteem the establishment.</p>

<p>Personally, I lament that women as the cornerstone of society has been undermined by feminist ideology. Women are now forced to work just as much as men. They would probably say &quot;allowed&quot; but let&#39;s be real – hardly anyone has their dream job and we would all rather be doing something else. Something productive, but not simple slavery to this insane system.</p>

<p>Personally, I hope that ideas like basic income will allow many women to resume their natural role of society&#39;s glue, freed from the necessity of earning a wage just to survive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s no different reason than seeing less women in high ranking capitalist societies&#39; positions. The discussions, even around here, are very often of no avail, coloured aggressively and even counterproductive.
I think that we, in our range of understanding of the worldly experience live in a male dominated world. This is not to be mistaken by &#39;human&#39; male dominance. But the theory of Ying and Yang. One cannot exist without the other and in order for both to grow and evolve they have to &#39;push and pull&#39; each other. And by our interpretation the one seems &#39;dominant&#39; to us. But, if you witnessed the variety of &#39;dominance&#39; between men and women in relationships of any kind, you&#39;ll see a very different picture. In our personal life we see, if we are truly freed individuals, as much male as female dominance around us (I could go much deeper here...).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think I have ever openly identified myself as female in a ct discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s kinda the point. That humanity still discusses equality, but is to afraid to live it. Shouldn&#39;t have to make a difference for anyone. Instead, parts of the human consciousness try to blur the borders.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are right that there are less females on forums like these. But from my experience with people, however they were conditioned and wherever they are from, I feel the main reason why women participate less in certain social structures is the lack of respect and appreciation for one another.
Most people tell themselves not to be afraid, but ironically fear the loss of their phony worldview so much, that their very programming denies them to accept the bright and the shadowy spots in themselves. And by doing so they push others away.</p>

<p>In my country I&#39;ve witnessed an endless discussion about the enforcement of a 30% quota for women in leadership positions. Coming from a rather feminist hued education I observed the debates with suspicion. Because I know the reason why there are less. And I know that striking out the symptoms doesn&#39;t solve the complex of problems.</p>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t mind giving you some hints:</p>

<p>My country is truly a corporation. In rare occasions it is even referred to as such by its most powerful representatives. The remainders of its governmental independence are being rigged by their &#39;colonial&#39; suppressors. Every elected head of state must secretly swear allegiance to them, or else. Nobody knows what would happen if they decided to break the collaboration, because no one ever dared to poke the beast. It is a first world country that is famous for its poets and thinkers; and embarrassed for its history. It is often referred to as one of the leading countries world wide in lots of fields, yet it is one of the least independent. Censorship is a huge problem that does not play role in the open debate at all; in the country itself at least. You cannot really research contemporary history, because it is contrary to the desired programming and you will be held accountable and prosecuted for publicly educating others about it. From this country a lot of human rights violations and acts of terror all around the world are planned and executed on a &#39;legal&#39; basis, without the consent of its people, parliament or even governance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve met some, but the style of thought seems tailor-made for the male brain.</p>

<p>For whatever reason men have this statistical proclivity for abstract thought absent context that is less significant in women. The word &#39;context&#39; is important. Women have, in my experience, statistically been more context-aware than the men I&#39;ve known. They&#39;ll normally take the context as something that&#39;s &quot;a given&quot; and then make decisions based on that context. In terms of navigating the world this is an extremely pragmatic and useful style of thought. They can make informed and reasoned decisions in ways that most men find confabulating. On the other hand they might not look as deeply into things that don&#39;t concern them. Why waste time on a piece of information that doesn&#39;t meaningfully modify your decision?</p>

<p>The thing that makes this funny to me is that men have a statistically higher likelihood of moving toward abstract thought. And some of these guys will get really into it. And then while they spend all of their time on this abstract thought - they do nothing. On the one hand women are fucking doing things and making shit happen. Look at a guy pontificating and he&#39;ll be smart, sure, but he&#39;s not doing much with it.</p>

<p>A balance in both styles of thought is what&#39;s needed.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see more women in here, but I&#39;d also love to see men actually do things about what they know. So often I see smart guys bitching and moaning and refusing to do anything about their woes. Ask yourself how many within this sub still pay tribute [Federal Income Tax]? How many still pay parking tickets? How many people in here still vote? If you know their system is bullshit and spend time researching how bullshit their system is and yet still play their godamn games then you&#39;re just as bad as anyone else who&#39;s completely ignorant.</p>

<p>Oh yeah.</p>

<p>I once heard about a woman who went through a chemical female-to-male process. She said that the moment the testosterone hit her body (well, &quot;he&quot; now) he found that he was much more interested in facts, data and abstract thought. I really do think that there&#39;s a chemical element to it. Not that the chemicals themselves are responsible and no other considerations are of importance. It&#39;s just that I do think that there&#39;s a subtle difference.</p>

<p>When I talk about these things to my female friends they have interest for a while, but the gravity of the situation always seems lost on them. On the other hand they&#39;re fully connected with their real-life environment in ways that are beyond me. So it&#39;s not like I&#39;m &quot;more aware&quot; than they are. If anything they&#39;re more aware of their real-life surroundings than I am. There&#39;s a joke in here somewhere. I can feel it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard about a connection between testosterone and autism. Some autistics have tremendous fact retention and unbreakable concentration. </p>

<p>But ultimately I think it has to do with the options available. Women tend to have more options for social life and acceptance that are by definition denied to men. And just like the rats that became addicted to morphine when locked in cages yet do not when placed in a stimulating environment, woman just have better things to do. They have a &quot;life&quot;. If they were denied opportunities to socialize maybe they would care.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s the same thing behind porn addiction. Women can often have a sex drive that outstrips any man. But they&#39;re never addicted to porn because they have more real life opportunities. </p>

<p>So what is it about belief in conspiracy theory? I propose that, today, this has been portrayed as being somehow anti-social. It definitely does not represent conformity. So perhaps this has something to do with the gender bias among conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>I think that men comprehend that if you spend all day trolling over information about another person like you were a detective then you can uncover things about another person.  Men understand that if you get together and &quot;talk shit&quot; about a person that you can get things on them.  This is a base and low class function and not compatible with people who are achieving and doing.  Its simply women bathing in negativity.</p>

<p>So sure if you share enough information then there will be nuggets of relevance in it.  Its even worse in the old Soviet Bloc.  They just literally spend all day observing and spying on each other with the intention of having some small bit of value to offer each other for no personal gain but simply to stimy their immense boredom.  I realized in L&#39;viv that they were supposedly all afraid of the KGB but in reality they were being tyranized by the babushkas.  When that feminine spying impulse goes completely unchecked in a dictatorship then you end up with being afraid to so much as twitch wrong.  Its the women who held that system together and they are wretched for it.  A man will share certain information with just a few people while then women derive their societal value from sharing with dozens to hundreds of people and the more relevant those factoids are perceived to be the more sick and innane the society is.  Its my opinion that there is always a fair amount of malace around that female information stream as they protect their own privacy by never saying anything to anybody about their own, period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because more females them males tend to benefit from conspiracies, either imagined or real. Plus, male conspiracies are no longer conspiracies. </p>

<p>easy example. </p>

<p>assume we have 100 men and 100 women. </p>

<p>all are affected by various conspiracies. conspiracies on race, religion or creed. There, we have a roughly even spread. </p>

<p>Fuck it. letrs say it like it is, what affects a man, affects a woman. Thus, on our random panel, if x number of men are affected, X number of women are affected. </p>

<p>Now, assume a conspiracy is done by males, and exists. According to the theory, it would benefit males, and females would counbt as the victims of this conspiracy, right? </p>

<p>Except this is no longer a conspiracy. It is a patriarchal good old boys club. Which, according to feminist doctrine, are true, and thus do not need to appear as conspiracy, but cn be passed on as political truth. </p>

<p>Thus, Thus, all those women affected by the male conspiracy could either hang with the conspoiracy crowd, or hang with the feminists, which get things done. </p>

<p>Easy pick. </p>

<p>Second would be the men. Assume there is a conspiracy out there that is done by women, with a purpose to affect men. Hello, to assume such a thing even exists is sexist towards feminists, not to mention the LGBTQ++-- field they represent. 
So, it is more then likely that such a conspiracy does not even hit the mainstream, but remains inside and underground, or else all that paricipate will face reprecussions. </p>

<p>Thus, the likelyhood that a male protester is unable to move the conspoiracy theory onwards is zero, and most likely, it will never leave the underground. </p>

<p>Thuis, at least in my opinion, it is a numbers game. females have a better argument to take their conspoiracy theories mainstream, and make them heard. Thus, they will not show off as much on the CT Boards, thus there will be an appearance of no females on this board, sorry. </p>

<p>End result: The only thing I am saying, women conspiracy theorists exist, queer gay lesbian and whossname conspiracy theoriests exist. </p>

<p>But unlike male conspiracy theorists, they have other venues to make their voices heard. </p>

<p>I find it an honor and a priviledge to be posting here, knowing I will be lurked by at least 1 female conspiracy theorist. </p>

I mean, when going down the rabbit hole, it really pulls the reality rug out from under a person - perhaps the male psyche generally tolerates that better...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with women wanting security to a greater degree than men. Most females eventually want to raise children at some point... and finding truth in conspiracy theories eradicates the security necessary to do that in good conscience (for me personally, at least).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree. Although popular liberal ideology forces the idea upon us that men and women are the same, there are biological differences between men and women (hormones being the obvious example). I also think generally speaking, men and women are prone to their maternal and paternal instincts. Those hormones and instincts have an effect on our behaviour.</p>

<p>I discovered ct when I was faced with the decision to give my daughter the live polio vaccine in the pediatrician&#39;s office and delved into vaccine research. Had it not been for that event, I might never have looked deeper. It was all downhill from there.</p>

I wish I had stopped my daughter&#39;s vaccinations sooner; I just didn&#39;t know any better. My kids are 16 and 13 now, and I have no regrets about their lack of vaccinations. Feel free to message me any time. I know, it is not an easy decision to make as a parent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know one or two female friends who are interested in conspiracies, maybe three of four. But most of the people who I have come across that are interested in conspiracies are male. </p>

<p>I also think the same might be true for politics in general. </p>

<p>If this is true, I don&#39;t think it is to do exclusively with conspiracy theories, it probably relates back to the patriarchal world in which we live, for the most part anyway.</p>

<p>I think the answer to your question lies within the general male dominance that we see in most areas of society, particularly within government. </p>

<p>Interesting question though.  </p>
