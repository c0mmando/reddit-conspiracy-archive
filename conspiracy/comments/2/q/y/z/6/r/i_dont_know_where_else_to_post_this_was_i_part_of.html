       something is bothering me. in 1999 when i was in the 4th grade in a small new hampshire town that i had just moved to, some outside teachers from our class wheeled a tv in and showed my class an animation that was pretty disturbing and asked us to tell them what it meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       since then i haven't been able to find this animation despite hours of searching the internet and i need to see it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't remember much but here's what i can remember:
      </p>
      <p>
       the style was minimalist and similar to how most political cartoons are drawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't remember there being dialogue
      </p>
      <p>
       i remember part of the story was this young boy having a board strapped to his head, the adult (parent?) always tying the board tighter, looked painful. when the board finally came off later on, it was a mold of the bottom of a shoe. i remember another adult coming to the boy and fitting his shoe in the imprint left on the boys head.
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe we were later told it was about the cold war or something but being a fucking 9 year old i didn't get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       i did however understand the oppression displayed in this film on a level that made me feel really uneasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       help me find it please? was this some weird brainwashing? was anyone else shown this as a kid?
      </p>
      <p>
       thanks for reading.

       thank you all for reading, commenting and sharing your similar stories. if you experienced something similar i don't mind if you post it here at all. seems quite a few people experienced something similar in their childhood.

       This reminds me of what O'Brien says to Winston at the end of 1984.

       This sounds very familiar to me. I also remember being taken out of class for one on one tutoring which consisted of being asked how I would respond to certain complex situations and memorizing long stings of numbers and names. I must have not done to well as it all seemed to stop around age 11.

       They used to do psych experiments like this on little kids. In my school it was the Albatross people. A group of people 'visiting' our school from a small island in the Pacific, with different customs than ours. We met them in the auditorium and they gave a presentation and stuff and later we were asked about it.

       I've seen the wall a lot of times and don't remember anything like the shoe scene. That said, the film is content rich and there's almost always something new to catch.

       Absolutely!  I've asked about the video I was shown in other places (not Reddit) and have never gotten any answers.  This was about 30 years ago, and it definitely has had an impact on me.

       I remember in elementary school several very strange situations pressed on the class and observed by teachers ect... the one that jumps to my mind was a video my class was shown like in 4th grade or about there about a red balloon and a blue balloon there was no dialog but the balloons got into a series of situations designed to illicit emotional empathy for them. I remember having very strong emotional attachment to the red balloon and a protective feeling over the blue one lol. over the years I have asked people about the short film. my btothers have all seen it and all my friends that grew up aroind here friends from out of state dont seem to know what im talking about....this would have been back in the early 80's hope this helps.

       Sounds like a test for autism, There is another one with randoms shapes moving around the screen, then someone asks you questions about them, and the situations the shapes were in. Someone with autism, might find it hard to understand, where as a child without autism, will understand. despite there being no humans, faces, or dialog.

       after my first year there they moved us all to a new school. most of the teachers left before i graduated 8th grade and records are usually thrown out after 6 years, so i doubt if i called they'd have info but i could still try... i'm afraid of sounding insane.

       Reading the comments, I can't help but get the feeling this was some kind of programming. You all became sleeper agents by virtue of watching your corresponding videos. The videos are impossible to find because so few were made and the government (CIA?) keeps them in storage, only to be used, at a time they deem appropriate, to awaken you.
