    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Plenty of people. The problem is it&#39;s not just fucking over Russia, it&#39;s  going to make domestic oil production in the US, Canada, and a bunch of other &quot;Rothschild&quot; countries unprofitable (and if there&#39;s one thing we care about it&#39;s $) allowing OPEC to retain their strangle hold. The looney and a bunch of other currencies have taken a nose dive alongside the ruble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the fact that the market has a price range that runs up, what 7 fold during the decade and then back down again is proof the entire price is fixed on whatever cartel of OPEC and U.S. decides to throttle it...for whatever reason, perhaps the current Russian situation.</p>

<p>It makes no sense that a commodity which in the aggregate is analogous to merely a faucet leaking out of the Earth can have such an enormous price fluctuation.  Even agriculture, which is effected by so many unknowns, like weather especially, doesn&#39;t have this decade-long dramatic swing.</p>

<p>It is a tough situation though, because oil will likely run dry this century, and so the cartel&#39;s ability to raise prices, for all the ridiculous reasons, especially war, also manages to extend the period of oil availability...it runs the global oil production across the plateau, rather than a normal Hubbert&#39;s peak, up and then dropping fast...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more likely they are more concerned with keeping the lid on American shale in the near term.  If the shale infrastructure develops to a certain level,  prices will drop to a degree that saudi can&#39;t sustain long term. If they can nip shale development it could extend their hegemony over the markets longer than if us shale really gets going. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how I think they did it.  Do you remember up till a few weeks before Kerry went to meet with Saudi Arabia there was a lot of talk about them releasing the pages of the 9/11 report that implicated Saudi Arabia.  Lots of high level people were calling for it&#39;s release.   Kerry went to visit, not a peep about that story any more. </p>

<p>I think they used the threat as leverage to sell them on the benefits of keeping oil prices low for awhile so they could screw Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not USA specifically, but a large contingent of European countries as well. Through the Rothchildes family IMF banking system. Their assets are tied into the Petro Dollar. When Putin and what they call &quot;the family&quot; who control Russian finances. Decided to take upon themselves the creation of BRICS Banks with China, Brazil, and India and South Africa as their own monetary system of trade to compete with the trading PetroDollar. Well they just pissed off the Rothchilde family, and are now getting a taste of how they put the smackdown on those who get out of line. Rothchilde family controls all f banking and even the House of Saud do their bidding. </p>

<p>After they have caused instability in Russia and Putin is out. They will fix the production and inflate prices of oil. even to the point of doubling the original point where it was at peak. This how they will pay back the House of Saud for their loyalty with extra profits so the Saudis can pay back their deficit, and even profit more for their sacrifice.. You thought gas was expensive last summer. just wait about 2 years. it will provably be 8 to 9 dollars USD a gallon.</p>

<p>Russians are not strong enough against the Rothchilde&#39;s. Remember Venezuela,  Libya and Syria were planning on joining BRICS Bank also. Look what happened to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just simple supply and demand operating in the market.  Saudi and other producers haven&#39;t changed their production levels much.  Many of them (such as Venezuela, Iran) can&#39;t cut production because their entire govt budget is built around oil revenue.  Expected production drops in Libya and Iraq (due to fighting) didn&#39;t happen.  US has produced more.  Demand is weakening as economies in China and EU weaken.  Result: lower prices.</p>
