       Thats irrelevant. It's irrelevant because there have been buildings which have had a far larger percentage of them damaged and consumed by fire, and none collapsed. But again, lets be real, those buildings didnt collapse, they vaporized into pyroclastic dust at free fall speed. A gravitational collapse would have been a lot slower.

        Just about every passenger flight is carrying some freight along with the passengers and their baggage. The U.S. Postal Service alone leases space on 15,000 of the approximately 25,000 scheduled passenger flights each day. Commercial airlines make about 5 to 10 percent of their revenue from hauling freight.

       Israel/Vatican/Saudis= Spiritual Centers.  Bank of London= Financial Center.  Federal Reserve/Pentagon= Military Center.  All work together to keep themselves at the top.  "Mossad", "CIA", "United States of America", Israel, England, are all just "corporations" essentially that are used to control the world population.  They do not care about the continuance of national sovereignty, and are actually fighting to destroy it(in no uncertain terms) to bring about world gov't.  Even Israel will sack its sovereignty when the time comes.

       Sorry, can you specifically point me to some excerpts that detail the command of a stand down order, or diversion? The example I know of is Norman Mineta's testimony, whose words appear to be taken out of context in films like Loose Change. It was clear from Mr. Mineta's full testimony that "yes, order still stands" exchange was actually in reference to the order that Bush and Cheney made to actually shoot down the plane on it's way to the Whitehouse. Of course, the jets from Langley did not make it in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was hoping for leaked documents or testimony from whistleblowers.

       And that's why the plane was shot down, right?  Cheney changed his story, placing himself elsewhere.  Rumsfeld, while he was ABSOLUTELY required to PHYSICALLY SIGN OFF on any interception - a policy changed just prior to 9/11, then silently rolled back to its original, effective use, is absent during the entire "attack" then instead of being in charge of our defence, decides the most effective use of his time is picking up trash on the Pentagon lawn.  It's not simple mistakes, it's treasonous dereliction of duty.

       I'm not telling a story. I am asking you to defend yours. I brought up the Mineta testimony because I suspected you may be referring to it as proof (like many before you) and I wanted to let you know what I thought of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for that link, It doesn't appear to say anything I didn't know, it just seems to twist the testimony (deliberately leaving out some of the correspondence). As for your other claims in your comment, I didn't see a reference to them in the document.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, It's clear you and I have different standards of evidence and any sort of conclusion won't be reached. Seems a bit pointless to continue any further.

       Since your intelligence level is really showing here, I'll keep this simply so you can understand.  Earlier in this chain, someone stated
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "if there is one dead-give-away it is defending the official version of 911, clueless-ignorant, troll or shill? the audience decides."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This fits your behavior here to a T.  Later another poster claims your flowchart responses supporting the "official story" (key word story, as in made up fiction) gives you away for exactly what you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize its hard to keep up, especially when being called out so publicly.  Stick with it, and you may sway some hearts and minds.  it's unlikely, but hey, that's what you're tasked with doing anyway.  Good luck, friend.  Best of luck in yur future pro-govt. lies postings.

       You piece of shit. Do you not realize what you've just done!
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure. For you this may be just an internet forum. For me, I had no choice. Do you know what these people are like? Once you get into bed with them, there is no way out. I can't just quit. Why do you think there are no whistleblowers that make it out of this operation. Because you are part of it until you die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that you've made me, I am no longer of use to them. I fear the knock at my door any moment. A disposal agent will arrive and I will never be heard from again, replaced instead by a crisis actor who has been trained to mirror my personality and mannerisms exactly. My death will be a false flag, just like 9/11, Sandy Hook, Aurora and that time the Baltimore Ravens won the Super Bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should be at myself more than you. You were too skilled in the art of anti-shilling. Your ability to eschew pesky things like proof or any sort of defined and tested criteria was something I had not forseen. Your ability to speculate wildly based on my views alone is a level of conspiracy theorist genius that I have yet to come across. Truly you are a master of baseless speculation that is somehow unbelievably the truth!
      </p>
      <p>
       Good night. I hope my final admission reaches you before the Puppet-Masters delete any evidence that I existed off this earth. Go now, be true! Use my admission to continue to strike at the heart of our now mutual enemy. You already know their identity, oh brave theorist, all that is left to do is continue your righteous crusade.

       That is seriously one of the most irritating responses I can think of. IMHO, the people who claim they
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       who was behind 9/11 are just as annoying as people who believe the official story. We simply do not have enough information to know conclusively who was behind the attacks. There are many actors who are suspects but you cannot say "pfft everyone knows it was Bush" like it's so simple to prove and then when someone asks for information, you say "look it up". If it's so obvious, give him the conclusive data and put it to bed.

      <p>
       if a person who has spent years researching an issue, consuming massive amounts of content, was to go and fetch a particular piece of content per your request, theres a good chance that their time would be wasted because you, the audience, has already demonstrated a lack of ambition to do your own research and learn background info on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       for the same reason that you have thus far chose to cling to the official story and avoid/reject anything that contradicts it for the last 13 years, is why introducing you to new information is utterly pointless today.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you really want to learn, if you are sincere, you will "look it up" on your own and come to your own conclusions. nobody on the internet can do your learning for you. its like cheating on your math homework all semester long and then wondering why you don't understand the problems in the final exam.

       No. Part of being well researched is being able to distill your years spent looking for information into an easily accessible and understandable format so that people can take that information and do their own further research.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you act so sure of yourself and say something like "everybody knows [something]", then it should be simple to show how that is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right, no one can learn things for you, but you can certainly help people with shortcuts you have picked up along the way. IMHO, the whole point of spending hours reading about corruption and conspiracy theories is to make other people aware of what is happening with their money, and part of that is the art of helping people when they ask instead of telling you to do it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about lack of ambition on the part of the questioning party, it's about backing up a claim someone arrogantly makes.

       Albino Luciani, who became John Paul I, known as the Smiling Pope, reigned for only 33 days. He announced to the world that he intended to make sweeping changes to the Vatican and to the Roman Church, he went to bed, and he never woke up. The odds that he was poisoned by Vatican officials are almost certain.

       That the Moon - which is steadily departing Earth's orbit and therefore getting smaller from our perspective - is exactly the same size in the sky as our Sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just so happens that millions of years ago, before humans existed, the Moon was "larger" than the Sun (from our point of view). Now, when humans are around to see it, it's the same size as the Sun and we can have perfect eclipses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Millions of years from now, it will be smaller.

       This is not true.  It is a statement used by creationists to convince people that god had a reason to put the moon where he did.  I remember hearing Richard Dawkins talking about this issue and it being BS.

       I like the part where the number 864 relates the two things that define the day and rule over life on earth like gods. The first is the sun, whose diameter is almost exactly 864,000 miles (864,300 modern value). The second is the second, or time  - 86,400 seconds per day.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's the moon, who's diameter is 2160 miles - with 216 being equal to 6x6x6... And Lucifer means "light bringer" right? Cast out from the sun god... Rules over the darkness... Metaphor?
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, I think the people who came up with these units knew a lot more than we give them credit for.

       It gets even weirder than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The diameter of the sun is 864,000 miles (432,000 mile radius). The diameter of the moon is 2,160 miles.  In Sumerian religion the ancient kings of the world ruled for 432,000 years before the flood. In the old testament the ancient kings ruled for 86,400 weeks before the flood. The ancient Hindu ages last 432,000 years. In the book of Exodus, it is said that God's true name is 216 letters long. Moses came down Mt. Sinai and ushered in the age of Aries, 2,160 years later Jesus ushered in the age of Pisces (this is where the Jesus-fish comes from). And the biggest bomb of them all? The height of the Great Pyramid of Giza (metres) x 43,200 = The exact polar radius of the Earth. The perimeter of the Great Pyramid of Giza x 43,200 = the exact circumference of the Earth. 432²= the speed of light in metres/second.

       Ahh so that's why half the perimeter is equal to the earths rotational velocity in meters per second! And I didn't know about the polar radius and the height tho. Nice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you meant that 432 squared is the speed of light in miles per second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also that whole thing about the digits in the latitude of the great pyramid being identical to those in the speed of light. And the width of the missing cap being 10.0m across further confirmation of their knowledge of the circumference of earth.

       I heared that the fish came from the word for fish IHTOS which was used as an acronym ( for iesus hristos is my/our lord or similar) by early christians in rome as their sign on the walls, due to being persecuted
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: looked it up, I hope Wikipedia is  good enough
 Quote: "ΙΧΘΥΣ (Ichthus) is an acronym/acrostic[4] for "Ίησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ", (Iēsous Christos, Theou Yios, Sōtēr), which translates into English as "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour".
      </p>
      <p>
       Iota (i) is the first letter of Iēsous (Ἰησοῦς), Greek for "Jesus".
Chi (ch) is the first letter of Christos (Χριστός), Greek for "anointed".
Theta (th) is the first letter of Theou (Θεου), Greek for "God's", the genitive case of Θεóς, Theos, Greek for "God".
Upsilon (y) is the first letter of (h)uios[5] (Υἱός), Greek for "Son".
Sigma (s) is the first letter of sōtēr (Σωτήρ), Greek for "Savior"."

       Regarding Oswald, I found it interesting that, as a child, he was in the Civil Air Patrol with David Ferrie, a known pedophile. This is speculation, but Oswald would've seemed like a perfect target for someone like that: a loner, a fractured family structure, etc.
This idea has been bugging me for a while, given what we know about covert operations and their relationship with amoral and "transgressive" sexuality (pedophilia, sex trafficking, sexual murder).

       George W Bush and John Kerry(Ran against each other in '04 for President) belong/belonged to the "Skull and Bones" secret society at Yale.  Considering this is a club for the elite of the elite(and probably contains somewhere around .001% of the population, it is A FUCKING INSANE COINCIDENCE that we get to choose from out of 300 million Americans, and our choice is from two people from a secret society that probably has less members in its History than there are current members of congress.

       TRIVIA:  THE "Don't taze me bro" guy who got tazed, got tazed while asking Kerry about "Skull and Bones" Another coincidence.  Kerry now is one of the most influential people in politics(along with Kerry, Gore, Mccain, almost like they got "paid off" to lose).  I'm sure it's all coincidences.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, both the Democratic and Republican nominees were alumni. George W. Bush wrote in his autobiography, "[In my] senior year I joined Skull and Bones, a secret society; so secret, I can't say anything more."[25] When asked what it meant that he and Bush were both Bonesmen, former Presidential candidate John Kerry said, "Not much, because it's a secret."[26][27]

       Excellent point! I'd add that NK is the only "enemy" of the US without much ability to retaliate monetarily or militarily. Its like Mike Tyson picking on a high school wrestler who's a total jerk and not really all there in the head. Also helps they're almost universally condemned by the worlds powers, similar to how Nazis are the enemy in games far more than Japan and Italy.

       Homefront was a gripping campaign where they used EMP to disable most of the US. I recall one cutscene where you are on a bus while a soldier shoots a girls parent right in front of her. I was like WTF

       That all the countries that don't have central banks with Western controlled central bankers running things, happen to be the same exact countries that the United States and NATO seem to have problems with. I'm sure that doesn't have anything to do with the fact that these countries want to control their own natural resources and the currency that values them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the countries the United States is currently beefing with, its the ones that aren't in debt to Anglo-American bankers, like Syria, Iran, North Korea. You can take Iraq and Libya off of that increasingly short list of truly sovereign nations.

       China is definitely run by some global elite. Whether or not they have separated from the Anglo centrist elite is up for debate. But in my opinion there is no better way to destroy the West economically than to have a super strong fascist producer of goods that are made extremely cheap and without regard to life in general.

Thus, if a loan is at 5%, the State, after 20 years, has paid out a sum equal to the borrowed capital.

          A loan is an issue of Government paper which entails an obligation to pay interest amounting to a percentage of the total sum of the borrowed money. If a loan is at 5%, then in 20 years the Government would have unnecessarily paid out a sum equal to that of the loan in order to cover the percentage. In 40 years it will have paid twice; and in 60 thrice that amount, but the loan will still remain as an unpaid debt.— Protocols, p. 77

       It's not particularly hard. Dialogues was written far earlier, so the Protocols are clearly a plagiarism of it instead of the other way around (not to mention Dialogues is actually about Napoleon). There isn't really a chicken/egg issue here.

       Well, dialogues wasn't written far earlier if it was a plagiarism of the much older protocols.

       The chronology only works when you assume forgery, then you support that with the chronology.

       Actually, the Protocols claim to have been very late 19th century (1880's/90's), which Dialogue is 1860's. And considering the actual document surfaced years after the claimed date (first appeared in 1905), I don't see how this is even a question.

       Are you serious? This is a work that is claimed as actual minutes of a group's meeting. To have them be pretty much word for word taken from a completely unrelated text makes it pretty damn obvious it's fake.

       claimed by who to be the minutes of a meeting? clearly if it quotes reference works then it was not. and frankly a document of that depth, breadth and scope is impossible to be formulated during a single meeting. no doubt discussions took place but the writing was finalized afterword. the people who wrote it were not studying for an exam they did not have to reword their sources for fear of losing points.

        The Protocols purports to document the minutes of a late 19th-century meeting of Jewish leaders discussing their goal of global Jewish hegemony by subverting the morals of Gentiles, and by controlling the press and the world's economies.

       I like the part where the number 864 relates the two things that define the day and rule over life on earth like gods. The first is the sun, whose diameter is almost exactly 864,000 miles (864,300 modern value). The second is the second, or time  - 86,400 seconds per day.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's the moon, who's diameter is 2160 miles - with 216 being equal to 6x6x6... And Lucifer means "light bringer" right? Cast out from the sun god... Rules over the darkness... Metaphor?

       At any rate, I think the people who came up with these units knew a lot more than we give them credit for.

       NK is the go-to enemy because there is not a market for games and movies there. Making a state like Russia or China the bad guy is not as smart considering the growing number of people in those markets who are buying these games.

        Just about every passenger flight is carrying some freight along with the passengers and their baggage. The U.S. Postal Service alone leases space on 15,000 of the approximately 25,000 scheduled passenger flights each day. Commercial airlines make about 5 to 10 percent of their revenue from hauling freight.
