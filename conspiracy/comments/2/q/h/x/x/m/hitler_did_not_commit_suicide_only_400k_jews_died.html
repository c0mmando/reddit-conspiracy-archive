        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just finished reading this book</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gestapo-Chief-Interrogation-Heinrich-Muller/dp/0912138629">http://www.amazon.com/Gestapo-Chief-Interrogation-Heinrich-Muller/dp/0912138629</a></p>

<p>and it really opened my eyes to the way history has been re-written by the winners to make the Germans look worse than they really are.  Although I don&#39;t believe all the claims that Müller makes, he says that he thinks Hitler escaped to Spain and so do the Russians and the Americans, because otherwise, why were they still looking for him in 1948.</p>

<p>He also says that the records captured by the Russians in the concentration camps match those at the Berlin HQ and that 400k Jews died in the concentration camps, mostly from typhus, hunger and other diseases.  They were not put into gas chambers although one concentration camp tried to poison them with diesel exhaust but this was not practical.  And since it takes hours to cremate one body, cremation was not used on the dead.  Auschwitz produced artificial rubber and that was what was coming out of the chimney stacks, not burning bodies.</p>

<p>Also, Stauffenberg was a pedophile, US vice-president Wallace and Robert Oppenheimer were in direct contact with Soviets, Russia was building up its troops on the border with Germany with artillery at the front, which is indicative of offensive action, so Hitler had to attack them.</p>

<p>The book is quite interesting.  I highly recommend it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to have to contradict you on that.  Their rations were only about 600 calories a day.</p>

<p>Did you know that in France, the Germans calculated the number of calories that an average person would require to live, removed a little and used that for their rations to the population.  So,  if you look at pictures of French people during the Occupation, they are all extremely thin.  This was done on purpose to punish the French, so I don&#39;t doubt they would be much harsher with the Jews.  </p>

<p>Prisoners in the camp received meals three times a day: morning, noon, and evening. Factors influencing the nutritional value of the food included the official nutritional norms in the Nazi concentration camps. In practice, Auschwitz prisoners with less physically demanding labor assignments received approximately 1,300 calories per day, while those engaged in hard labor received approximately 1,700.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you have a source that the French survived on just 600 calories a day? I mean, I had to quote the most anti-German source to show that this &#39;intentionally starving to death&#39; just wasn&#39;t done on the large scale which you imply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For this whole time, I didn&#39;t actually check which book you were implying. So I clicked your link, and now most things make more sense.</p>

<p><em>Gestapo Chief : The</em> <strong><em>1948 Interrogation</em></strong> <em>of Heinrich Muller</em></p>

<p>I believe this is from the Nuremberg trials? The information from German witnesses during this time are incredibly unreliable. German officials were tortured into confessing war crimes that they did not commit (for propaganda purposes). They later found that almost all these men had sustained permanent damage to their testicles and other areas of their body. 
The Germans had no choice but to go along with this, but ingeniously, they included deliberately erroneous/practically-impossible information that went unnoticed to the allied prosecutors at the time, but holocaust revisionists are able to pick up on today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should look into this &quot;self-government&quot; in the camps--I believe Solzhenitsyn wrote about it. Guess who ran THAT?? One guess, come on??</p>

<p>Yes, the &quot;block commandos&quot; were Jews, often beating fellow Jews, sending them to be shot, informing on them for more rations, getting GANGS of Jews to gang up on the weakest to pull out their gold teeth with spoons...smuggling weapons (hmm, why never were these used against the Germans?)</p>

<p>My Grandpop was THERE at Auschwitz...he told me that ...&quot;by FAR...the biggest enemy of any one Jew were the other Jews in the camp.&quot;</p>

<p>Solzhenitsyn confirms that there was a HUGE Jewish &quot;blaytne&quot; population in Soviet camps--they&#39;d do the stabbing and the goy would do the dying (and, of course, giving up of the 20-ruble note sewn into his jacket...) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you have to realize that there various types of prisoners in the camps - criminals, political prisoners, POWs (also depended on which country they were from), &quot;guest&quot; foreign workers (the French had to go work in Germany to replace the German men who had left to go to war, so they weren&#39;t as badly treated as the Jews, but were interned so they couldn&#39;t mingle or run away), Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, etc.  All were treated differently.</p>

<p>Buchenwald had various sections, one exclusively for the Jews.  It was those sections that flabbergasted the Americans when they liberated them.  </p>

<p>Also, people were known to come back from concentration camps if they weren&#39;t Jewish....  so I think we have to be careful here about which type of prisoner we&#39;re speaking of.</p>

<p>Yes, but they were primed to be &quot;flabbergasted&quot; by being told (incorrectly) that these were death camps.</p>

<p>I think I provided this link where US Army doctors established that this was mostly due to disease -- naturally food and medicine weren&#39;t getting through in the last weeks and months, as the German state collapsed:</p>

<p>All I was doing was asking for <strong>evidence</strong>, ideally some documents, to back this idea that 500 calories/day was the German policy for feeding Jewish camp prisoners. Clearly locking people up against their will, forcing them to work, etc, constitutes bad treatment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not my goal. I&#39;m just encouraging necessary skepticism about the often outrageous claims made against Germans during/after WWII. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a reliable source for these? Presumably you&#39;re aware many lies were told about the Germans, and it was either illegal or socially impossible to challenge them, so we need to be skeptical.</p>

<p>The official figure [i.e. mainstream history], as I&#39;d understood it, is 1300 - 1700 at Auschwitz-Birkenau, depending on how much work was done:</p>

<p>see: <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/auconditions.html">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/auconditions.html</a></p>

<p>So, yes, although the source is naturally suspect, considering their other claims, that <em>would</em> be below the 1800 I&#39;ve read is the &quot;healthy&quot; minimum. But I&#39;ve also read higher figures cited for camps. So I&#39;d be interested in your sources because I need to read more about the camp conditions.</p>

<p>Also note that after the war -- during the early years of the occupation -- German civilians were put on even less: 1200 calories / day in Berlin and Bremen, and 900 / day in Vienna (according to JFK, who visited Germany in 1945, although other sources indicate this eventually rose to a target of 1500 / day.)</p>

<p>We don&#39;t even need to bring official figures into it. You can&#39;t survive on 500-600 calories per day. The Germans would never have been able to get any work our of the prisoners, who would have just sat or lain listlessly in a kind of trance state. To be slave workers, they would have needed at least 1200 calories per day -- and even that presumes that they would have been running in part on their own stored body fat.</p>

I heard the French got about 1600 or fewer calories a day, unless they were doing manual labour.  So, I seriously doubt that&#39;s what they would have given the Jews.
I really can&#39;t remember but I&#39;ll see if I can jog my memory about the camp info.  I know it was included in a documentary about Auschwitz where they also spoke of International Red Cross making inspections there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  I was quite shocked by this revelation but it did make sense because the historically accepted reasons for Hitler&#39;s attack on Russia never made sense to me.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is the first in a series of 4 books on the same topic.  I can hardly wait to read the other three.  The reviews at Amazon are also very interesting to read.</p>

<p>Yes, a lot of people can&#39;t let go of these lies about the Evil Nazys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are all true claims:</p>

<p>Hitler DID escape to probably Spain--this was JUST on the TV news here which pissed off a LOT of AskeNAZI Jews for some reason. </p>

<p>Less than 300k Jews DID die (230kIIRC? There were no &quot;gas chambers&quot; and &quot;funeral pyres&quot;--all propaganda--the VAST, VAST majority of deaths were basically murder anyhow since they were from Typhus due to the Germans keeping unclean camps)...and yes, MANY, MANY Americans (including Prescott Bush) worked both sides. The Holocau$t is one of the largest money-making schemes in history. The Jews outdid themselves with that one. And the Germans are STILL getting <em>FLEECED!!!</em></p>

<p>Whomever this author is he is stating the FACTS (as we currently know them) and I trust them 100% RIGHT NOW just because of this...but of course I&#39;d have to read him.</p>
