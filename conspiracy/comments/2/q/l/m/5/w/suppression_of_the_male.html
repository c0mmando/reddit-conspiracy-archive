       r/conspiracy I want your opinions on this, I know most of us here are men, maybe some more than others. How much do you see males being suppressed in society? I see a huge shift to the gay movement (nothing against gay people) and a straight up feminization of the male. Not only is fluoride destroying our hormones but also it seems the assertive and aggressive males are just not there anymore. The only place I have seen true males are in the military anymore. Not only has there been a 50 year generational decline in the testosterone level.

       but also males are being born at a lesser level than females now

       You know I see it every fucking where. From the bullshit on tv, which I dont watch but get enough of it from going to friends houses and bars. too also the whole hipster skinny jean horse shit that people find hip nowadays. Now I am not against the hippy movement at all, I smoke refer just like many. The problem is though, its pervasive enough to cause a social factor that shifts our thoughts about what it is to be a MAN. Now I am just wanting your opinions on this and to see how many of you actualy give a fuck. Reason being its pissing me the fuck off. I am a dipping, drinking, loud mouth person and I cant take serious half the people I meet, especially if you are some panty waste punk that dresses like a woman. Either way my rant is over but seriously, this is not something that can continue without consequence. Your thoughts gentlemen AND ladies. I think the woman can give some insight here too.

       I think a) a whole generation of men were raised by single mothers. B) the US stopped manufacturing goods, thus the "manly arts" were lost. C) education is abysmal, but porn is prolific.

       I agree there's something to be said about US manufacturing. You buy instead of fixing. Everything is made to be replaced. My grandfather made a living wage as a radiator repairman in Chicago in the 1930s-40s. Many trades have been made obsolete.

       Parts of it are intentional, parts are not. Soy in everything and plastics in everything aren't there to intentionally function as endocrine disruptors, but it happens anyway. Porn making young males get caught in a whack off loop and lose the fire in their belly isn't really intentional beyond making money, but it happens anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military is NOT true males. A real male is a leader himself and a leader OF himself, who follows his own moral code and does not follow others' orders blindly. Soldiers are just strong trained dogs in the shape of men. When someone puts on a business suit, or prison jumpsuit, or army fatigues they shave and cut their hair for a very good reason. It turns them into high functioning dogs, not real men.

       If you think clothes, being noisy, drinking and eating tobacco is everything of what makes a man, I'd also argue that you're not completely there yet. Maybe you have the warrior, but you're missing the shaman and king archetypes with that attitude.

       I'm in the military and this cancer has spread there too. Males in the armed forces have to tread very lightly around females now. One wrong word, look, touch or anything and you will get hammered.

      <p>
       It's sad that our society has come to a point whereally the traditional sense of being a man is frowned upon. You can't be too assertive. You can't be too loud. There are too many things as men that we can't do anymore without getting shit for it.

       Its a good indication of the current climate regarding harrasment. So yes, when I see feminists regarding gradeschool level jokes between friends as harrassment, I have to question the validity of claims of harrasment.

       If I find some popular cases of male college rape. Does that mean it's a good indication that male students are generally rapists?

       So what you're saying is over-active feminists are harming your views on women.

       Are you incapable of sifting through the bullshit? What's next, do you think most women will call you a rapist if you upset them after consensual sex?

       There's a difference between appropriate legal skepticism in regards to claims of rape and treating every case as likely being a lie.

       Its a good indication that some men are rapists, just like the "few highly publicized events" are a good indication that some women will claim harrassment over almost anything.

       You made a guess that is unfounded in reality. People on trp believe that you are a failure of a man if you have to resort to beating your wife. You may not agree with what trp people believe, but to claim someone is a wife beater because they visit that sub is idiotic.

       all the alpha's are in prison i guess... that's what happens if a man asserts himself in today's society.
      </p>
      <p>
       i blame a deliberate program to promote women as equal to men. women are not equal to men, if they were: why do they have their own segregated competitions in the Olympics? in the UFC? in anything physical? mentally equal you say? actually i would say they are superior in some ways and men are superior in others. overall, with mental and physical attributes combined the men win, sorry ladies. its a man's world.
      </p>
      <p>
       next: a deliberate program to to promote homosexuality and effeminate behaviour as normal and acceptable. but most of all i blame the the hormone bending chemicals in our food, its packaging and the water we drink. thanks also to "the pill" etc not being filtered out by water treatment plants designed and built 100 years ago.

       The poster is right to question, though. Why should we accept your view of "true males?" Where do all the other males fit? And if we still have "true males" in the military, then could it be that the societal view of masculine behavior is expanding rather than that masculine men are under attack. Personally, I view the behavior you seem to suggest indicates manliness ("a dipping, drinking, loud mouth person", conveniently traits you possess) as boorish and crude. I won't deny that marketers (like Carl's Jr.) love having male self-image predicated on such ridiculous standards, but I abhor the thought that large populations of men yearn for the day when the characterization in the commercial below is the standard:

       Oh because its in now to be in touch with your feminine. Yea that feminism is sure working its magic. Also I am not hating on shit, you wanna be a pussy then be one. Problem is its not allowed in society to express the male nature, without the female crap sprinkled in. Shit I have seen women more masculine then some males. Its a hormonal problem at its core but no its too unmanly to talk about how men are being feminized in society. You know buck up, deal with it. Never address whats really going on..

       ...or maybe you have some weird delusion that all men were only one certain way all throughout a history that you never lived in.  If you think that until recently all men dressed and acted only one specific way than you are being delusional - willful or otherwise.  All of the advances we have in society, all the technological breakthroughs, the medical breakthroughs, and the quality of life advancements didn't come from your typical "military guy".  They came from inquisitive minds that refused to accept what was deemed impossible.  If you want to see society improve then maybe we need real education and questioning of values, not just more "macho" guys who want to fight and kill shit.  It actually makes you look pretty stupid to call that guy a pussy because he said that everybody is able to have their own views on what being a man is....sounds like you are just one of those violent type assholes who try to fight people who disagree with them and don't stroke your ego.  He didn't even say anything offensive or aggressive in any way

       I think it's mainly matriarchal vs patriarchal cultures at play. Example: US and Europe being matriarchal. Russia and China being patriarchal. What does that mean? Well, in short, matriarchal is about hedonism and permissiveness, consumerism (if you will) vs patriarchal that is about discipline, tradition, conservatism. I haven't given it too much thought but it's division of values. Think about what, generally speaking, women want and what men want. If I recall correctly, Robert Anton Wilson has touched upon this in one of his books. So the thing is. We live in a matriarchal society, it's about consumerism, liberalism, permission, excess, sex, ultrafeminism (note: not equality), passivity, hedonism, etc. List goes on. All of the above keep our society going, there is a reason that marketing industry tailors women as the main income of revenue. For extreme comparison, cultures that implement Sharia law, have tried to subdue these things, they want to preserve dominance of patriarchal values. In US and Western Europe, consumerism is the driving force of economy, thus matriarchal values are dominant. If you look at the statistic, US went from patriarchal to matriarchal values and actively propose it further. I am sure you've felt it or have seen it. Is it bad or good? Well, RAW proposed that societies in a constant state of flux between the two. Let's say we are happened to be in matriarchal state in our country. I tell you what, my sister and mother told me straight up one day, that it's easier to be a woman in this country (US) and we come from patriarchal country. Take it as you will, I haven't really explored this topic in much depth.

       So a few highly publicised events are representative of the whole.

      <p>
       If I find some popular cases of male college rape. Does that mean it's a good indication that male students are generally rapists?

        when I see feminists regarding gradeschool level jokes between friends as harrassment, I have to question the validity of claims of harrasment.

      <p>
       So what you're saying is over-active feminists are harming your views on women.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you incapable of sifting through the bullshit? What's next, do you think most women will call you a rapist if you upset them after consensual sex?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No, but it makes me question the current feminist line of thinking that we should never, ever, ever question the validity of an alleged victims claims.

      <p>
       There's a difference between appropriate legal skepticism in regards to claims of rape and treating every case as likely being a lie.

       <p>
        Thats nice, but you made a claim about wife beating. Find me one single upvoted post on that subreddit that advocates that.

       I made a

       , not a claim, about that users personal views based on  their comment and their subscription to TRP.

       I agree there's something to be said about US manufacturing. You buy instead of fixing. Everything is made to be replaced. My grandfather made a living wage as a radiator repairman in Chicago in the 1930s-40s. Many trades have been made obsolete.
