        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been observing how, prior to these two police officers being shot in their car, the police were the aggressors who choked a black man to death.  The protests, the public outrage, and everything that came along with it.</p>

<p>Now, after the 2 police were shot, tens of thousands of police are flocking to NY to pay their respects, and the entire NYPD are being hailed as hero&#39;s with a tough day to day job that is more difficult than most of us would ever understand.  </p>

<p>I really feel like this was the perfect way to shift public sentiment towards the police and it has helped their cause immensely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I can totally see it. They find this guy who has been posting all kinds of anti-cop stuff because they&#39;re in bed with the NSA. Maybe they go to his place with agents and hold a gun on his gf and threaten him, &quot;if you don&#39;t do this, we&#39;ll kill her, if you do, we&#39;ll see to it you don&#39;t get caught&quot; or something. He does it. The agent kills the gf anyway. I mean, I get it. These people are psychos. I&#39;m not ruling it out. I just haven&#39;t seen enough evidence to convince me yet, but the timing is so damn perfect if you are the police and NYC government.</p>

Just when the protest movement against police brutality and militarization was getting a serious national foothold and support along with MSM coverage...then it all comes to an end because police are such heroes and they have families and stuff you know..so tragic a lone gunman kills those 2 <em>minority</em> cops.

    <div class="md"><p>A couple days after the event I went to the NYPD website in hopes of finding a list of employees...never did. I also did a google search of the two victims names hoping to figure out some basic info about them. Didn&#39;t really find anything (well, there was a different guy with the same name who lives in Newtown, CT of all places, but I think that&#39;s really just a coincidence).</p>

<p>But I never really found out much about the two guys personal lives. Not that that&#39;s important in the context of a supposed cop killing, but the media is usually overflowing with stories like  that. It&#39;s been a few days now, so I&#39;ll do that again and edit this with the results.</p>

<p>The only other thing that&#39;s odd to me about all of this is, I keep hearing  he murdered them execution style, I&#39;m not even sure what that means, but how does one go about accomplishing that with two armed cops in the middle of an anti-terror drill full of cops? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess if that&#39;s the case it shouldn&#39;t be too hard for me to find a ton of examples of that photo ID style on google?
EDIT: Been doing some basic google image searches and the most common one I see is like this: <a href="https://communitycop.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/amd_ziegler1.jpg">https://communitycop.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/amd_ziegler1.jpg</a>
EDIT 2: So I found exactly 2 pictures of 2 different officers with the green screen. So, it looks like that is one style of photo the NYPD takes, but it&#39;s hardly the only one on file, or even the one they use most often with the media. In fact, the kind they use most often is the style I posted above. It just seems strange to me, in such a high profile story, we&#39;re only getting the shitty academy version of their photos when they should have much nicer, higher quality photos of these two guys</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more I dig, the more it looks like this is all to subvert our society, not increase support for the police and authority.  It looks more like key positions have been infiltrated to turn America upside down and subvert it, as in a method of national subversion and demoralization. The push is NOT to create a massive power structure, but to sow seeds of discontent and revolution against civil society.  The perceived enemy (e.g. authority) is not the problem, it is the elements that have &quot;infected&quot; the positions of authority.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2qjnyz/thousands_of_cops_turn_their_backs_as_mayor_de/cn6x4pv">This poster is claiming that NYPD brass ordered him to turn his back.</a></p>

<p>Also, G. Edward Griffin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnf0I2dQ0i0">interviewed a former Russian spy</a> who described a process of demoralization.  That&#39;s not to say Russia is our enemy, but rather former elements in Russia, and now in the U.S. are working, not to enslave, but rather to foster chaos, war, and general disharmony.  </p>

<p>If this is true, then the NSA spying is possibly an attempt to identify these elements, and the CIA infighting that took place during Carter and Reagan were against the current &quot;Neo-Conservatives&quot; currently in charge of foreign policy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t help but notice the names of the 2 cops killed...both minorities, not at all your typical cop. I doubt either is a legacy. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a conspiracy, could just be a sad coincidence. I&#39;d be interested to hear from family members, were these guys treated like one of the gang by their fellow cops? Or were they shunned a bit by the &#39;regulars&#39;? And they were partnered together you say? Interesting. Not proof of anything, just interesting..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is how every single NYPD officers ID picture looks. They stand in front of a green background when in the academy. Before being issued collar brass (indicates their precient), or a badge, as they are not done with the academy yet.  Nothing telling about that. Also there is video of the scene before EMS shows up.

    <div class="md"><p>It probably wasn&#39;t a false flag, there are plenty of people around who want to kill police. The vast majority of protestors are against this sort of thing because obviously they are not homicidal maniacs who want to take out random people just because they happen to be wearing a uniform. It is however being used to polarize opinions and give the police brutality apologists a cause to gather together around. Its surreal to see the KKK, a large number of serving police officers, and self-described &#39;honest,decent Americans&#39; gather togather to denounce the entire black race as  &#39;sub-human nigger animals&#39; and anyone who objects to unlawful violence by the police as &#39;nigger-loving commie scum who deserve to be tortured and killed&#39;. The fact that the vast majority of people who object to police brutality also object to brutality towards police is conveniently ignored, and the ones who don&#39;t are encouraged to spout their mindless hatred of the police only for their stupidity to be used as an example of all protestors views. The slain officers in this case were innocent victims of a weak-minded asshole (with easy access to firearms) and are as much victims of this situation as any of the victims of the police. That propaganda machine smoothly rolled into action as soon as the protests started getting attention, and events like this are eagerly incorporated into the viewpoint that wants people controlled and docile. If you&#39;d like to see examples of what I&#39;m talking about, follow the #blacklivesmatter hashtag on twitter for a few days. You&#39;ll easily be able to see many hidden agendas being played out on the easily influenced masses.</p>
