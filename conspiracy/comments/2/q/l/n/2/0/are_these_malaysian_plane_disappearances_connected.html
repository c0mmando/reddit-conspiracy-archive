       MH370 disappears mysteriously over ocean, MH17 explodes over russia, and now the Air Asia disappearance. 3 Malaysian planes, all disappearing suddenly mid flight. Whats going on here, is it dumb luck or something more?

       Indonesia and Malaysia have appallingly bad weather around this time of year and flights to Singapore from Asian cities are ridiculously common. If you search for the satellite, the last known location of the plane was in a squall of red to black rainfall  (ie. the heaviest).

       Modern airlines don't just crash because of bad weather at cruise altitude. There's no reason they would ever fly into bad enough storms to crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       That air france flight crashed in a storm but that's because the pilots were idiots and couldn't do basic stall recovery.

       You're dumb. Of course planes just crash. One fright from Korea to the US needed to make an emergency landing in japan due to bad weather. The plane requested to fly higher before losing contact, meaning they were having difficulty flying. Don't ask a question then downvote and disagree with a completely rational answer, especially when you don't understand planes or weather conditions.

       But also should not be an immediate (nor sole) conclusion jumped to considering this was not a novice pilot. He had over 6,000 flight hours under his belt and this airliner has quite a good track record otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there is a first time for everything but surely that's not the only reasoning possible for the flight's disappearance. If MH370 has taught us anything, there are mysterious forces at work.

       Sigh the only thing I can think is this is distraction for the last failed distraction. There was an attempt to blame North Korea in the sony hack but that shit fell completely thru. American public couldn't careless and just wanted to watch a movie so no big deal. Now disappear another plane for another distraction into the new year. Remember Ebola, and ISIS?

       Considering el-cheapo airlines has a pretty damn good track record and pilots with thousands of hours of flight time under their belt... I wouldn't jump to that conclusion.

       And that kind of weather is not uncommon in this region. Hardly this pilot's first rodeo in bad weather.

       I am not entirely sure. Since MH370, I really find it difficult to just assume a completely missing aircraft to be some kind of "pilot error" or "pilot suicide". That's just too convenient of an excuse.

       There were 3 flights.
Numbers 370, 17 and 8501. When we add it all together we get 8888. It's 8 repeated 4 times. 8 - 4 is 4.
       <br/>
       When we times that by 2222, we get 8888. Coincidence? 2,2,2,2 and 4 all put together is 12.  We divide that by the letters in Asia which is 4.
       <br/>
       We get 3.

       but wait. There is more.
       <br/>
       The 3rd flight disappeared between Indonesia (9 letters) and Singapore(9 letters).
       <br/>
       The 2nd flight crashed in Russia (6 letters).
       <br/>
       The first disappeared in the ocean (5 letters).
       <br/>
       9+9+6+5 = 29. 29 divided by 4 is 7.25, we divide 7.25 by the number of flights that went missing. We get 2 and a half.

       How's this for a connection. We are watching the final phase of an operation that's been going on for many months. The Malaysian flight was a test. Think of it as a dry run to establish stealing an airliner and then making it show up somewhere else without the US intelligence community realizing it had ever happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have another flight from the same region that seems to have disappeared. This time the media may even present a convincing story that the crash site has been located. But the real plane itself will show up somewhere else in the coming weeks or months.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that time, it will appear as a regular flight in someone's air traffic control system. It's not unreasonably to be concerned that a nuke might be on board. If something happens after that, everyone's attention will be focused on North Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some really nasty people might be able to pull off a very dirty trick. If they are as smart as I think they are, they'll be the last people in the world that anyone would suspect. Because that's the way it always happens.

       Frightening theory, but it is very possible. The hijacking theories didn't have much merit in my opinion when it was a single plane. Now that more than one from the same region has officially been marked as "missing," the hijacking theory becomes much more credible. Add to that the constant reminders in the MSM as of late that nuclear weapons could be used on the US...

       There's no more or less reason to assume an Airbus can be "remote hijacked" - they are all reliant on fly-by-wire computer abstracted control. If such a thing is possible at all (dubious to say the least) then it would be possible with either Airbus or Boeing aircraft given the right preparation and resources.

       That's not an especially accurate history of Airbus really. EADS was the result of a much later merger between shareholders. Airbus has very little history in military development, having only released a few military transport aircraft.

       I placed this in another sub,  so here it is (my two cents and contribution to the conspiracy)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         In February 2014, the UN released the human rights report about conditions in North Korea. The North labeled it as an attack on the government... A month later, MH370 disappeared.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         With the released of The Interview, and the denial of service attack on the North Korean Internet, the North is crying again.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Both Malaysia and Indonesia have working North Korean embassies in their countries. And both are within flying distance to the NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying that NK is responsible but two "major events" involving that country were subsequently followed by a disappearance of an airliner in that geographic area.
      </p>
      <p>
       But...
Maybe making planes disappear is a way for the NK to to throw a temper tantrum.

       There isn't any connection. MH370's disappearance may of been caused by a number of events, but it is presumed lost somewhere in the Indian ocean. MH17 was clearly shot down by pro-Russian separatists whom believed it was a Ukrainian military cargo plane, but realized their mistake afterwards. This recent flight disappearance was most likely because of bad weather. There is no conspiracy going on here and it was all just coincidence that three planes have been lost in one year.

       I'd bring sources, but I have so many other comment boards to shill on that I just don't have the time to fish up the web articles for you on it. Even if I did the moment you saw a .gov website you'd claim that I'm just some lowlife sleep deprived shill working within the bowels of the Pentagon trying to "disrupt the top minds". I'm just trying to do what I can before I got banned for being "off topic."

       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       MH 17:
       <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/07/20/the-evidence-that-may-prove-pro-russian-separatists-shot-down-mh17/">
        Here is the best summary
       </a>
       on who's to blame for the plane's demise. It comes from the unreputable rag known as the
       <em>
        Washington Post
       </em>
       . I know you won't believe anything from the "mainstream media", so I just can't win on this one no matter how much evidence is put before you. Anyways,
       <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30064374">
        here is the transcript
       </a>
       of pro-Russian sepratists on the ground discovering that the plane they shot down was not a Ukrainian cargo plane as they first suspected, but rather a civilian plane. But hey, can you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       believe anything from the BBC?
      </p>
      <p>
       MH370: You know what, I can't find the energy in me to restate everything the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370">
        Wikipedia article can
       </a>
       . I can't put it in better words than they have. Go use your "virtue of free thinking" and poke around those citations at the bottom and see a different side to this than what you've read on InfoWars.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for AirAsia flight QZ8501, information is still coming in,
       <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30614627">
        but it looks like
       </a>
       it was lost to bad weather. (Sorry about using the BBC as a news source; I forgot that they're owned by the Jews or Bill Gates or something like that.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe not every major and devastating event that happens is also a conspiracy.
       <em>
        But hey, I'm just asking questions here.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, may we remember all the lives that have been lost in these recent tragedies. 239 souls aboard MH370, 298 lives lost aboard MH17, and now 162 more missing on QZ8501. Flight has not come without risk, which just seems all too evident recently...

       "Taking the piss" or not, what they typed is correct. These planes are not being secreted away in some hidden location to be used later. Shit happens and planes crash. There is
       <strong>
        zero
       </strong>
       evidence of anything nefarious about these missing airliners. If you have proof otherwise, present it. You can't because it doesn't exist and If you believe otherwise you are a fool. Believing in this nonsense is nothing but a distraction from real conspiracies that are actually occurring.

       The fact that the first one disappeared without a trace is nerarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       That the second one from the same airline was shot down months later is a coincidence unlike any we have seen in aviation history. There is evidence this aircraft was shot down by Ukraine, which means it possibly had a US hand in it, which means the aircraft may have been selected.
      </p>
      <p>
       If just one of these accidents happened we would leave it be. Three in a short space of time is so incredibly unlikely that it is worth investigation.

       From your source:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Ukraine released what it said was audio from phone calls between rebels and Russian officers
        </strong>
        after the downing of Malaysia Airlines 17. In one call, a rebel says, “We have just shot down a plane.”

      <p>
       So where did that audio come from again? The only other possible suspect? Doesn't seem suspicious to you? What does the Black Box say? Who has it? Maybe that's where your investigation should start, rather than take some random audio released by the only other suspect.

       How's this for a connection. We are watching the final phase of an operation that's been going on for many months. The Malaysian flight was a test. Think of it as a dry run to establish stealing an airliner and then making it show up somewhere else without the US intelligence community realizing it had ever happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have another flight from the same region that seems to have disappeared. This time the media may even present a convincing story that the crash site has been located. But the real plane itself will show up somewhere else in the coming weeks or months.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that time, it will appear as a regular flight in someone's air traffic control system. It's not unreasonably to be concerned that a nuke might be on board. If something happens after that, everyone's attention will be focused on North Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some really nasty people might be able to pull off a very dirty trick. If they are as smart as I think they are, they'll be the last people in the world that anyone would suspect. Because that's the way it always happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       How's that for a theory?

       But also should not be an immediate (nor sole) conclusion jumped to considering this was not a novice pilot. He had over 6,000 flight hours under his belt and this airliner has quite a good track record otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there is a first time for everything but surely that's not the only reasoning possible for the flight's disappearance. If MH370 has taught us anything, there are mysterious forces at work.

       I've been reading about the missing airliners for days now thinking there's no way this was all just coincidental. But you know that, you might be right. They might just be
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       bad at this.
