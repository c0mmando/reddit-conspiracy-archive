       I, like you, find it
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       sketchy that no camera footage has been released.  and even more sketchy is that I've read the US gov says ALL camera malfunctioned. (or something like that?).  I'm with you there.  That is total bullshit and we should all press the government for answers on this.  But here are my two pressing questions....If a plane did not hit the pentagon, what did?  and where is flight 77?

       Personally, I think the footage has been deliberately suppressed because it's propaganda gold; you would definitely see excerpts appear in ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Taliban and more general anti-US propaganda productions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure footage does exist in some classified archive and I don't accept that the entire surveillance system malfunctioned.  Far too convenient and far too important a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody appears to have filmed the actual fly-over or impact with a handheld camcorder or similar, as it's not really a tourist area and nobody would think to do so (unlike Manhattan which is crawling with tourists).  In the case of New York that cat was never in the bag.

       DC is crawling with tourists. There a many notable monuments that people love to take pictures of or film. Have you ever visited DC? Sure its no Orlando or NYC but unlike most cities in America in 2001 DC was teeming with security cameras.

       You do realize that it's right on the border right? And an airplane can be seen from miles around.

       Added on: Look how close it is to the White House, the Lincoln memorial, and not to mention the national mall, but clearly people like you aren't concerned with the facts now are you.

       Perhaps, to some observers the MSM and others in Power, have indeed

       footage necessary to do a complete investigation of the

       that had often
       <em>

       from strategic locations (For Good Morning New York...)  had
       <em>
        no feed
       </em>
       that morning, countless helicopters both Police and News in the air failed, also the footage that did air, lost all the background of the
       <em>
        skyline
       </em>
       on a clear bright blue sky day, long before smoke obstructed other video footage shot by ordinary citizens from various vantage points.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Naudet Film of 9/11 is alleged proof, for many of the first plane. I'm personally not convinced that what they claim to have filmed is actually what struck the first tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second
       <em>
        plane
       </em>
       should have had Video, Photo shots up the wazoo...

      <p>
       No plane hit WTC7. Correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       No plane hit WTC6. Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC6 has a crater in the middle of it! Fucker didn't fall down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out 4 &amp; 5 as well because these buildings were severely deformed and didn't fall down.

       I was just replying to his theory that they suppressed footage of planes flying into US buildings in order to stop foreign propaganda. My question was to him, if they needed to have no footage to get out, then why wouldn't they suppress ALL footage of planes hitting American buildings?

       I'm on a mobile, so can't dig for stuff on my POS phone, but I believe it was a tomahawk cruise missile. There were side-by-side comparison photos of his mansion and the pentagon available online years ago, but haven't checked since around 2006-7 IIRC.

       Ahh. Well that could be a submarine or land-based launch site anywhere on the northeast coast. I'm on the west coast, so I'm not worth much on specifics on the east coast. I've found launch sites at the beach out here, though. Just a giant hinged manhole cover in a little valley, fenced off with "do not enter", etc. 9/11 was carried out during multiple military drills, so a "simulated" launch would not be very suspect.

       got it.  So in order for that to happen you believe an entire chain of command from the president, to joint chiefs, to generals, down to the chief petty officer who hit the launch button all agreed to fire a missile at the heart of our military center, deliberately killing fellow co-workers?

       Not really. I don't think bush would have anything to do with it directly. Cheney and Rumsfeld and all the DOD neocons? Sure. If running a response simulation, you follow protocol. If the reponse simulation is all fucked up (as it was on 9/11) then all bets are off. A pentagon strike on 9/11 would be similar to setting a building on fire and robbing the bank across the street. But in this case, they got rid of a shitload of budgeting paperwork that could potentially destroy the presidency and have huge implications for US military power across the world. Pointing out lives lost has no weight when discussing warmongers. It's just not relevant.

       He was on the exact opposite side of the building. What makes this whole plane theory even more ridiculous is the way the plane apparently descended and eventually hit the pentagon. If a hijacker wanted effect maximum damage he would of hit the roof which was a much much bigger target then that tiny section that was damaged. Experienced pilots with thousands of hours in flight time said that hitting where that plane hit was borderline impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The locations of the different offices around the pentagon are public knowledge and if a would be terrorist wanted to inflict maximum damage they would've hit where the joint chefs offices are.

       In the fog of war, nothing goes as planned. To think rummy gave the ok to shoot a missile at the building he knew he'd be in, I'd say you're insane. Furthermore, like others have stated, the flight path taken involved some crazy menuvers.  It's likely he didn't hit his intended spot

       I'm not going to dwell on how RIDICULOUS it is to believe that any pilot flying the equivalent of a 18 wheeler could performs those maneuvers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The damage should've had wings and engine  holes because those are by far the strongest part of the plane. The haul of the plane could never had caused that kind of damage I don't care how you look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: when you fire a missile you know where it's going to hit to a degree of certainty that if you are on the other side of a large heavily reinforced building you know you'll be completely fine.

       Questions we would all love the answer to.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at a lot of events, all we know is that the official story doesn't add up. When things happen for real, it is obvious. If Bin Laden was behind 9/11, you can bet he would have released a high definition victory speech video letting the world know of his greatest success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we have that? No. We have video of him denying the attack. Then we have grainy, potato quality video of someone who looks nothing like Bin Laden, yet we are told
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       Bin Laden, claiming responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authorities would have released video of all the hijackers at airports. Do we have that? No. We have many of the supposed hijackers turning up still alive around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't pretend to have all the answers, but that doesn't change the fact that the official story
       <em>
        doesn't add up
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The cab driver outside the pentagon admits he is part of a 'rich peoples plan' that he didnt want to be a part of. But he's stuck in it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       How they do these things while keeping most people quiet is a mystery to me. I think the CIA hypnosis and mind control program is a part of it- look up MK Ultra and project Open Eyes. And yes, we have official documents that these projects exist. They receive millions of dollars of funding, so mind control is not some crazy thing paranoid conspiracy theorists just came up with. If the CIA takes it seriously, you better take it seriously.

       Andrews air force base is really close to the pentagon. I'm not saying it came from there but when missiles are fired it's not like everyone is made aware of it. It might not have even been a missile but a bomb why do you think all private footage of the event was confiscated almost immediately and never released?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know where 70 people went they could've easily never been real people to begin with. It's so easy to make up a fake profile and back story. If there was a plane it could've been brought down else where. I don't know but what I do know is that no plane was involved in that event.

       Well, the pentagon is his office building. You sure give a lot of moral credit to men who profit from death. I've answered plenty of your questions, and you failed to answer my one question. I'm done assuming you seek knowledge, and I'll just assume you buy the official story at this point. Happy holidays!

       The were dozens of witnesses to the plane hitting the Pentagon. It flew right over one of the busiest freeways in America during a busy time of the day. There are many photos of plane wreckage available online.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a plane didn't hit the Pentagon, someone went through a ton of trouble (planting over a hundred people on a freeway at the perfect time, immediately getting a team into the Pentagon to plant plane parts, etc) to make it look like a plane.

       I watched some interviews with those witnesses, and the flight path they describe is incompatible with a path that would have hit the Pentagon.

       A missle hit the pentagon. Flight 77, and this is why it's called a theory, never existed. Everything was forged by the government. They may have been real people, but those people are either paid off or in WP.

       WP = witness protection. My own two cents begins with the fact that the pentagon is the most protected building in the world in the most restricted and protected airspace in the world. Not to mention the pentagon was hit well after the twin towers and would have had more than enough time to prevent a plane from hitting it. Not to mention Andrews air force base is right outside of DC and it would've taken a jet fighter minutes to reach DC airspace.

       Well 70 is a really small number. There a about 360 million Americans as of the last census. I do not know how many people are in witness protection but I'm going to take a guess and it's well over 70.
      </p>
      <p>
       With out asking where the plane went you have to look at the logistics. On a airplane the weakest and lightest part is the haul aka where you sit. The heaviest and strongest parts are the wings and engine. The official narrative makes the assertion that a weak airplane haul smashed through layers of reinforced concrete and metal while the wings and engine didn't even make it through the outer wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did the plane go? Where did those people go? I don't know, but I do know around 100,000 kids are kidnapped without a trace each year. It's a big country and if you know the right techniques you can make a measly 70 people disappear that is if such a plane ever existed.

       Well, the conspiracy theorist in me says anything is possible. And I don't think it was done willingly. I think they had a choice. Do this or you and your family will be dead and erased from existence...because we are the government.

       No, i do not think the us government is capable of firing a missile into their own headquarters while at the same time make 70 random Americans disappear from an airplane. (Not the mention kill 1000s of other Americans in nyc). If that makes me naive,  so be it. I've worked closely with many in the intelligence community. Life in there isn't as secret as you think.  If Cheney and Co were behind 9/11, it would have gotten out.  If you don't believe that,  trust me, you are the naive one.

       so do you actually believe a plane hit it? funny how those engines always seem to be there for the photo ops of every air crash ever, yet those ones supposedly disintegrated on impact.....
that or the pentagon has some sort of magic disintegrating power shield around it.
its shows how much the average american knows about physics if any of them buy that a massive airliner crashing at 400 mph left no debris or burning fuel and all the damage afterwards was a hole the size of an 18 wheeler

       that looks like some ones blog and again most of the bits were able to fit in buckets? ffs what happened to the massive car sized engines that would have been 10-15 ft further out to the side of that minuscule hole. those engines can not possibly disintegrate on impact.

       okay so here is where it falls apart 530 mph iirc is beyond the max speed those planes are even capable of with out ripping the wings off and thats ignoring the sheer forces that are going to be buffeting those wings at that height. if it were an airliner the Fuel burning off would have torched the whole god damn pentagon 
for example. 
 for whatever reason youtube and google are down where i am (wtf) ill link a video of a 757 crashing (or hell any real airliner) which makes the claim that it was a plane absolutely ridiculous

       okay so the top speed of an aircraft is while at cruising altitude the closer they are to the ground the thicker the air and the higher the resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       609 is nearly the speed of sound at sealevel and that would tear the wings clear off if it could even reach that speed in the thicker air
      </p>
      <p>
       and the link for fire requires a login im not saying there wasn't fire im saying if it was an actual airliner the fire ball would have been nearly the size of the pentagon (yes i know how big it is) the planes were nearly full having just taken off in most cases (not sure about 77)
      </p>
      <p>
       how could the planes that hit the buildings have enough fuel that burns a 900 ish degrees to melts steel ( melting point 1700 degrees) yet the one that smashed in to the pentagon had barely enough to singe the exterior of the building?

      <p>
       I was simply pointing out to you that you were wrong about the top speed of the aircraft.  as I said, according to  wiki (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77
       </a>
       ) the plane was going 535mph at impact.  The speed of sound is 761mph.  so not only are you wrong on many fronts, you arent really making a point.

      <p>
       are you serious? The crash and subsequent fire penetrated three outer ring sections of the western side. The outermost ring section was largely destroyed, and a large section collapsed.  thats a little more than "singeing the exterior".
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like we arent even discussing the same incident.

      <p>
       in the strictest sense, you raise a good point, they pyramids may not. I would assume the retort would be that there doesn't seem to be any significant impact in believing or otherwise in the pyramids. Those who believe flight 77 never existed however would possibly suggest that the pentagon being attacked served a wider purpose of augmenting the industrial military complex and laid ground work for 10-20 years of Middle eastern war.

       But with a airplane. It's the same thing. All we have is a one sided argument that it was there

       I'm not google. Use your intelligence and do some research if you truly would like a better idea than the official story.

       No, i do not think the us government is capable of firing a missile into their own headquarters while at the same time make 70 random Americans disappear from an airplane. (Not the mention kill 1000s of other Americans in nyc). If that makes me naive,  so be it. I've worked closely with many in the intelligence community. Life in there isn't as secret as you think.  If Cheney and Co were behind 9/11, it would have gotten out.  If you don't believe that,  trust me, you are the naive one.
