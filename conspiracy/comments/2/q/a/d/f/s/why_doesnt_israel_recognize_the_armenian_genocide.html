       Here's a mod's "explanation":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This submission has been removed because it involves current events. To keep from discussion of politics, we have a 20-year rule here. You may want to try
        <a href="/r/ask_politics">
         /r/ask_politics
        </a>
        or another current-events focused sub.
       </p>
       <p>
        While yes, the genocide itself is nearly 100 years old, the reasons for this are more seated in modern politics.

       As stated in another thread,
       <a href="/r/AskHistorians">
        /r/AskHistorians
       </a>
       has incredibly strict rules and probably delete more threads and comments than are allowed. As to why your thread got deleted, it's because it was about Israels recognition of the Genocide in
       <em>
        the present
       </em>
       and not about the Genocide itself. That's clearly a political question, not a historical one.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to answer the question itself, because Turkey. Along with Jordan, Turkey is one of the few allies that Israel has in the region. A public government recognition of the genocide would sour relationships. That being said, there's a sizable Armenian population in Israel. One part of the Old City of Jerusalem is called "The Armenian Quarter" and is home to many Armenian restaurants, churches and cultural centers. There are Armenian Genocide remembrance days, Armenian Genocide museums, it's taught in public schools and speeches in Israeli academic institutions about the it. Still, it's pretty disgusting that the Knesset kowtows to Erdogan on this issue.

       Sorry, but that is bullshit, and you know it. Iran previously had good relations with Germany - would Israel (or you) accept Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's refusal to acknowledge the Holocaust because he feared doing so would "sour relations" with Germany?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course not.

      <p>
       Erdogan didn't enter office until 2003 - the Armenian Genocide began in 1915... did Israel acknowledge the genocide prior to Erdogan entering office?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, there are other reasons that the Zionist State refuses to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide.

       But more on that later...

       Well by bringing in what Israel is up to now, is bringing up current events.
      </p>
      <p>
       A better way to bring this up would be to word the post as what was the Armenian Genocide or something along those lines.

       It's clear that the rules in that sub (as well as many others) are mostly arbitrary and selectively enforced.  They're worded in such a way that almost any post can be removed for a rule violation if the mods decide it needs to go for whatever reason.  This seems to be one of the most effective tools for content manipulation on reddit as it allows blatant censorship to occur under the guise of "strict moderation".
