<p>I put <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2pc916/listen_to_this/"><strong>this</strong></a> OP up a bit over a week ago when I first started listening to the individual in question.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bllnm-2eVRQ">This talk right here</a> is another interview of him that is over <em>five hours long</em>.  In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/groundzeromedia/2014-07-02"><strong>this</strong></a> interview, he not only says he&#39;ll take a lie detector test to prove his honesty, but that he&#39;d be willing to take the test while having <em>sodium pentothal administered to him</em>.</p>

<p>In and of itself, the information is no more &quot;crazy&quot; or bizarre or &quot;out there&quot; than any other story your average run of the mill hoaxer would conjure up.  However, the fact that he starts every interview by saying that he&#39;s a member of the United States military means that he would indeed be committing a felony - risking getting locked up in prison for a few years <em>and</em> fined a few tens of thousands of dollars on top of that - if he in fact is <em>not</em> a military officer.  That shows that he&#39;d be going WAAAAY (and unnecessarily) out of his way to perpetrate a hoax if that is indeed all he&#39;s doing.  Therefore, and as such, it doesn&#39;t really stand up to reason - to real critical inquiry - to just out and out say that he&#39;s just doing nothing but making all this up in interview after interview for dozens upon dozens of hours...just to be a troll.</p>

<p>Not only that, but to add that he&#39;s as willing as he is to have sodium pentathol administered to him <em>while</em> taking a lie detector test?  The &quot;he&#39;s just making shit up.&quot; argument doesn&#39;t add up taking all these factors into consideration.  The dude is <em>not</em> afraid of going out of his way to show that he&#39;s not lying and is telling the truth.</p>

<p><em>Very</em> interesting stuff to say the least.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas, sir.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, interesting.  I remember your OP from a week or two ago and I had already bookmarked one of the videos you&#39;d mentioned.  The main thing is just the time constraint of how long the videos are, I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading in my free time.  This sounds like something worth exploring though as I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t be spending so much of your time on it otherwise.  Thanks for the response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  I&#39;ve come across various cases in the past that, after a bit more in depth examination, gave the definite impression that they were hoaxes or lying or absolutely not cracked up to what they were claiming.  Stan Romanek&#39;s and Jonathan Reed&#39;s hoaxes come very definitely to mind here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4LJLrRaGCE">Andrew Basiago&#39;s</a> testimony definitely does <em>not</em> fit this classification, however.  His information is not ultimately very easy to discount given who he is and what he stands to lose if he&#39;s perpetrating a hoax.  Harvard-educated professor of psychiatry <em>at</em> Harvard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=john+mack">Dr. John Mack</a> definitely was no hoaxer either, and the investigations and studies he was undertaking and publishing were such that I wouldn&#39;t be surprised in the least if they were the reason why he had an &quot;unfortunate accident&quot; and was killed in a car crash a few years ago.</p>

<p>And Mr. Randy Cramer is one I find who is also of this ilk.  I shall continue investigating and critically examining what he says, but he has not come across as a hoax perpetrator up to this point in the least.</p>

<p>Cheers, and have a great day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Thinking outside the box&quot; For over a year, this phrase has been poking at me. It dawned to me how wrong the application to the phrase is. It&#39;s no longer enough to think outside the box. The problems are all inside the box and removing oneself outside of it, one can no longer see the problem for what it is.</p>

<p>For example, look at our justice system. Crimes are still being committed yet our justice system continues to leave crime unresolved. Increasing policing and punishment does not work but here we are, still using those same tactics. There is a failure to look at the root cause of crime. By thinking inside the box, we can  find the source of the dilemma.</p>

No mod or group of mods can possibly determine a priori whether a line of reasoning will pan out. Letting the users decide, and research any claims themselves, even seemingly absurd ones, allows us to consider avenues we may not have. I would have left reddit long ago if not for this and few other subs.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I love this sub for the same reason, in spite of the constant annoyances...</p>

<ul>
<li>front page with multiple posts on same topic</li>
<li>misleading titles</li>
<li>trolls</li>
<li>poor sourcemanship</li>
<li>agenda obsessed</li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise, I&#39;ve only been wrong 1% of my time here, but it&#39;s okay because I&#39;ve forgiven myself for that already, and I hope you will too, as I forgive you, fellow skeptics. Naturally, I&#39;m doubtful that things will improve, but I&#39;m willing to pretend for a little while, in the spirit of the perpetuaon of a wonderful idea...critical thinking.</p>

<p>That said, thank you kindly for the post, and good vibes back at ya!</p>

<p>Peace out.</p>

<p>All too often, I think that this sub conflates critical thinking with wild speculation. Anything that hits the news is either a false flag or an inside job. Every use of force is an internationally promoted action. Every gathering of 3 or more people is a vast web of conspiracy.</p>

<p>The problem with this &quot;critical thinking&quot; is that it masks actual, dangerous conspiracies that aren&#39;t hidden at all. The complicity of prosecutors and law enforcement; the prison industrial complex; the gentlemen&#39;s agreement not to prosecute financial firms...  when we mushroom these out into vast conspiracies rather than accept them as networks of individuals who act for their own gain, we actually damage our ability to see the problem and the incentives that promote it.</p>

<p>Most urgently, the notion that everything everywhere is under some conspiracy&#39;s thumb leads to lack of engagement. People don&#39;t seek to build, only to tear down. Voting is seen as pointless. Reform isn&#39;t taken seriously.</p>

<p>These are all too often preludes to a society that is far worse than the one in which we live. Think the police are bad today? Imagine a modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror">Reign of Terror</a>. Think that domestic spying has gotten out of control? It has, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi">the Stasi</a> would make us wish for the &quot;good old days&quot; of the NSA.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I worry that our &quot;critical thinking&quot; helps to bring about the very problems that we seek to remedy.</p>

<p>Ideally, yes. But the mods here don&#39;t follow their own rules, so it makes for some awful inequality. Usually, one mod will stretch a rule to fit a comment to ban a user they don&#39;t like. Sad to see it happen, but it does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this place&#39;s primary importance is that it at least allows people to discuss alternative perspectives that get immediately deleted by mods or downvoted out of hand in the mainstream subs. I remember when I used to post at huffington post all the time, I used to have to to trick the moderation algorithm when I wanted to use terms like &quot;military industrial complex&quot;, &quot;Gaza&quot;, &quot;Monsanto&quot; and &quot;electronic voting&quot; because those terms would cage your post for moderator approval. Then when they moved to facebook for all their comments I was shadowbanned pretty early on after the change.</p>

<p>I love this place because I can post about all of those things and more and not have to worry about anything I say being subject to a  automoderating censorship algorithm or a moderator&#39;s whim. There is really nothing off limits here and places like this are indeed more and more of a rarity on the internet these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your support of this sub.</p>

<p>I often tell people that I don&#39;t believe 95% of the stuff posted here, its true I don&#39;t.  I enjoy having a place that offers alternative PoVs on current and past events.  </p>

<p>There are literally thousands of other subs with mainstream opinions dominant when I want to tap into that.  This place is intentionally different, we don&#39;t want it to be like everywhere else.  We pay a heavy price for our differences in the trolling it tends to attract, but we get better every day at mitigating that side effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, interesting.  I remember your OP from a week or two ago and I had already bookmarked one of the videos you&#39;d mentioned.  The main thing is just the time constraint of how long the videos are, I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading in my free time.  This sounds like something worth exploring though as I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t be spending so much of your time on it otherwise.  Thanks for the response.</p>
