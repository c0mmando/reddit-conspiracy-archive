        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The name, Google, appears to be a harmless play on &quot;googol&quot; -- a mathematical term for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros. The name reflects Larry Page&#39;s and Sergey Brin&#39;s (Google&#39;s founders) mission to organize a seemingly infinite amount of information on the web.</p>

<p>But as with all things Masonic, there is a deeper meaning.</p>

<p>It also means &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gog_and_Magog">Gog</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity)">El</a>&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newjerusalem.com/gog.htm">Gog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the original language, Gog means: &quot;under the roof&quot;. Magog means &quot;out from under the roof&quot;. Gog refers to Satan as he is captive, bound, kept as it were: under a roof. Magog refers to Satan being unloosed. As Magog, he bursts forth from where he had been bound, under the roof. The scriptural references to Gog and Magog symbolize the full fury of Satan unchained: the unleashing of the spirit of antichrist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity)">El</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ʾĒl ... is a Northwest Semitic word meaning &quot;deity&quot;.</p>

<p>In the Canaanite religion, or Levantine religion as a whole, El or Il was a god also known as the Father of humanity and all creatures, and the husband of the goddess Asherah as recorded in the clay tablets of Ugarit (modern Ra′s Shamrā—Arabic: رأس شمرا‎, Syria).</p>

<p>The bull was symbolic to El and his son Baʻal Hadad, and they both wore bull horns on their headdress. He may have been a desert god at some point, as the myths say that he had two wives and built a sanctuary with them and his new children in the desert. El had fathered many gods, but most important were Hadad, Yam, and Mot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So &quot;Under the Roof Satan God&quot; or &quot;Bound Satan God&quot;. Will they bust out &quot;MaGoogle&quot; or &quot;Unbound Satan God&quot; at some point?</p>

<p>**** Now check out their logos: ****</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://extremelifechanger.com/web_images/de-google-chrome-666-2d326bd.jpg">Chrome is 666</a></li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/EzmdMkn.png">Google Hangouts logo is 666</a></li>
<li><a href="http://theopenscroll.blogspot.com/2013/08/decoding-gmail-as-gmale-masonic-apron.html">Gmail masonic apron</a></li>
</ul>

<p>...and I&#39;m sure there are others. </p>

<p>So that slogan, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">&quot;Don&#39;t be evil.&quot;</a>? Pretty sure that means the opposite.</p>

<p>Gog El -- Be evil.</p>

<p>Yes, you or your source has unraveled the number 6 three times from their logo, turned two quotation marks upside down and stuck another 6 on top of them and interpreted what is clearly an envelope into a masonic apron. It must be so :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, here&#39;s my take on this. Full disclosure: I&#39;m a Freemason now, but before I was a Freemason, I was a big fan of Google. I even got a job offer from them, back in the mid-2000s, but had to turn it down because of family needs (a dying grandfather). I also had a company that I used to work for bought by Google, and many of my friends now work there.</p>

<p>So, this posting hits close to home on two fronts.</p>

<p>A few points:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;d be <strong><em>absolutely thrilled</em></strong> if Google were a deeply Masonic company, but I doubt it.</li>
<li>The founders definitely do apply many Masonic principles in their business dealings, but I think that comes more from the Stanford academic culture than Freemasonry. Classical education and Freemasonry have a very close history, so this is not shocking.</li>
<li>While I won&#39;t discuss membership in the Fraternity (and almost never know that someone is a Mason in other states unless they choose to make it public), I will say that even if Larry and Sergey were Brothers, the idea that they would be directly or indirectly responsible for every element of the branding is kind of naive.</li>
<li>The envelope logo of gmail does look like an apron. But then, so does the envelope icon that has been used in thousands of ways to represent mail delivery for over 100 years.</li>
<li>The &quot;Gog El&quot; thing is absolutely silly. If you have to dip into multiple languages, then I expect the result to be shockingly relevant. As it is, it&#39;s a radically different spelling that doesn&#39;t even seem to be a slam-dunk for evil (Gog is used many places in the Bible, including as one of Noah&#39;s grandchildren... it&#39;s oversimplifying to the point of misleading to suggest that it&#39;s just another name for evil/satan).</li>
</ul>

<p>A meta point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But as with all things Masonic, there is a deeper meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is often true. We enjoy layering symbolism (an art which is, I fear, becoming extinct outside of the Fraternity; the likes of Mark Twain and Rudyard Kipling (both Masons) don&#39;t seem to be producing much in our popular culture anymore). However, you seem to be using that assertion as a springboard to then justify any tenuous linkages that you can invent that circularly justify calling Google Masonic. That&#39;s just bad logic.</p>

<p>This seems a rather poor gambit. I&#39;m not sure why you chose to go down that road, but if you have some actual criticisms of my points, rather than mindless arm-waving and a link that opens on my phone with an unskippable ad, then please feel free to share.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Freemason. If there&#39;s one thing we respect, it&#39;s cogent debate. When you present one, I&#39;ll engage. Until then, I think we&#39;re done, here.</p>
