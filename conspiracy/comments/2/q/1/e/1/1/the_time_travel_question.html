<p>I&#39;m not saying it originated in our current time or timeline, but because it exists I have to think that it&#39;s creating a ripple in every dimension/worldline.</p>

<p>Imagine if a government had access to time manipulation.  They could bend time to their fancy to wage wars, maintain their empire, crush dissent before it started.</p>

<p>Once we create strong AI I imagine it would be possible to build a time machine within fifty years with the technological jumps we&#39;d make.</p>

<p>All food for thought I guess.</p>

<p>If then, you take into account the relative nature of time, and we can both agree that yeah, probably, within 50 years they&#39;ll be able to do it. So, they must have been able to do it already, and you and I just happen to have met in this manipulated and scrubbed time line.

    <div class="md"><p>The concept of time travel just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Actually, I think that anyone who thinks they understand how it could work just hasn&#39;t thought about it hard enough.</p>

<p>I say this because anyone who thinks they understand how time even works let alone how it might be manipulated might have overestimated their mental model.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox">Twin Paradox</a>. I have been searching for a decent resolution to that since I was an undergrad. At the time, and rather surprisingly, I asked a number of members of the physics faculty for an explanation (at a pretty decent university) and none of them had even considered or heard of it and none were able to offer an explanation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because there isn&#39;t one and despite the hand waving going on in that wiki article, it&#39;s a load of baloney.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re stuck in this time with no hope of moving anywhere except into the future at a rate of 1 second per second. However, i do believe our consciousness can be induced to change direction in the FIFTH dimension according to our will and that&#39;s more about using certain tricks of thought, minimizing access of your consciousness to any observing consciousnesses  to cause our conscious experience to take more improbable paths than it otherwise would.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t seen this yet, I recommend it as a way of visualizing the dimensions of this reality: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqeqW3g8N2Q">Vizualizing the tenth dimension</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would google quantum compass, quantum computer, quantum memory, magnetic containment, CERN and what it is doing.  If you add that all up it certainly points to a Time Machine.</p>

<p>I subscribe to the infinite universe concept.  If you ever traveled from this &quot;time line&quot; it would be next to impossible to be able to re-enter this same &quot;time line&quot; taking into account infinite universes and divergence when moving through time.  One could get really close but never get back to the exact universe they left.</p>

<p>Ya, a lot of people call me weird, but in my mind we already have time travel, and time viewing devices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had the same line of thinking that of time travel exist in the future it already exists. Where I have trouble believing it exists is in looking through history and even to the present. Would they not have stopped certain things like the Nazis from gaining such traction? Unless of coarse the things that have happened were allowed. Surely we would have stopped Pearl Harbor, but maybe the Japanese invented time travel since they seem to be pretty advanced technologically, so wouldn&#39;t they have stopped Hiroshima and Nagasaki? How about some of the US politicians wanting to ban guns. If it were in the best interest of the government to remove our firearms wouldn&#39;t they just jump to the left and step to the right, do the time warp, and change our rights so we cannot own firearms? Maybe I&#39;m thinking about this all the wrong way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you could say that a whole lot more stuff has happened but they went back in time and changed the course of events and left a few events in place, such as Pearl Harbor and 9/11 to use this for an advantage.

<p>I&#39;m not sure that conclusion is valid.  Plus, you&#39;re talking about theoretical physics...gedanken physics.  Talking about time travel is A LOT different than talking about a feather and a weight in free fall or something.  As an aside, I do believe time travel is theoretically possible.  But I don&#39;t think that means it&#39;s <em>necessarily</em> been accomplished.</p>

<p>A paradox emerges that prevents time from being changed or altered. Since time has been altered, there would be no reason to alter the timeline further since the desired result has already been achieved <em>before</em> a conscious decision was made to do so.</p>

<p>Second, I don&#39;t think time travel is logically consistent. What if I go back in time and kill my father before he meets my mom? I don&#39;t even think time is a real thing. All we have is now. There is no future nor past &quot;out there&quot;. There is only now.</p>

<p>wat. An omnipotent god in no way necessitates time travel. Further, god does not know what <em>will</em> happen he only knows all possibilities. Unless you don&#39;t think we have free will, which kinda makes karma or other afterlife repercussions meaningless. </p>

<p>That said... I do think there is such thing as free will, but only to a point. We all have physical and mental restrictions so free will only goes as far as what our bodies and minds are capable of. And if there is a God, who has designed us, then he has intentionally set these limitations on our bodies and minds, thus preventing true free will.</p>
