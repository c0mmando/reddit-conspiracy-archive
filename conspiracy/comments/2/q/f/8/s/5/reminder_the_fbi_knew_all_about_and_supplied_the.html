<blockquote>
<p>Law-enforcement officials were told that terrorists were building a bomb that was eventually used to blow up the World Trade Center, and <strong>they planned to thwart the plotters by secretly substituting</strong> *<strong><em>harmless powder</em></strong>* for the explosives, an informer said after the blast.</p>

<p><strong>The informer was to have helped the plotters build the bomb and supply the</strong> *<strong><em>fake powder,</em></strong>* <strong>but the plan was called off by an F.B.I. supervisor</strong> who had other ideas about how the informer, Emad A. Salem, should be used, the informer said.</p>

<p>The account, which is given in the transcript of hundreds of hours of tape recordings Mr. Salem secretly made of his talks with law-enforcement agents, portrays the authorities as in a far better position than previously known to foil the Feb. 26 bombing of New York City&#39;s tallest towers. The explosion left six people dead, more than 1,000 injured and damages in excess of half a billion dollars. Four men are now on trial in Manhattan Federal Court in that attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, this is the kind of stuff that just confuses me. Why in the world would the FBI enable these people to actually kill people and commit acts of &#39;terrorism&#39; instead of just apprehending them?</p>

<p>I mean, was it against the law? Nowadays if you say &quot;Fuck the Police&quot; on your Facebook you&#39;re liable to get a knock on your door and escorted out in cuffs on suspicion of domestic terrorism.</p>

<p>Domestic dissent is the only thing these government agencies have to fear. Acts of terrorism generally expand their power.</p>

<p>But all these dramas were facilitated by the F.B.I., whose undercover agents and informers posed as terrorists offering a dummy missile, fake C-4 explosives, a disarmed suicide vest and rudimentary training. Suspects na√Øvely played their parts until they were arrested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Besides Salems tapes there were quite a number of anomalies, which cast doubt on the OS of the 1993 bombing. </p>

<p>According to the testimony of Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, the FBI also concocted misleading scientific reports and pressured two leading scientists to perjure their testimony in order to support its prosecution of the men accused of the bombing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.public-action.com/SkyWriter/WacoMuseum/death/tscr/whitehur/fw_test.html">http://www.public-action.com/SkyWriter/WacoMuseum/death/tscr/whitehur/fw_test.html</a></p>

<p>And don&#39;t let&#39;s forget the role of <strong>Ali Mohamed</strong>. This guy was a green beret, FBI informant and CIA agent. He trained some of the <a href="http://intelwire.egoplex.com/unlocking911-1-ali-mohamed-wtc.html">bombmakers of 1993</a>, the leading highjackers of 9/11 and was the leader of the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya. Although he was arrested multiple times, he was never sentenced. Instead he was throughout his carreer protected by US government agencies and this protection is probably still continuing today.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/how-the-fbi-protected-al-qaeda-s-9-11-hijacking-trainer/3422">http://www.globalresearch.ca/how-the-fbi-protected-al-qaeda-s-9-11-hijacking-trainer/3422</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?complete_911_timeline_possible_moles_or_informants=aliMohamed&amp;amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline">http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?complete_911_timeline_possible_moles_or_informants=aliMohamed&amp;amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline</a></p>

<p>Mohameds story is usually ignored, or as a fall back position it is claimed that he was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faj6v4A6A4o">triple agent</a>, who double crossed CIA, FBI and the army. It is alleged, that government agencies now hide his role to protect themselves from embarassment .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, you beat me to it.  I was planning on posting a selfpost about the 93 wtc bombing after posting this yesterday:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2qa0vc/fbi_may_have_been_wrong_on_nk_hack/cn4tijo?context=3">http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2qa0vc/fbi_may_have_been_wrong_on_nk_hack/cn4tijo?context=3</a></p>

<p>Anyways, it&#39;s a lot worst then just then thinking of supplying the material.  The Fed and DA supervised the making of the bomb and looked like their informant knew they were going to set him up as the patsie:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emad_Salem#Claim_that_the_FBI_knew_about_the_bombing">Salem: Okay. Alright. I don&#39;t think it was. If that&#39;s what you think guys, fine, but I don&#39;t think that because we was start already building the bomb which is went off in the World Trade Center. <strong>It was built by supervising supervision from the Bureau and the D.A. and we was all informed about it and we know that the bomb start to be built. By who? By your confidential informant. What a wonderful, great case!</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then check out how the FBI agent ends the conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anticev: And as far as the payments go, and everything like that, they&#39;re there. I guarantee you that they are there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways, those tapes were given to the defence who never used them, very suspicious.  Even the Chicago Tribune ran thr story that it was the informant who biult the bomb:</p>

<p><a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/doc/283660292.html?FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;amp;type=current&amp;amp;date=Dec%2015,%201993&amp;amp;author=From%20Tribune%20Wires.&amp;amp;pub=Chicago%20Tribune%20(pre-1997%20Fulltext)&amp;amp;edition=&amp;amp;startpage=7&amp;amp;desc=FBI%27S%20TIPSTER%20SAID%20HE%20BUILT%20N.Y.%20BOMB">http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/doc/283660292.html?FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;amp;type=current&amp;amp;date=Dec%2015,%201993&amp;amp;author=From%20Tribune%20Wires.&amp;amp;pub=Chicago%20Tribune%20(pre-1997%20Fulltext)&amp;amp;edition=&amp;amp;startpage=7&amp;amp;desc=FBI%27S%20TIPSTER%20SAID%20HE%20BUILT%20N.Y.%20BOMB</a></p>

<p>But if you look at the wiki wtc 93 bombing page, it hardly mentions thus fact.  It was a very successful cover up.</p>

<p>Edit: on phone and to tired to fix the errors, which there are plenty.  Suck it if you have an issues with it.  Thx</p>

<p>Edit 2: I hate bots</p>

In Canada, our police infiltrated a group of Muslims and convinced them to do some stupid training in the back woods and make some videos shouting allahu ackbar so they could swoop in and tell the public they had just foiled a massive terror plot. One that wouldn&#39;t have existed without their inside agitator poking people along. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of the quote is that the FBI did not supply the bomb. There was a new agent in charge of the New York FBI office who didn&#39;t trust Salem and wanted him to wear a wire. Salem refused because he thought that would endanger his life. So the operation was canceled. Salem told <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Sayyid_Nosair">Nosair</a> that he had to stop because he thought he was being followed by the FBI.</p>

<p>That was more than 6 months before the bombing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramzi_Yousef">Ramzi Yousef</a> flew into the United States and synthesized the explosives from basic chemicals they purchased. The FBI incompetently did not realize that the plot was progressing without Salem.</p>

I hear a conversation between 2 people, I hear salem suggest the bomb was built an informant, but I don&#39;t hear anything close to indisputable evidence that it was a conspiracy.
