<p>facts can be tested.</p>

<p>indisputable facts.</p>

<p>these have nothing to do with proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What &#39;proof&#39; are you looking for?</p>

<p>that the government was behind 9/11.  have yet to find any.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>absolutely</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I won&#39;t even attempt to show you proof of 9/11 being an inside job</p>
</blockquote>

<p>why not?  if there is proof, it should be rather easy to show me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I will (and have through the videos linked) give you evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>those videos do not show evidence of anything.  they try to poke holes in the official story (which is a very good thing and I&#39;m glad attempts have been made).  trying to disprove one thing is not proof of another.</p>

<p>fair point.  but poking holes arent facts.  they are merely hypothetical what ifs.  for example, most believe that its simply not possible for OBL to orchestrate an attack as big as 9/11 from a cave. I absolutely agree that it would be extremely difficult for such an attack to be pulled off.  but just because its difficult mean it didnt happen? </p>

<p>well there is no evidence that it was a CD. Do I love or believe NIST entirely?  no.  but just because NIST story has holes in it, doesnt automatically prove that it was a CD.</p>

<p>correct.  and that would include many civillians ie building engineers and employees.  what incentive did they have? </p>

<p>sure.  but to wire and lace an entire NYC highrise with explosives, no.  that job requires very specific expertise that our navy seals do not have.</p>

<p>you are the one who said &quot;black ops&quot; team covertly wired and planted demo bombs throughout the building.  they are the first ones who come to mind.</p>

<p>like I said,  union workers control every aspect of big city highrises.  it is not possible for a team to secretly wire and plant demo bombs without someone noticing.  there are literally thousands of people who work there and hundreds of building employees.  you can&#39;t hide wire and bombs from engineers whos job it is to inspect every inch of the building at all times.  do you live in a small town?  have you ever been in a downtown urban highrise in chicago, nyc, hong kong, or any other major urban center?   life isnt someone video game.  what you think <em>might</em> have happened simply isnt possible without someone, who wasnt in on it,  finding out.</p>

<p>If it was CD, the most likely suspects would have to be the CIA (nothing happens in the US without their knowledge) and Mossad (5 dancing Israelis, Carl Cameron documentary on Israeli spies, etc.), with the approval of highly placed rogue government officials that also managed to stop certain FBI investigations (Able Danger, etc.).
