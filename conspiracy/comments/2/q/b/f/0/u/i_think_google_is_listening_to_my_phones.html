       I work in a retail store, and unfortunately I don't get to pick the music that plays in the store, and it's not really music I would listen to. Today as I was leaving the store some Mumford and Sons song was playing, and as I was riding the train home I opened the Google Play store for an app I needed. Lo and fucking behold, that song was on my "recommended for you" card.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never mentioned this song on any social media or Google service that would be "listening" for my purchase preferences. And this is not the first time there's been an uneasy serendipity between songs that play at work and songs Google recomends to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know Google identifies songs by "hearing" them, but is this actually a thing? Is Google listening to my phone 24/7?

       I have a Galaxy S 5 and recently we (boyfriend and I) started watching a show  that came out in 2013. It's currently mid season 2, but all of a sudden it's recommending I rate it. I've never heard of this show before a few days ago.... just seems odd.

       If its activated your phone is always listening, depending on the brand(motorola has always listening and samsung probably too smaller brands dont and claim to only listen when you are on google now app) because its expecting you to call it and ask whatever you need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just turn off always listening and go into google now app whenever you need something if its bothering you

       What if you wanted to go intense with it and root the android.. has anyone done this?   I've heard that some university students did an intense project where they flashed a custom bios onto a phone so that you had full ultimate control and monitoring over all incoming and outgoing stuff.   It would probably be very hard to do though. I promise I'm not making that up.  I probably even read it on reddit.

       If they're not, they will most likely be very soon. I can't honestly see how you can maintain profiles of individuals, correlating the kind of data they do and not grab something within those 18 identifiers. They get name, telephone number, addresses, etc already.  What happens when their background noise recognition app captures someone talking about a prescription they're taking with their doctor?

       Theres nothing to suggest they're selling the information to other parties, google is the one who listens and then chooses what adds to show you. Not saying its not a gross violation, just that it seems they're keeping it in house.

       Wow, that happened to me, too.  I hadn't mentioned I was sick anywhere online, but I was coughing a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       and entered "Di" to look up diphenhydramine (a cough suppressant) on my laptop.  Diphenhydramine was the first suggestion they offered (I wasn't logged into GMail or any Google services, either, and I have Ghostery running all the time).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are tons of things I'm more likely to look up starting with "Di" than that, and if I enter it now I get an entirely different set of suggestions.  It was creepy.  Useful, sure, but creepy.

       Similar thing happens to me all the time, but it's the autocomplete on iphone6 when I'm typing in the search bar. I'll be talking about something - a shop, a person, anything - then if I start typing it in the search bar the phone will magically guess correctly. Happens with really obscure stuff, not things that I've searched before.

       Same exact thing happened to me just last week. I've been on high dose prednisone and it messed with my blood sugar. I was waiting in an exam room when my dr poked her head in to ask if my diabetes was in check and as she closed the door and I opened Facebook an ad targeted for diabetes was the first thing on my feed!
I have never mentioned diabetes on any social media.

       I really like how facebook can magically find and suggest me to friend girls that I've talked to on Okcupid and Plenty of fish. It's happened to about 5 or 6 of them. I'll talk to them on the dating site and then Bam facebook finds their profile and suggests that I follow them.

       All of these sites use FB and Google trackers and are tracking everything you do. If you use a Mac, get Ghostery and watch which sites have them...which is literally every damn site on the Internet. That's why Google is so damn good, it knows everything about you because every site you go to is plugged into their analytics or is monitoring your search through your URL bar.

       Yea and when DoNotTrackMe+ wasn't that shitty 'Blur' service it is now it was amazing to me how many tackers it would block. Like literally thousands a day. Ghostery is on Windows and Linux as well and works in Chrome and Firefox. I suggest grabbing that and Ad-Block Plus.

       Ok, so there is this girl I've seen around school, had a few classes with, but literally never talked with. I mean for several months. This past semester I walk into a room to study and she is the only one in there. We start talking about the exam we are about to take and blah blah blah. Forget to ask her name. No big deal; walking out from the exam and facebook says do you know so-and-so? And its her face and a name I would have never guessed. Shit is creepy.

       That was my only thought. But I mean we walked to class together and took the exam. And she was still taking it when I left. So I really don't see when she had time to look. Maybe she checked in the 2 or 3 minutes before the teach passed out the exam. idk

       maybe your phones were logged into facebook at the same time, and since your phones were in such close vicinity, it tried to link you two together. just a theory. i know they do a lot of stuff with their "location services" so who knows?

       It's still easy to track you if you don't use Ghostery or Disconnect.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you visit a website with a "like" button on it, facebook knows that your computer visited it. When you are not logged it, it can still track your browser. At some point you will use facebook from the same IP-address and with the same browser version and operating system, perhaps on the same day or at the same time. Then they found the link between your surfing and your FB account, and they can even link the browser FB-cookies with the incognito FB-account.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really need to prevent the browser from loading these social media buttons, by using Ghostery or another tool.

       It is also a known fact that Google remembers your search results and even stores cookies and learns from previous websites visited.

       So since I am someone that is "pro gun" if I type into Google "gun control" my top search results will be a bunch of pro gun websites. On the flipside, someone that is anti gun if they Google gun control,  their top search results will be all about anti gun related subjects

       I actually learned all this on r/conspiracy when somebody made a post about googling Egypt. When a bunch of different people Google the word everyone got different search results, if you commonly read news reports about Syria your search result would give you many reports about the war and how it is affected northern Africa. For a majority of the sheeple in this country, when they searched Egypt all their top results were for travel information (or bugs, or food, or whatever the user had in similar unrelated interests)

       Wow, you guys.  There's a LOT of misinformation here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a mobile software engineer, thought I'd clear some things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off - google is not constantly listening to you through your phone's mic.  The CPU power required to do this would deplete your battery so quickly, you'd notice.  Cell phones compete on the basis of how long they last on a given charge.  Consumers want long battery life, and manufacturers are terrified of software that runs constantly, because it depletes battery life and makes the phone look like an inferior product compared to other phones.  Joe Blow doesn't understand the tradeoffs between battery life, constant CPU usage, screen brightness, etc.  He just knows that his friend's LG phone lasts way longer on a charge than his Samsung does, so next time he upgrades, he buys an LG and not a Samsung.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Android has gone to great lengths to make it very obvious what's using the battery power.  Every time your battery gets low you get a dialog box with a button that takes you to a battery usage synopsis.  The idea here was that hopefully the consumer would look at this and see that it was "Candy Crush XXI" sucking up all the battery, and not that their phone's battery just sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apple took a different approach.  They just flat out disallow most background activity.  Only with the new iOS 8 have they kinda-sorta opened up into supporting truly background processing, but even now, they're super verbose about apps that do it.  Every so often you'll get a message that says "Weather has been using your location in the background, do you want to keep allowing it to do so?"
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's assume that battery isn't an issue.  Phones aren't powerful enough to "listen" to things on their own.  There's simply too much math involved in "hearing" what song is playing, and to figure out which song is playing, you have to compare it to millions of signatures of other songs.  So the phones just send the audio to a central server for processing - this central server is a monster and quickly runs the math against the given sound, does the comparisons, and returns the results.  This is why you can't speak to your phone if there's no data connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mention this because, battery usage issues aside, if the phone were "listening" constantly, that'd be an ENORMOUS amount of data being transmitted, and if every phone were doing it there's NO WAY the carriers would have the infrastructure needed to support it.  Carriers are already buckling under data bandwidth demands - this is why you get throttled or dinged extra $$$ if you use too much data.  Thus, similar to battery life, this has led to all sorts of constraints on app developers, and all sorts of tools on the phone that consumers can use to see how much data they've used.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: battery life and data usage requirements make it infeasible that your phone is "listening" all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google has aggregated several disparate data sources about you - your age, browsing habits, locale, etc - and came up with Mumford and Sons, coincidentally, when you heard it in the store.  They do track you, but not through the mic.

       Please explain how "ok Google" launches the voice activated search assistant if the phone is not always listening. Background data is always being transmitted, at least in smaller amounts. I don't see why it's unreasonable to think that the Google and/or Facebook apps are using the mic to listen for more than just "ok Google." However - it's very probable that both companies already have an extensive database on every person and have developed extremely effective algorithms based on your location, your friends data, and a million other things to accurately predict things of potential interest.

       I would not be surprised if that was the case. I had my phone unlocked at the time on the home screen. Still, I had not summoned Google, nor was I aware that Google was listening for anything besides the summon, nor did I suspect that Google would find data it picked up from my mic on the home screen actionable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't honestly believe that there are constantly ears around my phone, but the fact that they're listening at all when they don't make it abundantly clear that they are is invasive and problematic.

       I don't think the data or power requirements would actually be that high.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half rate GSM is 6.5 kbit/s, which is only 24 MB per hour. Your phone has built-in hardware for doing the encoding, so it's not going to use a lot of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       That codec is built for real time, low latency communication, but for passive surveillance, the data upload wouldn't need to be real time. One could store GSM-HR encoded audio in memory and upload it intermittently. Bandwidth could further be reduced by running filters on the audio and compressing it before upload. Data use required could be reduced to a couple of MB per hour during normal activity and far less when the phone is sitting on a charger in a quiet room while you sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a GSM 2G TDMA system, which would be sufficient for moving this data, there would not be a problem of overcrowded spectrum because it's TDMA. This is sufficient for surveilling most of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a CDMA system, one would want to monitor interference from other from other transmitters and send when the noise level is below a certain threshold.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm not saying that your phone is sending audio 24/7, but I bet it's a lot more technically feasible than you think.

       no, it was research conducted how to manipulate people, they don't give a shit at being "better at it". Social Media is merely a channel for marketers to learn and map out interests, habits and behaviors of consumers; it's also used by governments.

       Your articles, were on perfectly ethical research DARPA was conducting.  They also said that DARPA shares that research with other agencies.  I fail to see how they are evil as a result of that.  You imply that they do "evil" things more akin to the CIA torture program but nothing in that vein is mentioned in your articles.  Thus, you are exemplifying confirmation bias by using data that is unrelated to your hypothesis to try to confirm that hypothesis (because you already decided that hypothesis is true).   Anyway, I'm gonna leave now because there is nothing you can do when someone has already decided something  (sure hope you don't believe area 51 has aliens in it....you'll end up being disappointed)

       Interesting thing: Facebook I think does the same thing. After mentioning a persion whom I've had zero contact with for over ten years, Facebook suddenly suggest this person as a Friend. I've not searched for them, in any means; google, facebook, email, ect. I immediately uninstalled the app and mentioned other random names with no ill effects. 
Give it a try. Mention random names of old friends. See if it suggests them. I'd be interested to know the results if any tangible became . . .

       Facebook admits they do this. Delete both apps. I've witnessed this happen to too many of my friends to count. It's no coincidence. Facebook admits it uses the mic to target ads.

       What iOS version?  I just observed it today on a few different iPhones. To be clear were talking about Facebook not Messenger. Also,  set Location to Never. Pretty sure it can read your texts too and I don't know how to disable it. On Android, both apps request access to microphone, camera, texts, location, etc and you can't do a thing about it.

       There is is still Xprivacy for Xposed Installer. Yeah, you need root in order to run this but it can and will block or fake data and it's possible to block hardware control with Privacy Guard that's built into most roms.

       What phone? What ROM? Which version of Xposed are you trying &amp; what modules do you need? I'm sure it's a very simple fix. Xposed was a little buggy for me at first when I started using it but most of it is fine now.

       Stock HTC Sense ROM on a newer HTC. I've never installed a custom rom or done s-off, but I've rooted before. I don't want to lose all my data installing a custom one either, but Cryogen looks pretty great. I really just need the custom privacy extension(s).

       I also recommend buying Titanium Backup. It's one of the few apps that I say should actually be purchased and not pirated. I always use TB and a CWR backup when changing ROMs and everything gets restored back over like nothing happened.

       I was recently observing friend suggestions, and some of these people suggested I have no connections to beyond being in the same place with at the same time. I'm guessing for some it scraped meetup.com data and for others, well, who knows? It's possible they're tracking and linking location data too.

       Possibly that's just a coincidence in the marketing of that song, I wouldn't freak out unless it pulled something out of your conversations or consistently did it.

       One thing that scares me about my Galaxy S5 is that at any time I can say "Hey Google" and my phone opens up Google search. I've only gotten it to work if I'm within a few feet of my phone but I'm unsure of exactly how this feature works. Is it listening for the phrase "Hey Google" for activation or is it constantly collecting the sounds in the room then sorting through them? I've gotten it to trigger by adding "Hey Google" mid-sentence.

       It's "Okay Google" and to my knowledge you have to already be running a Google service in the foreground specifically for it to listen for the "Okay Google" summon.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Okay Google" summoning is an advertised feature of Android devices believe it or not.

       Yup! First thing I do when I get a new phone/flash a new ROM is go and set all the security settings up. Stuff like location tracking, voice recording, text analyzation and prediction, everything. It's scary that this is all ON by DEFAULT. I watched a movie once, called 'Terms and Conditions May Apply' that had a reporter ask Zuckerfag why it is Defaulted to share everything. Honestly, he didn't have a good answer. And Barbara Walkters took his side and even looked embarrassed for embarrassing him on TV. He just didn't know what to say. His response was "Because that's what people want." No, Mark, THAT IS NOT WHAT PEOPLE WANT. People that don't understand technology don't even know what is going on in the backgrounds. I'm beginning to think they don't care either.......
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm aware that turning this stuff 'off' just makes it so I personally can't see the data. It is still there.

       No, you have to opt in for it to listen 24/7, otherwise it only listens from the homescreen.

       You can turn this feature off. I have mine set off, probably does not stop it though.
      </p>

       My buddy and I will be talking come upon something we that neither of us can answer and I will go to search it and usually its the 2nd or 3rd guess that google will do as you type.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also notice that my Play Music App runs a good amount of times in the backround. I would guess that is what is listening and processing for keywords or songs.

       I noticed something similar, I ditched I heart radio after I was called by a car rental to confirm a rental and within 30 minutes I got a pop up ad from I Heart that said "Taking a trip? Organize your travel playlist with yadda yadda yadda."

       I was sitting at a traffic light and a truck drove by for a local landscaping service called "The Weed Man." I said "Hah, the weed man," out loud.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I got out of my car five minutes later, Facebook had a The Weed Man sponsored advertisement right in my feed. Either amazing coincidence, location-based advertising that also knew the location of their truck, or they're listening to my microphone.

       That's not really necessary.  If you clicked on a link that was related to RAW, you will get ads that are related.  It's just correlation.

       So,
You guys (all of you who are posting confirmations) really believe that your phones are listening 24/7 AND sending that data back to Google and / or Facebook....
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea at all how battery intensive what you are suggesting is? Not just the listening to the microphone part but more importantly the sending the audio stream in real-time across the internet via whatever radio is being used for connectivity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further - the processing power required on the backend - I mean we would be talking about EVERY Android phone not just some - it's pointless to do it with just some, so we would be talking about a billion Android devices constantly listening and sending realtime audio streams back to Google.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phone would be constantly hot - because the radio is in full transmit mode constantly, there would be signs in extreme data use - sending realtime audio at a decent enough quality to be able to convert voice to text is not cheap on bandwidth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, anyone can run a packet monitor and watch the data flowing from the phone, if this were really happening - it would be very very easy to tell from the huge chunks of the data constantly being transmitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people would be better pointed in the direction of the social graph, they might find the answers they seek there.

      <p>
       It would definitely not have to be across the internet. And what gives you the impression that audio streams would have to be at the quality that we expect when making a phone call? You could easily drop the bit-rate/quality if it were a computer reading the audio.

       Addressed above. There is no reason to think that the audio stream would need to be high-quality.

      <p>
       Entirely possible that this sort of data transfer is not classified as user data usage, or not even data at all going through non-4g mobile radio (besides, how does the NSA listen to all phone calls if not everybody has a 4g connection?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, it is well known that the NSA have deals with Google/Facebook and others for user data mining, what makes you think that this isn't a two-way partnership, where the NSA trades data that could be used for enhanced marketing?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that said, I am not saying that I think that this is going on because I have no evidence to go off of other than occasional possible coincidences, but the reasons you gave for it not to be the case are not enough to dismiss the possibility.

       I don't agree - regardless of the quality of the audio being recorded - and transmitted - every time the CPU is woken up and every time the radio is woken up - you are consuming battery. Additionally in the case of Android - the source code is laid out there for anyone to read. Sure the code for recording and transmitting the audio could be hidden in the not open-source radio binary - but that still doesn't get around the battery implications. As for the packet monitor, the packet monitor can be run on the network not the device itself - I use pfSense for my router - I can easily watch the data flowing from any device on my network - see where it is going, the data might be encrypted - but just seeing where it is going is usually enough to use educated guesses as to what the data contains. It would be more advantageous to use the WiFi chip to transmit than the mobile radio - because it is a lower power consumption - meaning you could record and transmit for longer. As for snooping on phone calls - that would be much easier to do at the mobile network level rather than individual phones - and like a lot of other claims (being able to remotely locate a phone that has had it's battery removed, and being able to switch on a phone that has been switched off and thus has no data connection)  that have not been proven - and the physics behind them are extremely dubious - I don't believe phone calls can be snooped on via anything installed in the phone itself (other than Malware).

       It happened before multiple times to me. I think it's targeted ads. It happens when I talk about something obscure. One night I was talking about a very random brand name, the same night later on I checked my Facebook and it there it was a new add for that specific product that I've never bought before or ever seen that add, it's usually the same ads but this one stood out. It's been like that a few times, always after I talked on the phone about the product. Even my friend later on told me that it was weird he saw the add for that obscure product as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       My phone also sends out something, I have 4G always turned off unless I need something but even when it's off, there is still traffic. One time I was really close to my data limit so I turned off data and everything else that can mess with it. In the morning I check my phone and I get a message for using more data. So overnight my phone was sending something somewhere.

       You are not the only one. And I've met other people who had the same experience. There is something going on. Privacy is dead. They track everything. I am also being "throttled" on Reddit for making political comments. This whole "you are doing it too much". Before I could literally cuss a user out and I would never be banned or anything like that. Once I started posting political analysis and my point of view, then clear censorship by "time out" has appeared.

       If it makes you any more at ease, "you're doing that too much" is based on karma thresholds within certain subreddits, as well as some other factors. There's little actual human interaction that occurs with that. If you're posting opinions people don't like, and you have multiple unpopular posts based on karma on a given subreddit, you'll get a post timer, most often just for that specific subreddit.

       I think there's an algorithm that determines post timers, most likely not based on lifetime karma on a particular sub, but on a more recent basis. A couple years ago I got a 2 minute timer on
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       after I lost an argument with someone. About a week later with no negative karma, everything was normal again.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be that mods have the ability to set timers on individual users, but I think most of them are too lazy to let anything besides the voting system work outside of extreme cases.

       I don't have Facebook anymore. I got rid of it long time ago, mostly because I was posting unnecessary information, and because most people are using it to vent or express their passive aggressiveness. Ads are annoying too. In my view, those who want to stay in touch will call me instead.

       Just yesterday I had someone report to me that their android phone has figured out where they travel on a regular basis.  They were driving to work, not using the map application, and their phone (unsolicited) alerted them to a traffic accident on their route.  They are creeped out that Google tracked their location patterns and took it upon itself to start helping them without being prompted.

       When you agree to the terms and conditions of google and facebook you agree to let them track your movements in social media and other apps and use them to find out which adverts would be most likely interesting to you and show these ones on your feed and apps. This is mainly how they get their money.
For example as long as you are signed in to fb, wether it was your pc or your mobile, Facebook will track your movements even if the actual page is closed.
If you are doing something you don't want to share, I would advice to log out from your profile. Better yet, delete the whole thing.
These apps are free for a reason.

       I use ad block both on my pc and smart phone but when I use a different device I am really uncomfortable about ads. By the way the ads really effects both the brand and purchasing rate. So just use ad block everywhere. Sure they will still listen and tell me but at least you won't hear.

       People need to realize that it's probably your google account that tracked you. Your googleplay is tied to your youtube, gmail and whatever google service you have registreted to. They keep your history from your youtube and google search on the computers. That's why it ends up on the phone too. But then again they could also be spying with the mic, anything is possible.

       It's cringe-worthy/frightening to think of everything big companies like Google are doing these days to get an edge on selling ads to you.

       alright download Clean Master (the app). open it and go to the section App Manager. Click View on Pre-installed Apps. Delete "Google Play Music," "Google Play Books," etc. and it should stop. Another thing i recommend is downloading DroidWall, and using it to disable every app you don't use from accessing the internet. it will basically make it impossible for these apps to access the internet. so, say you have some kind of app which you think is spying on you, and you don't actually use it with the internet. if you disable it, you will no longer be able to use that app online, but that app will be unable of sending any data it receives from you or your phone. ta-da!

       I saw this post last night and almost commented.  Went to a Christmas party last weekend and saw all my relatives.  My nephew(a minor) whom I haven't seen in a couple years was there.  He is a freind on facebook yet his feed never shows up on my wall.  I mean never.  Now all of a sudden his posts are appearing on my feed as if just talking to him at the party triggered it.  I do not carry a tracking device ever anymore so the only trigger that makes sense to me is his microphone picked me up or Facebook has chosen to put him on my wall because of the holidays.
      </p>

       Peace on earth and happy holidays.

       I definitely believe this is somehow keyword activated. My girlfriend and I were talking about ordering a pizza last night and she called them on her phone. Then we get in my car and I go to put some music on and the first ad that plays is for Pizza Hut. This isn't the first time something like this has happened.

       It's not the mic, its the phone records. Google does have acces to your contacts and call log. She called the pizza place and that triggered the ad.

       Anything that has capability will be utilized.  I want hard mechanical switches for my data, microphone, cameras on all my electronic devices.  Just a few extra tiny switches on the edge of the case.  Maybe someone does this as a modding business?  Also, I see your posts around a lot.  you have my respect.

       Facebook admits they do this. Delete both apps. I've witnessed this happen to too many of my friends to count. It's no coincidence. Facebook admits it uses the mic to target ads.

       Today I was with my brothers talking about an old friend Dan P. I said his name probably three times. This evening his posts are front and center on Facebook, ones that are even over a week old. I hadn't seen posts on my "top Stories" from him for months.

       I had a conversation with a friend about a girl who was a mutual friend. I hadn't had any kind of interaction with this girl other than two occasions in person, we just happened to be Facebook friends. The next time I checked Facebook after that conversation the mentioned girl was listed under my "suggested pokes."

       It's not the mic, its the phone records. Google does have acces to your contacts and call log. She called the pizza place and that triggered the ad.

       I was recently observing friend suggestions, and some of these people suggested I have no connections to beyond being in the same place with at the same time. I'm guessing for some it scraped meetup.com data and for others, well, who knows? It's possible they're tracking and linking location data too.
