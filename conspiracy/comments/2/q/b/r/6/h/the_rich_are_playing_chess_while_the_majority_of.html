Thus playing checkers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rich elite have things planned out with contingency plans, scapegoats and false flag patsies.
They have their next five moves planned out.</p>

<p>Its hard to say what things can be done that would affect things in a grand enough scale.
Yes we can all band up but the time to when that will become a suicide march seems to be looming.</p>

<p>Beating them at their own game would take a lot of money and or time we don&#39;t have.
Or perhaps making deals with the demons themselves to pit them against each other until the last one is toppled…
Or use tricks like they do and play both sides of the fence, get real people for the people into both sides of the elections, stack the deck in as many fields as possible.</p>

<p>Police, politics, and judicial departments ... every place we can and then by pure majority of our civilian foothold re-write the draconian laws to something fair and just.
Oust the ones who break the laws and force them to take responsibility for their actions.</p>

<p>Go in fight club style…but instead of physically tearing down the corruption like the end of that story it would be done figuratively done. </p>

<p>End rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO, every like minded person should organize and refuse to play any game at all. 
Instead of trying to outsmart them at their game they rigged for themselves, don&#39;t play. 
Organize for pure unadulterated liberty. Make liberty the only defining principal. 
That way there&#39;s no ideology to debate and refute. No logical difference of opinion the &quot;elite&#39;s&quot; can counter the organization with. No infiltration and dissolution of the movement like occupy. 
Make it liberty or restrictions. One or the other for everyone or none. 
How can they publicly demonize liberty for all and those who organize towards   liberty for all without literally being against liberty?</p>

<p>They always do that. The good thing bout liberty is you can do whatever you want as long as it&#39;s not physically harming another person. Nobody needs to lead this common desire so there&#39;s nobody to assassinate. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not with you on this, here&#39;s why.  So what if I act like what you or even the majority of people deem a stereotype? I&#39;d be at liberty to do so.  Racists and generally discriminatory folk aren&#39;t going away anytime soon or later so give em the liberty to do so. The borders will naturally define themselves between groups of like minded individuals as long as they are at liberty to define them. Let&#39;s not march towards one world govt on this slippery slope;)  besides different regions of different customs and beliefs is where culture grows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I notice that for all the people who claim to have read The Art of War, not many people understand its lessons. Especially trolls in this subreddit. The global game is very much like chess, but the pieces can dress like other pieces. Usually their moves are what identify them and reveal their motives. That is why it is important to not focus on just one piece or organization, but to sit on the hillside and see the forest for the trees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think many are in one of those.
Late in the game they start to see things more for what they are and have become encumbered with debt, responsibilities and other obligations preventing them from in good conscious from just uprooting themselves from the situation to start anew.</p>

<p>Or at the very least left wondering what to do next.
That first step is always the hardest.</p>

<p>I know for myself it&#39;s not just the step.. But the step in what direction...
Some may say any step is better then none though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What needs to be done is all like minded people such as ourselves need to start playing chess.  Meaning... high leverage activities, and collaboration.  The ONLY reason the government is &#39;winning&#39; this battle is because they&#39;re not broke up into thousands (if not more) of sub-groups, with no central model of ethics, practices, resource distribution, and most importantly, knowledge/information/data propagation.  Furthermore, this is why infilitration/sabotage is a high-priority task on their part.  It knocks any serious threats back to the ground.</p>

<p>We need an industrial strength system; resilient enough to withstand sabotage, fluid enough to efficiently spread knowledge, intelligent enough to effectively allocate resources.  Its time to take our kid gloves off, and there needs to be a serious system put together.  This is THE most important step in efficient activism.  <a href="https://areasonablelife.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/fish-small-eat-big.jpg">Time to organize.</a></p>

<p>just many questions fall with it such as how much secrecy or openness to use. what sort of methods and mentality etc.</p>

<p>everything is already monitored so its not about flying under the radar but appearing as completely non-threating as possible until the very last minute.</p>

<p>and its also not a destroy the system from the inside setup, but more of a purge the bad blood with a fresh transfusion. then allowing the body to heal after the operation is done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise some really good questions, and quite honestly I feel I&#39;m not qualified enough on those matters to give my opinion.  I just know this is an in-depth conversation that needs to occur, if we wish to gain any real traction.  There are many of &#39;us&#39; in a wide range of beneficial fields to help put this together.  What needs to be done is to have a round-table of these minds, and that would be easy if its articulated well enough what can come of this.</p>

<p>Its safe to say if such a group/system comes into existence, it will get noticed by big brother.  This is why resiliency to attacks is so critical.  In my opinion, its <em>inevitable</em> something like this will eventually get attacked in full force.  This is to be expected, and prepared for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, in a sense prepare but not to the point of being labeled a prepper.
band together under a common flag but not enough to be considered an organization nor a cult.</p>

<p>essential skills would need to be shared such as general survival skills, tech know how etc.
people should be self sufficient enough that for the majority of things if someone should fall another can take the place so no momentum is lost.</p>

<p>the normal aim with big brother is to eliminate the head thus the body dies.</p>

<p>No true head, no true way to keep it down so the first step would be to spread the idea, get the mentality of it out everywhere.  Plant as many seeds as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all well and good to conjecture about what you COULD do.</p>

<p>The fact is, once you get into the right spot to make a difference, and get other people into the right spot, you might look around and say, &quot;Well shit. Now I understand all of this a little bit better. Things aren&#39;t perfect, but being able to see things from a wider perspective allows me to see why things are the way they are.&quot;</p>

<p>Things are the way they are because we have a system that works, for the most part. Because that system works, and because it would no longer work if it were too heavily regulated, some people are able to take advantage of the system by exploiting people and resources. BUT, overall, the way the system is now actually makes it pretty decent for a lot of people, because, let&#39;s face it, a lot of people IN the system wouldn&#39;t want to be in charge of running things, nor would they be capable. </p>

<p>No system is perfect, and no system will become perfect by rewriting laws, and definitely not by adding new laws. As it stands now, yes, there is a lot of inequality, corruption, etc. Human beings are just shitty. Societies are always shitty. It&#39;s always going to be that way. This is not a defeatist attitude. This is real life. Due to genetic variation, hormonal variation, and just general individuality, people will always have differing motivations and morals. You will never get an entire society to agree on any issue. </p>

<p>This all goes without pointing out the fact that power is the great corrupter, and there is nothing to guarantee that when you get your pawns into position they wont start feeling pretty comfortable on the other side and decide they like it. There is also nothing to say that, if you try to use the system to change the system, you wont get bogged down in the inefficiencies of the system that cause the inefficiencies of the system itself.</p>

<p>Things are the way they are because once you set a complicated system in motion, there is no telling where it will go, ESPECIALLY when you account for variables like foreign influence, cultural trends, societal issues, human emotion, violence, etc.</p>
