        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a post on some Chinese forum that is blowing up right now because apparently a user 13 days ago made a post warning people not to go on AirAsia Airline. He explained that the people that brought down MH370 is going to target another Malaysian airline to destroy Malaysia&#39;s Air travel industry or something like that and it all has something to do with the US (my Chinese is a bit rusty).     </p>

<p>The original post is time stamped December 15, and people were saying he was crazy until today. The guy was spamming the tread warning people and stopped posting just a few days before flight QZ8501 disappeared. </p>

<p><a href="http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-worldlook-1339619-1.shtml">http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-worldlook-1339619-1.shtml</a> the link is in Chinese, so just google translate it or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got a friend to help me translate it:</p>

<p>The original post:
Black hand (a metaphor for a shadowy organization that does its work behind the scenes) has hijacked and shot down MH370 and MH17. This has pretty much killed the 6th largest airline: Malaysian airline. Now the black hand are targeting AirAsia to ruin this airline cause it too belong to Malaysia. Given how powerful the black hand are I suggest that all Chinese thinking about traveling to avoid AirAisa, so that you don&#39;t disappear like those on MH370. </p>

<p>He (Landlord) then goes on to add: 
You could be happily vacationing, working, or studying aboard, but if you go on Malaysian airline or AirAsia you&#39;re dead, be careful.  </p>

<p>Tell you&#39;re relative and friend this message (to avoid Malaysian airline and AirAsia)</p>

<p>Somebody then ask how do you know this? and another laughed at him calling him a conspiracy nut. </p>

<p>Landlord came back to say: 
all you civilians get away (from the airline)
You can still hid, all those that see the post can still save themselves
Once everything cool down, then it would be safe to travel to Malaysia. 
He then goes on repeating :Don&#39;t be a victim go hid. </p>

<p>He then get made fun of and accused of being crazy, but landlord just repeats: 
Don&#39;t be a victim go hid. 
avoid Malaysian airline and AirAsia
and life is precious, and your safety is important  </p>

<p>After a while he says:
this is a life saving message. 
if you are traveling don&#39;t take Malaysian airline or AirAsia
Don&#39;t ignore this, once it happens you&#39;ll find this post but it would be too late</p>

<p>He then repeats these message again:
Don&#39;t be a victim go hid. 
avoid Malaysian airline and AirAsia
and life is precious, and your safety is important  </p>

<p>people are now fed up with him are are calling him crazy and making fun of him saying he&#39;s the Chinese noodle throwing guy from the video, just taking revenge on the airline. </p>

<p>He then relays a message:
Be suspicious of the US</p>

<p>more repeats of hiding and avoiding</p>

<p>Now other people are ripping on him calling him crazy or nuts, he only replies that this is important and need to hear his warning. </p>

<p>he manage to get some people to follow his warning and avoid the airline. </p>

<p>After December 17 Landlord no longer says anything, no activity from his account. </p>

<p>The next post are time stamped 2014-12-28. </p>

<p>somebody goes on to say that this crazy son of a bitch was right all along, making jokes that he is god, or some kind of god damn prophet. The rest of the comments are like what you find on Reddit , but landlord&#39;s doesn&#39;t say anything anymore</p>

<p>Edit: Turns out Landlord is just a mistranslation of OP. (

    <div class="md"><p>Hi OP,</p>

<p>Thanks for posting this. I&#39;m a native Chinese speaker, like your friend, and I want to clarify a few terms. </p>

<p>Firstly, 国际大黑手 is the full term used for &#39;black hand&#39;. This doesn&#39;t just mean &#39;black hand&#39; in Chinese. It means &#39;International big black hand&#39; which is more like &#39;despicable international bully&#39;. The phrase &#39;black hand&#39; here not only means that some organisation is secretly doing this (it&#39;s pretty clear from his tone that he&#39;s referring to an American-associated organisation and that he considers &#39;Murica a big bully), but also connotes guilt and basically pure evil.</p>

<p>In his original message, he also includes the phrase 心肠过于狠毒, which again states that this &#39;bullying organisation&#39; is targeting airlines due to &#39;overly venomous insides&#39;. I know I&#39;m not doing a great job translating it to English, but these points were missed out in the translation, which I feel has altered the meaning of his post.</p>

<p>Based on my knowledge of his context, he seems to be a common anti-American, pro-China forum participant. It&#39;s a bit like Reddit. I know that his knowledge seems too good to be true, but the highly biased, personal, and almost fantasy-like tone in which he wrote his post (seriously, accusing an organisation (heavily implied to be the US govt) of untold malice?) makes it difficult to trust him. This might explain why the other forummers replied with such skepticism.</p>

<p>After what has happened though, it seems too good (or bad) to be true that someone had such a clear prediction of what would happen. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m colored by hindsight though. This could all be a huge coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t understand how you posted this to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and got away with it?! You can&#39;t just write off someone&#39;s opinion because they believe there is a hugely powerful cartel of incredibly rich and powerful people engaged in a world dominating conspiracy! not here you can&#39;t anyway!  </p>

<p>国际大黑手 is exactly the same thing Hillary described with the phrase &#39;vast right-wing conspiracy&#39; and many american right-wingers call the NWO or New World Order, i&#39;m someone many of my friends look to as a debunker of conspiracy theories yet i wouldn&#39;t doubt the fact my country is run by a conspiratorial elite that uses their vast power and privilege to protect their own personal interests - <a href="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01889/queen_1889905c.jpg">i can even show you photos</a> - it&#39;s bad locally <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/17/oxfam-report-scale-britain-growing-financial-inequality">http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/17/oxfam-report-scale-britain-growing-financial-inequality</a> but absolutely mad globally &quot;the total income of the richest 25 million Americans is equal to total income of almost 2 billion people&quot; -- would america, Britain and the west act immorally to maintain this disparity? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Dossier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Dossier</a> -- and are these undercovered organisations working to protect the economic interest of the people at the top of the western economic empire? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhDViHTOZ5c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhDViHTOZ5c</a> </p>

<p>The big black hand is simply a way of colloquially referring to the fact that in power systems those that manage to get a large share of the power tend to be underhand, manipulative douchebags.  </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard for citizens of america and england to realise this but the billions of impoverished people in the world whose oil you&#39;re using, minerals you&#39;re consuming and labour you&#39;re paying an absolute pittance for don&#39;t find it hard at all to imagine the CIA and American government would do anything evil, haha america would never do evil to protect it&#39;s own interests, heh right - try telling the mothers of dead children all across the middle east or the deformed agent-orange mutated babies born to women whose entire village was firebombed simply because the american government didn&#39;t like the political system in vietnam! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There a on going conspiracy in chinese forums that this guy is in Chinese intelligence, or a hacker that got sensitive information trying to save as many people he could without making a big scene (guess he failed the second part). </p>

<p>There also a popular conspiracy theory going on the Chinese web saying Landlord is the same guy in the noddle throwing video, but the noodle throwing guy is secretly an air marshal or intelligent agent trying to save the people on the plane (pretty much all Chinese), from what happened to AirAsia. 
People are saying that the passport on the guy who threw the noodles actually shows a different guy, and some people found the guy on the passport but he says he never even went on an airplane recently. People are also pointing out that the haircut on the noodle throwing guy is very similar to the one you get if you are in the Chinese military, and that after he was kicked off the plane 3 more people also left the plane (very strange). Others are pointing out that the noodle guy went to the Chinese embassy right away after getting kicked off the plane, and he was calm right after he got the plane to turn around (a normal person would still be mad and probably arguing even harder) and nobody was able to find the person in the video. They are also saying it is very strange that he would make a scene that early in the flight, when most people are quite nervous when the plane just took off. Also the fine for turning a god damn plane around was laughable. </p>

<p>There are ton of conspiracy treads now on Chinese sites. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a Vietnamese news so I will do a quick translate. Basically there&#39;s this famous actress/model Duong Yen Ngoc, who used to be a police (which basically means she has connections with gov insiders), warned people on her FB that they should avoid flying with Malaysian Airline and another Asian airline right after the second MA incident happened. She didn&#39;t name the other one because she&#39;s afraid of a lawsuit, but stressed that there will another big accident(s). She and the Vietnamese gov are doing their best to protect the people.</p>

<p>That might be just coincidence, everyone laughed at her at that time, but now it seems just weird and scary. I honestly don&#39;t think she put that up just for 5 seconds of fame. There&#39;s definitely something BIG going on here.</p>

<p>Sorry cuz it&#39;s in Vietnamese. You can google her name to find more articles about her warning but I doubt there will be an English one</p>

<p>Figure 2: Not-normal threads, the timestamps do not agree.</p>

<p>Paragraph:  Further examples are plentiful. This proves that the OP is just spinning the news about the disappearance (after the fact). Normal humans will pray for the people on the plane, OP is shameless in exchanging their lives for more (site) traffic!</p>

<p>After somebody behind the scenes hijacked and shot down MH370 and MH17, as the world&#39;s sixth largest airline-Malaysia Airline is nearly destroyed, it is barely surviving. 
Now, this group has aimed it&#39;s sights on AirAsia, it too must be destroyed, since it also belongs to Malaysia. 
As this group is powerful, vicious and without mercy, I urge all Chinese to stay away from AirAsia to avoid another M370 incident happening. </p>

<p>My interpretation of what he&#39;s saying is, is that the US is sabotaging airlines that compete with our own, in order to not only take them over, but make ours look stronger. I mean, ok. It&#39;s plausible. Has some merit. However, what isn&#39;t explained is what happens with the people who go missing? Are they held indefinitely somewhere forever? Are they brainwashed into new identities and sent elsewhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no clue if this is relevant but the coincidence is rather odd. Obama was golfing here in hawaii with the Malaysian Leader 4 days ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20141224_Obama_starts_4th_day_of_vacation_with_another_workout.html?id=286793211">http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20141224_Obama_starts_4th_day_of_vacation_with_another_workout.html?id=286793211</a></p>

<p>Edit- also not sure of relevance but quite odd. Hawaii state DLNR ( department of land and natural resources) the equivalent of BLM on the mainland has withdrew and cut security for the president on Christmas Day and New Years Day. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/27700688/exclusive-dlnr-cuts-presidential-security-coverage">http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/27700688/exclusive-dlnr-cuts-presidential-security-coverage</a></p>

<p>Very odd considering that we host the presidential family annually. Seems like a large security cut and a lack of the government paying the state to insure proper security. </p>

<p>Since the big black hand is so powerful and vicious, I suggest to Chinese visitors, stay away from the airline, don&#39;t become another victim of MH370.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, lots of people are concerned this is directly related to the work Neil Keenan and his team are doing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s way too much of a coincident that he just released the video of them cracking open one of the boxes from the bunkers, the best proof yet that the Global Collateral Accounts are real, and then this flight goes missing exactly in the area they&#39;re working. </p>

<p>His work is the single biggest threat to the Cabal that there ever has been which is why people are concerned.</p>

<p>For anyone wanting to get caught up, here&#39;s a couple links for the background:</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/greenlight/comments/1fyibp/a_brief_history_of_the_global_collateral_accounts/">A brief history of the Global Collateral Accounts</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyIRidIxpbA">VIDEO - The changing of the guard - Neil Keenan</a></p>

<p>Understand these two links were given back when all this was just beginning to be made public about 3-4 years ago. We are now very near the end game.  What was once all talk and speculation is now very real and happening. </p>

<p>If Neil succeeds, it will be the end of the NWO and all that goes with it. He is not alone, but his work is the keystone.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Just saw that the Keenan Team replied to a comment regarding that flight: &quot;All fine. In fact great!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s big complicated saga and difficult to find much info on.  I&#39;ve been tracking the story since it broke a few years ago.  The best you can do is follow the reports from the main man himself, Neil Keenan.  I&#39;ve catalogued his adventure here in preparation for when they flip the switch so people have a place to go read all about how it happened and what to do next.</p>

<p><a href="/r/greenlight">/r/greenlight</a></p>

<p>Over the years we&#39;ve found that most people who get involved or claim to be turn out to not be trustworthy so I generally stick to hearing it straight from the horses mouth, again that Mr. Keenan.</p>

<p>Good luck, and feel free to ask questions any time, I have a general knowledge of these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get started with Keenan. Most of these &quot;insider&quot; figures have shown themselves to be unreliable over the years and have built followings akin to cults - very faith based and centered around personality, not results. The &quot;end of the NWO&quot; hopium narrative they spin is highly suspect at this stage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that accurately describes almost everybody who has come into the story since it first started.  But not Neil (fan boy warning) he started this thing and since the beginning has been the only one that has results, everybody else is all talk.

    <div class="md"><p>You admit your fanboyism, but do you realise that you&#39;re at risk of bias?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen results, other than many ineffective filings, all which have been quietly withdrawn.  This thing was (publically) started by Drake and Keenan and promoted by Wilcock, who was responsible for unleashing them into the spotlight. We all know what happened to the former - remember &quot;the Cavalry is coming. If needed we will be contacted. Sit back and watch the fireworks&quot;? That was 2.5 years ago now.</p>

<p>I cannot support this narrative you&#39;re promoting. The case towards the BRICS being a continuation of the cabal, not overthrowing them, is more compelling.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this chinese poster&#39;s warnings have been more accurate and useful then anything produced by the &quot;alt media&quot; figures like fulford, zap, keenan et al.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Risk of Bias?  I&#39;m not trying to promote some agenda or anything, just being real man, this is who I am and people can take it however they want, not my problem.</p>

<p>Look, it&#39;s obvious were on opposite sides of the fence, and that&#39;s cool. But you can&#39;t just lump Neil Keenan the man in with all the other atl media out there talking about him, that&#39;s two different things. One is a guy doing stuff, the other is a bunch of people talking about the guy and the stuff he&#39;s doing. Like I said somewhere else in here, when it comes to the subject of the collateral accounts it&#39;s best to get your info straight from the horses mouth, and that&#39;s Keenan.  Forget everybody else.  He&#39;s the guy trusted by and working with the actual depositors of the accounts. He&#39;s the guy they trusted to broker the certificates that Dal Bosco stole. He&#39;s the guy that filed the lawsuit, and also the one that withdrew it. He&#39;s the guy working with some of the holders too, the so called elders, and is also the guy who&#39;s outing the holders who are not acting proper, 24 publicly outed so far. Neil was there in Jakarta with Nelu while he was wrongfully imprisoned for the last couple years and worked tirelessly to get him freed. Neil&#39;s got the contacts, the black book, the original Hilton Green Accord and all the documentation. Apparently, he&#39;s also been nearly assassinated a half dozen times just these last couple years. And of course, he&#39;s also the only guy to actually produce a box full of gold from the supposed bunkers of treasure.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but that&#39;s enough action to keep my support.</p>

<p>As for the notion that somehow the BRICS are going to be some continuation of the Cabal, it worth considering, but just doesn&#39;t pass the sniff test.  For starters, Putin and China have been busy purging their rank of the Rothschild stooges and NWO types for years now. And if you listen to any of the goings on at the recent G77 meeting and the likes it&#39;s quite clear their feelings about the current Cabal rigged system that has been raping them for decades.</p>

<p>But none of this really matters. The only thing that matters is that actually people are the rightful owners of the deposits in the collateral accounts and they are getting back control of them. If they &quot;call&quot; the loans, it&#39;s game over for the bad guys, and that&#39;s all that matters.  Until that happens, this is all just pie in the sky.</p>

Totally speculative evidence, would need to see spectrographic evidence that it is indeed gold and that the markings on the side of these boxes are valid based on world standards at the time of boxing.

    <div class="md"><p>I can lump Keenan with those other &quot;alt media&quot; personalities, because everything you listed is hearsay as well, and ALL within the context and narrative that he presents. Reads like a b-grade spy movie in it&#39;s presentation, the assassination attempts being particularly laughable. One of them was supposedly from the OPPT when they were popular, which is petty and ridiculous considering how impotent they were.</p>

<p>The alleged purging of pro-NWO figures in BRICs does not match with reality - matter of fact is that they all have central banks and monetary policy under the mandate of the international banking system (BIS, IMF, etc). Their policy and think tank reports make it clear that the BRICS, with their new development bank and so forth, are an expansion of the current system. They are fully commited to and integrated within the G20, with the aim for convergance and consolidation. Any real animosity between east vs west is an illusion. So unless you have your miraculous mass arrests scenario, which is extremely unlikely given the track record of that claim, the banking system will have their way.</p>

<p>You&#39;re too emotionally invested in your savior figure to see past this, I&#39;m afraid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel torn, on the one hand it doesn&#39;t seem all that crazy of coincidence. The idea that mh370 was part of a conspiracy had already been floated around and I would hazard a guess that plenty of people suggested it would be done again. On the other hand this guy nails the airline, although this could be just coincidental seeing as he&#39;s just naming the other major airline in the region. What really gets me is the way he shares the information. If this was a guy just giving flippant conjecture and happening to get it right, I would think he would be more argumentative about his ideas. Usually theorists tend to connect dots and argue their points. This guy seems much more concerned about showing his message, don&#39;t fly Asia air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I remember correctly, it was something like from 38000 to 45000 or something that would pretty much knock them all unconscious; this was while they did that left turn across the Malay peninsula. For the record, MH17 was travelling at about 33000 or something like that when the no-fly zone over Ukraine was until 32000... Having said that, have you also noticed that it happened 40 minutes into the flight too? </p>

<p>Having said that, I&#39;m kind of skeptical about this being coincidental at the moment, unless 40 minutes is the point when people are allowed to remove their seatbelts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A comment from the same Chinese post <a href="http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-worldlook-1339619-2.shtml">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>不是美国，而是掌握着美联储的这几个家族：“罗斯福家族 洛克菲勒家族 哈里森家族 肯尼迪家族 亚当斯家族 布莱克利支家族 布什家族 塔夫特家族 杜邦家族 IBM沃森家族”，这几个家族掌握着美联储的财产，剥削者全世界人民的血汗钱。</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Translates to</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not the United States, but the families who are controlling the Federal Reserve  - The Roosevelts, The Rockefellers, The Harrisons, The Kennedies, The Adams, The Blackrichies??, The Bushes??, The Tafts, The du Ponts, The Watsons (IBM). These families are controlling all wealths of the Federal Reserve, while exploiting from people from all over the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe such conspiracy is originated from a popular book named 货币战争 or <strong>Currency Wars</strong> published in 2007. The book depicts The Rothschilds and their friends (named above) as the de facto wealthiest families who controlling the world economy. They would do whatever it takes to ensure their position is not challenged. But some accused the author for plagiarism and called him <em>Academic Liar</em>. </p>

<p>Referring to <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_fed30.htm#Part%201">the Federal Reserve Cartel</a>, some of these names don&#39;t make any sense at all and the theory might sound totally flawed. But it just gives you an idea about what the Chinese might be referring to by saying &quot;Big Black Hand&quot; who is behind the 3 fatal accidence. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe now that the world, the universe is a simulation, and someone&#39;s behind the control (having fun):
1) 3 planes belonging to the same country gone within a year
2) Of all the planes going through the same Ukrainian route, why must it be MH17 that got shot down??
3) MH17 shot down on the anniversary of TWA 800 crash.
4) strange circumstance behind AirAsia crash (there were other planes along that route and none reported too much problem with the storm).
5) the strange circumstances of MH370 disappearance..</p>

<p>What&#39;s the odd, really for all the above... 
Now wondering if 2015 will make me revise my belief..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too, was curious about the Black Hand and the Landlord. 
The names popped up under <a href="http://godfather.wikia.com/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II">The Godfather II</a></p>

<p><a href="http://godfather.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Hand">http://godfather.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Hand</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Black Hand, or La Mano Nera in Italian, was a type of extortion racket. It was a method of extortion, not a criminal organization as such, though gangsters of Camorra and the Mafia practiced it. </p>

<p>In 1917, Vito Corleone lives in a tenement with his wife Carmela and son Sonny, and works in a New York grocery store owned by the father of Genco Abbandando, a close friend. A member of the Black Hand, Don Fanucci, who extorts protection payments from local businesses, forces the store owner to fire Vito and give his job to Fanucci&#39;s nephew. As a favor to his neighbor, Peter Clemenza, Vito hides a stash of guns; in return, he is invited to the burglary of a rich apartment. His share of the loot is a plush rug, which he lays in his own living room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is a state player extorting Malaysia or Malaysia Air? Demanding protection fees or favors? I don&#39;t think this is solely spotty maintenance. There&#39;s too much coincidence. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hand_%28Serbia%29">WIKI</a> about the Black Hand of Serbia and it&#39;s connection with WWI</p>
