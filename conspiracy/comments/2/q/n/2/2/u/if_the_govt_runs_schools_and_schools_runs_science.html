       I would just like to say that most research is not reproducible by anyone. Your little parentheses won't save you here. The proper materials are often traveling across the globe, million dollars of lab equipment, or months of conducting surveys and studies. Few results actually get replicated. The ones that do fall into a category I call "the circle of science." That is to say science based on science loses some of its solid credibility. Take this relationship a few more times down the chain and all modern science is at best speculation.

       Absolutely! Very good.

       Hot water freezes faster than cold water under some conditions, surprising, but verifiable!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also be careful, when you say a decent chunk of the scientific community that still doesn't incorporate even a small portion of everyone else. Remember, scientists rely on the approval and support of other scientists for peer reviewed publication so they certainly do not want to cause any problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, the big issues: global warming and whatnot, are must less verifiable and have the biggest affect on legislation and international affairs.

       But that's not what actually happens. What happens is, if they don't like your research, its suppressed. Suppression can occur via journal rejection, funding withdrawal, blacklisting of your lab requiring your dismissal, and so on. Which means your scientific career is over.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the leaked emails of pro-climate change scientists you can verify they conspired to force journals to not publish alternative explanations or data interpretations and that all alternate explanations were not to be tolerated. They also argued over how best to manipulate data to make it most damming, supporting with their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at LENR. Validated by the DoD, DARPA, and over two hundred labs now. MIT committed scientific fraud. Pons and Fleischmann's careers were destroyed for being correct, having never violated scientific tenets, and not a single investigation has been initiated against the worst crime possible in science - against MIT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is easily corrupted and there are examples to be found for over a hundred years now. History is like science in that the victorious establishment write canon.

       No it wasn't. MIT stated it was fraud yet validated the experiment. They reported failure having never checked their experiment. A graph in their formal paper ( buried ) confirms a positive result. They touted death of LENR, via an actual party, immediately after starting their experiment. The level of scientific fraud and misconduct is amazing. Go learn before you continue to prove your fingers are faster than your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you saying you know better than thousands of scientists and hundreds of labs (including biggest names in physics). Even CalTech, one of the original antagonists have backtracked, admitted they incorrectly followed instructions (plus calibration errors) and now formally teach LENR.

       So all of science is bullshit? All of it? All the studies and research and ideas have all just been for the "Government" No one ever does it just to try and see how the world works or what happens? Give me a break.

       I did and proceeded to reply without thinking and I think your position is ridiculous even with that. Are you saying that every peer reviewed study or research article that has been published is being manipulated or cleared or something by "The Government".

       What issue? Facts aren't debatable. The scientific method isn't corruptable like politics. You either have evidence or you don't. And unlike your bullshit half baked "theories" scientific peer reviewed findings have evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, stupid enough to think that all peer reviewed science is rigged? The proper thing to do is learn the field and expose it as such. You know with evidence. But you have to be smart enough to do that which if you are so dumb as to think all peer reviews are rigged you're already going to fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you seriously think that every scientist is in on this global conspiracy? If your answer is yes, you're certifiably retarded

       And other competing scientists can use ALL the facts to show that individual is lying. Take that dipshit who started the antivax movement. Completely discredited by the scientific community using all the facts. You only seem to be providing enough of a baseless narrative to support your preconceived idea that ALL scientists are in on a global level conspiracy. That makes you a complete idiot.

       Wrong. They are places where people with incredibly more qualifications review their peer work. Their work as always includes their evidence and method. If its rejected its not because it goes against the grain its because its not substantiated. Much like your claims.

       You are clearly a member of the laity of the science faith.

       The only thing you demonstrate with this statement is how limited your own imaginative capacity is with respect to the discussion. It needn't be all. Ideologies can spread intentionally or organically and have real world consequences for the institutions through which they spread. In the case of gate-keeper academic institutions ideologies become the framework in which questions can be asked and the corresponding framework in which data is analyzed and modeled. Kuhn wrote about the subject extensively in "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions".

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You are certainly not. Neither am I. That's a very specific label with real world qualifications.

      <p>
       Real qualifications given out by a real board members that were given the ability to dictate rational versus irrational lines of inquiry within their chosen fields from on high. Real men of distinguishment and learning steadfastly dedicated to propagating the faith in its orthodox form to the masses of today. The proud and singular practitioners of Real Science carrying the torch of enlightenment against the dark black ignorant masses of pseudo-scientific heretics and filthy backward pagans.

       Proud we faithful are of our true mastery of that most holy rational structure, the circle. Woven deeply into the very logic of our credo is the great looped form of the most high shape, the circular. Here then, an ouroboros convinced of its reality by the rapidity with which it swallows its ta(il|le).

       Or you could not make stupid blanket statements like all scientist are paid by taxes. That's fucking retarded. You couldn't be more wrong. There are plenty of privately funded scientists and researchers. How about you substantiate how scientists only are paid by tax dollars..  I won't hold my breath.

       If there is no money there is no research, no testing etc. In this way the scientist are controlled by the money. Even valid research that is financed is often shut down by bigger money if it effects their bottom line.

       Check out this doc which speaks to the science behind modern medicine and the money that controlled how we now think about it, and the scientist that are still being controlled by it.

       Think of all the people diagnosed with cancer every year that strap themselves up to the chemo drip and die. EVERYBODY has lost someone to cancer and yet we buy the idea that nothing can be done, all the fundraising and money that goes into cancer research,  and the best treatment is the same poison that they have been pushing since the 70's, it's a load of crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are valid alternatives, people are actually curing cancer, but they can't get it out to the people because of the FDA and the Rockefeller's and their inability to get funding without their consent. It's ridiculous. Find the documentary

       Money is the problem dude. You cant live free and equal with money, because if I have more money than you, my life is worth more than yours, im worth more and I can have things you can't. If a swat team had time to save either a wage slave,  or a multimillionaire in a hostage situation, what order would be given on which life to prioritize?  There can be no equality or freedom with money, because when people have more money, they have more power. And with enough power, they can rule. And are ruling us right now.

       I like what you've got here, but I do not agree that everyone needs to be equal. This is kind of a ridiculous goal and the only way we would have it is if there was one person on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am far more interested in having all men created equal, that is: everyone is born into a world where they feel they can do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this in mind, money is kind useful tool to transfer the wealth each person creates by helping others into a way to help themselves.

       Right, and to motivate these people to these positions we should give them more resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply, why should the guy whose job it is to clean floors 12-16 of an office building the same resources as someone who manages a farming company that gets food to 100 million people nationwide?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is important are two things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the janitor, had he worked hard on the goal of feeding 100 million people, should have been born with the potential to be in the CEOs shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) the additional resources the CEO procures should be directly proportional to the additional help he is doing. Clearly the guy isn't picking every crop his company sells, but he is a vital instrument in its organization. The proper price can only be realized when the market for CEOs becomes more competitive.

       A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world.

       I'm not saying it's not absolutely proven, but you seem to think that scientific theories are never right, since science in your opinion is biased. I'm trying to explain that there are things that we do know for a fact, such as gravity, heliocentricism, photosynthesis, atomic and molecular structures, and more, that have been all but entirely proven.

       I did and proceeded to reply without thinking and I think your position is ridiculous even with that. Are you saying that every peer reviewed study or research article that has been published is being manipulated or cleared or something by "The Government". I still think you don't have a leg to stand on.

       What issue? Facts aren't debatable. The scientific method isn't corruptable like politics. You either have evidence or you don't. And unlike your bullshit half baked "theories" scientific peer reviewed findings have evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, stupid enough to think that all peer reviewed science is rigged? The proper thing to do is learn the field and expose it as such. You know with evidence. But you have to be smart enough to do that which if you are so dumb as to think all peer reviews are rigged you're already going to fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you seriously think that every scientist is in on this global conspiracy? If your answer is yes, you're certifiably retarded

       I would just like to say that most research is not reproducible by anyone. Your little parentheses won't save you here. The proper materials are often traveling across the globe, million dollars of lab equipment, or months of conducting surveys and studies. Few results actually get replicated. The ones that do fall into a category I call "the circle of science." That is to say science based on science loses some of its solid credibility. Take this relationship a few more times down the chain and all modern science is at best speculation.

       How is saying that global warming is not a problem that we must curb our consumer habits to prevent the same thing as climate change isn't happening? I don't think you have an open mind, I am no longer interested in talking to you today. Maybe in the future we could discuss this, but I don't think you are bringing much to this thread in the way of discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said we can separate scientists and mainstream scientists but you can't handle that. Even though the definition of a scientist has nothing to do with professional careers, academic positions, or anything but intellectual curiosity.
