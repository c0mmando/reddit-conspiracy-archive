       “After exhaustive research, the good news is that overwhelming evidence reveals that no children or teachers died at Sandy Hook two years ago. For relief, I have filed lawsuits against the media in US District Court in New Haven for Fraud and Terrorism. Here is an example of our abundant evidence, Exhibit D: The Connecticut State Police dash cams record no evacuation of children from school at critical moments:

       I've seen so much resistance to sandy hoax truth in this sub, I think it really scares the people who were blatant enough to pull this bull shit, it's incredibly easy to show the huge amount of deception invoked in this incident and it's got some powerful people running scared!

       I think most events and pr are conspiracies. I think there are intelligence firms who would and could stage violence and terror. I don't think sandy hook is an example of this because most of the evidence ive seen attempting to prove it as a conspiracy is just bad.

       I think saying the evidence of it being a conspiracy being bad is a cop out. Sure it is bad, I don't disagree. It's head and shoulders more than the evidence provided that anyone actually died, though.

       Honestly, I was really into conspiracies before a few years. All the 9/11 and lunar landing evidence seemed way more convincing than a few dashcams.

      <p>
       Not saying this isn't true thou, it can be a conspiracy, I just think for such a huge lawsuit we should've gotten better evidence.

       "Running scared?" In case you may have missed it, your so-called crisis actors just filed a suit against Bushmaster. Now why would they expose themselves to the discovery process of a lawsuit deliberately if they were so "scared"? You think Bushmaster isn't going to do everything in their power to avoid having to pay a hefty settlement? But when someone mentions the lawsuit against Bushmaster you guys get real quiet all of sudden, because it doesn't fit your "hoax" narrative at all. Strange huh?

       They're filing the suit as part of their gun-control initiative, which
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       fit the narrative that the event was orchestrated in favor of gun control. I mean, if they're not paid gun control lobbyists, why are those idiots suing Bushmaster for the acts allegedly committed by a crazed gunman in the first place? Who are they going to sue next? The company that made his sneakers or his car?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think they anticipate to win their case, because it's inherently absurd. They are not afraid of any 'discovery process' because Bushmaster won't have to try very hard to win the case. Like, duh?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's incredible how shameless they have been in pursuing this political agenda in the wake of the alleged deaths of their children. And yes I do think they are afraid of the truth surrounding Sandy Hook coming out, primarily because they know it was a sloppy and brazen operation.

       How do you figure? If "they" are so afraid of the truth, and Bushmaster isn't in on it, won't Bushmaster expose the truth? This is a contradiction.

       There is no precedent in American history for successfully suing a gun manufacturer for something like this. Unless the gun had a manufacturer's defect that resulted in the deaths of those children, they are simply not responsible. It's a frivolous case filed in order to get attention in the news media, they won't actually win the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, the reason I think you're stupid and haven't thought this through is because you haven't even considered what a PR disaster it would be for Bushmaster to claim that Sandy Hook was a hoax as their defense. Like seriously, are you really
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       stupid? The Bushmaster lawyers are simply going to argue that their guns work as designed, they are legally manufactured and distributed, and there are volumes upon volumes of laws and policy that state that gun manufacturer's are not responsible for their misuse in the hands of others. In other words, "Guns don't kill people, people kill people."

       A "PR disaster"? For a gun company? Whose guns were used in a mass shooting of children? Yeah, I'm sure they care more about PR than their bottom line. LOL Clearly they are in the feel-good business. Besides, all they would have to prove is that THEIR gun wasn't used in THIS shooting and the case would be dismissed. They wouldn't have to go into all the other details about a supposed hoax. The public would do the rest once it was proven in open court that this gun wasn't used because this incident didn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI, ad hominem attacks weaken your argument significantly. So does the fact that you can't seem to distinguish a civil suit from proposed legislation, i.e. "They're filing the suit as part of their gun-control initiative". A civil suit has nothing to do with gun control laws, it's about monetary compensation.

       Attention in the news media to what end? When the 40 proposed gun control laws that cropped up in the wake of this incident have already been defeated? This incident is old news. And most people don't care about the PR of the company that made their gun, unless that PR states that the guns are defective. If the gun functions as desired that is all they need to know. The companies donations to "save the whales" are not considered by buyers when picking out an assault rifle. In fact, the fact that the gun functioned the way that it did is a
       <em>

       EDIT: 40 proposed in Connecticut ALONE after the first year - for all states, the total proposed was about 1500, and the total that became law was 109. Of those 109, 70 actually LOOSENED gun restrictions. (Source:

       You may not know this, but there's a small contingent of people who don't believe we really landed on the moon. Personally I think we probably did, but that's one of my favorites. I just read an expose on how Buzz Aldrin had a nervous breakdown after returning to earth and it is interesting....

       I think they landed but that it's possible that the footage was faked to ensure a good broadcast. I can imagine that's why Buzz was angry enough to punch a person who said that he didn't go to the moon. He's sick of people not believing he did something he did.

       It doesn't fit the narrative because if these were actually just actors and this whole thing didn't really happen that would all get exposed in court.  Bushmaster is a very wealthy company with a team of lawyers who would uncover that shit and show it to the entire world to have the suit dismissed.  Nobody in their right mind would file this suit if the whole event was staged.  And it also won't fit the narrative once the families lose the lawsuit (as they will - people sue gun manufacturers after mass shooting events ALL THE TIME and they lose) and it again stamps out any idea of gun control.  However, this suit has nothing to do with gun control.  In fact, the whole reason there is a lawsuit in the first place is because legislators neglected to pass any real gun control laws after the shooting, despite an overwhelming majority of Americans supporting things such as the Universal background check (as I suppose they would have if this was a staged event to force gun control).  This is a civil suit.  If the families win it will only get them money.  This has nothing to do with legislation and no gun control will come of this either way.  This suit does nothing but peck away at the idea that this whole event was a hoax.

       Exactly. At this point, if people had the evidence they claim to show that those people ARE crisis actors, we'd have real names now, and be able to IMDB them/actually fact check it. The good thing about this court case is, it does exactly what you said it will. Debunk the theory. It already has in some small ways. No gun control legislation will come of it, and it's a civil matter. They're suing for money for the families. Not suing the state. Also, they'd be forced to use their real name in court, and if they didn't, that's filing a false instrument, and perjury. The case will go nowhere, as cases like this never do. If there were really crisis actors, this Bushmaster lawsuit would surely expose them all. Defense would expose that all day long in court, and have it thrown out in minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, unless you're totally dedicated to the fact the whole thing is staged, and there were crisis actors, and willing to say that of course the judge and the court will have been staged, or paid off, or actors aswell, then admit you have no concrete evidence to support your narrative, because I know you don't.

       Nobody is pissing on the gavel of dead children. We are urinating on the sloppy, inconsistent 'official story' that Connecticut officials made up in order to cover up the fact that it was a CIA project to usher in a dialogue over gun control.

       I think that, because of all our government had done wrong, and covered up (JFK, Area 51, Boston Bombing, 9/11), that they now are just ready and willing to accept they are behind anything, and just use whatever shoddy evidence is presented, like Sandy Hook crisis actors, cause they know not to believe the common narrative. Only problem is, when the evidence supports the common narrative, it only emboldens them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying there aren't conspiracies. I wouldn't be here if there weren't. Just saying that they now don't know when a real one crops up, and when something is just a tragedy.

       Riiiight and I suppose you believe in all conspiracies and there is no nuance to a conspiracy and every fact we know about one particular conspiracy is in reality the exact opposite. Your willingness to just make up stuff I said (these are not my favorite people) means you have no credibility to begin with.

       No, because the Sandy Hook hoax theories are all totally illogical, based on no evidence at all and most have long since been debunked. Most of them claim it never happened - like denying 9/11 happened - which people find offensive. And the proponents are the rudest, most dickheaded group in the sceptic community - remember the guy who stole the memorial for the kids?
      </p>
      <p>
       Occom's razor: the simplest explanation is that one weirdo kid went crazy with a gun and entered a school to kill kids. He was mentally ill beforehand and had access to guns beforehand.

       Show me the supposed evacuation dash cam video, the death certificates of the teachers and students, crime scene evidence, explain to me why the road would be blocked off to emergency services like ambulances and other first responders. These are just a FEW of the inconsistencies.

       It's an active shooter situation. Watch the film of the Sydney siege, all the ambulances are about a block or two away and take a minute or two for the EMS to wheel a stretcher up to the restaurant doors. Don't want any dead EMS.
      </p>

       The range of the Sandy Hook gun was a lot further than the shitty shotgun in Sydney, too.

       An "active shooter" who committed suicide? Does not seem like he would be very active to me. . . Furthermore once the scene was secured why were they EMS not allowed to proceed?

      <p>
       According to the official story: Somewhere between 10:10-10:20 ( could be noon ) the children were evacuated from the school. If the children were being evacuated then there must be enough evidence to reasonably believe the scene was secured. Yet still the EMS were blocked even during and after this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: 10 Am is the reported evacuation time.

       From the firehouse to the school the road was completely blocked off. They also refused to call in mediflight choppers. No one was brought out to the triage area, no one with medical expertise was able to get in there to even pronounce anyone deceased. This thing violates every medical protocol in the book. Thankfully, rather than being prepared to do their jobs they certainly made sure everyone had their correct fema badges on and displayed from the visible sign on CNN and fox broadcasts, and they at least had plenty of porta potties brought in to suit all these actors needs. You obviously haven't seen any of this evidence and you are just parroting some horse shit lie you heard. GTFO seriously, we are here to have serious discussion and you are either intentionally trying to be a half wit or you are totally out of your element Donny!

       I am having some difficulty in finding the particular video interview with some of the local EMS which I believe was conducted by CNN. The clip i am referring to may be within "We need to talk about sandy hook". So therefore I cannot provide you with absolute proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I must quip that if they were allowed to proceed on foot, why are their no photographs of the 28 dead being brought from the school by ems personnel?

       Because no press photographer in America is going to release images of obviously dead kids being moved around and no policeman is going to allow them to film once the place is secured.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no press photos of the mangled kids at OKC except the famous image of the fireman and baby, taken by a guy who happened to be there when the bomb went off on a public street and while the rescue operation was ongoing. Sandy Hook did not take place in public so it is a totally different situation for photographers to the heavily televised Boston and OKC bombs. It's like asking for photos of children killed by their parents in a family house - those never get released.

       It would be horrifying to release pictures and films of kids getting shot up to the public. They would never do that, they especially would never make a film about a school massacre and release it in movie theatres. That would never happen as it is too horrifying

       Likewise these people who believe the official script often have a hard time of providing evidence that it did indeed happen. Lol coincidence?

       And yes, when the official story and the MSM fail to do their job properly it is up to citizen journalists to make their own news.

       We have the faculty of believing it or not. The choice is ours. We would simply like evidence either proving or disproving, I have no hidden agenda other than not being lied to by this so called government of mine.

       You have already said time and time again that no evidence short of actually seeing dead kid's bodies is going to get you to climb down off the crazy train.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since you asked, the evidence I have is a group of parents that you think are "crisis actors" has filed a suit against the gun company which will have to stand up to the judicial standard of proof in court. It is unlikely that perpetrators of such a great fraud would deliberately put themselves up to that type of scrutiny if there was really "so much to hide". Doesn't make a damned bit of sense.
      </p>

       They claim that these weapons are unfit for civilian use, yet they apparently have no qualms about militarized state-side police being equipped with these types of firearms. Does it not seem reasonable to you that within the years leading to 2012 and since there has been a massive influx of these type of shooting situations pushed by the media? It reeks of public consciousness manipulation to me. They are trying to sue a gun company for making guns that some supposed nut killed a bunch of people with? You don't see car companies getting sued very often when someone is the victim of a hit and run. . .

       "In recent years, many top-selling brands — including the 195-year-old Remington Arms, as well as Bushmaster Firearms and DPMS, leading makers of military-style semiautomatics — have quietly passed into the hands of a single private company. It is called the Freedom Group — and it is the most powerful and mysterious force in the American commercial gun industry today." (

       I do not see a company this powerful taking it up the butt to help cover up a conspiracy that potentially has the power to reduce its annual market share even further. Remember, politicians don't run the government anymore -
       <em>
        corporations

       do. If there was anything fraudulent about Sandy Hook, Freedom Group lawyers and PI's would rip that shit to shreds.

       You obviously have my looked into this incident, because if you had you would not say that claiming the official story is false is based in no evidence, I not here to hold your hand, if you think that the official story is tri, do some digging, look at the police dashcams, that are pilocarpine record and that show official claims are false, look at the actions of medical personnel on the day in question, why was there no triage at the school, why were none of these "dead children" pronounced so in a hospital after all attempts to revive them were exhausted?

       You've obviously never worked on EMS before. EMS would never be allowed to enter an environment that recently had an active shooter until the police went in and did an extensive sweep of the school to check for other gunmen or dangers. Rule #1 of EMS is that the safety of the crew is more important than the safety of the patients.

       <strong>
        one

       police cruiser, not even facing the school, because it doesn't show the evacuation. Of course, an entire circus parade, complete with elephants, could have been going behind the cruiser, and it wouldn't have shown up.

       And the entire point you are mentioning is about 1/10th of the film, what about the rest of the verifiable evidence? I am curious of this information you have that will prove the public police reports wrong, and explain a lot of the blatant anomalies in the aerial footage. They also clearly state multiple times, and quantify it with aerial footage, time stamps, police footage, and police reports.

       I think that conflicting police reports, inconsistent video, time stamps, and inconsistent testimony is more than enough for a court case. Until you can prove said documents as false, all you are doing is chipping away at the weakest evidence, thinking you're winning. ;)

       Actually, the closest you have come to any specific [discounting uselessly vague statements like "inconsistent video"] is "blatant anomalies in the aerial footage."

       I did watch the entire video, Yes, the evidence was "laid out pretty clearly" - but, to me, was then found wanting, either being the result of shoddy investigative work and/or having credible alternative, non-hoax explanations. I've already given plenty of examples thereof. Your contrasting refusal (not uncommon among hoax theorists, I've found) to provide and stand behind a single piece of evidence is, I think, quite enlightening.

       12 words or less? Hanlon's Razor: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity." In this case, the simple idiocy of letting a mentally-disturbed young man have copious access to lethal weapons. Conspiracy should very rarely be the first impulse, with people then somehow required to disprove this. Also, "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence," and the idea of this being a hoax, without precedent in American history, is certainly a very, very extraordinary claim. The evidence for it? Far from extraordinary.

       So, I'll ask again. Give me the best single point from this "major evidence" that supports the hoax narrative, and we'll talk. But actually, there are thousands of pages of words, pictures and other documentation in the official report, all of it virtually 100% consistent with the standard narrative. The hoax theory seems to offer precious little which doesn't fall apart, or have an alternative explanation, when given adequate scrutiny.

       Wait, why was there only one camera? Why couldn't record? Doesn't it go against all security procedures to not have cameras with recording capabilities put all around a school?

       The camera couldn't record because it was just part of the intercom system. Few outside the school security business would have thought, before that day, any more than this would be needed for an elementary school.

       I can't say what anyone "thought", obviously. But regardless of what you think, there is no apparent evidence which says there
       <strong>
        were
       </strong>
       any cameras in the school, no. Not one of the 600 pupils, their families, teachers, staff, or anyone else who had ever been in the school, has suggested otherwise. To me, it makes the whole "no video footage" thing entirely explicable.

       Well, one can conclude that there were no cameras if after all this time something as important as footage isn't mentioned in the evidence. Which then leads one to wonder why there wouldn't be any. You have to ask yourself, why wouldn't anyone think to include something as important as recording cameras within the school? I'm not trying to advocate that Sandy Hook is a hoax, but there's a lot of stuff that's stupid when you think about it that kinda makes you wonder, you know?

       Per

        this report
       </a>
       on school safety and security measures, in the 2011-12 session, only 64% of all public schools reported using security cameras. However, there does also appear to be significant variation by grade.
       <a href="http://www.nasponline.org/advocacy/schoolsecurity.pdf">
        This report
       </a>
       , from a couple of years earlier, gives rates of 84% for high schools, but dropping sharply to barely half (51%) of elementary/primary schools. So, there isn't really anything particularly unusual about the lack of cameras: especially in an older facility like Sandy Hook, it's likely par for the course.

       No hes right the sandy hook conspiracy is retarded.  It would be one thing if sweeping gun laws where passed nationwide after the incident but the government gained essentially nothing.  Why is it so hard to believe this actually happened? Other then some coincidence bullshit "facts" conspirators pull out of their asses.

       at the very least, it would have been nice to show the suspect at the front door of the school. It would literally put everything to rest.

       On the other hand if there was a picture of him entering the school it would obviously be Photoshoped or an actor.  The whole rest of the community is acting so why not throe in that?

       right so what they are saying with columbine though, is that its more akin to Aurora, where everyone knows the shooting DID happen. It's just the details on there being more than the stated number of shooters...such as black ops handlers. We have the 2 main people though, on camera at the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       With sandy hook, the conspiracy is that no shooting ever in fact took place at all. It's a brazen thing to say someone did something, then not show a picture of him doing it if you have one. My thoughts are, if they DID have one, they would show it. Just like columbine.

       Where was it said they had a big system? Curious.   I was only mentioning many schools have this kind of small system, its more of a peep hole than anything
      </p>
      <p>
       "a visual monitoring system to allow entry."  letter sent to sandy hook parents about the new camera.   The article tries to claim its video security cameras before quoting the letter but clearly its only for entry.  My mom works as a principle in an elementary school that has a crappy tv in the office and a crappy camera out front.  No recording.   They see whos there and buzz them in, unless they look like a psycho or something.  Adam looked like a psycho because they didnt allow entry but he shot through the glass next to the door (evidence in police report).

       There is no video because it wasn't a camera meant to record.

       No you and he are wrong and if you don't want to look at the evidence and make a judgment from that evidence then GTFO you aren't adding shit to the discussion, you are being disruptive and sophomoric. Basically you are just trolling.

       trolling? When YOU are the one presenting homemade YouTube videos as "evidence"? You have been challenged time and time again to present hard evidence (read: NOT a YouTube video you made yourself) to support your theory and you just keep saying "watch the YouTube video!" What part of "that's not evidence" do you not understand? I could make a YouTube right now that shows YOU were the Sandy Hook shooter, but that doesn't make it fucking true.

       The biggest question that needs to be asked is nothing that has been stated in this thread. It is what impact Peter Lanza has with the LIBOR scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       $350 trillion dollars in derivatives were proliferated by LIBOR (London Interbank Offer Rate).

       Peter Lanza is the Tax Director for General Electric. Nothing conspiratorial, but there should be questions asked.

       Realistically wouldnt it be easier to actually brainwash a kid into doing this? If I was in charge of planning this and a subordinate suggested we do a false flag and hire actors to fake a shooting I would force choke him on the spot.

       Another great point. The Sandy Hucksters would like us to believe that the government moved all these "actors" in to free government-gifted homes in Sandy Hook (not a cheap place to live BTW) YEARS before this occurred, and ostensibly paid all the utilities, upkeep and taxes on the "actors" homes, and is STILL doing so, and will likely have to do so for the rest of their lives. Add to that the expense of paying the "actors" salaries at their fake jobs for decades, plus all the other payoffs, hush money and subterfuge that supposedly went into this. All told, we are talking about millions upon millions of dollars in reoccurring expenses.

       ). Sounds like someone in the Gun Control Restriction Conspiracy Creation Department is looking for a new job right about now. LOL

       remember Newtown is not a normal town, its some form of govt town, the CT state prison is there and likely WPP refuge too. a very unusual bump of hundreds of extra house sales in 2012, people out of Newtown.
      </p>
      <p>
       then theres the $0 mortgage or whatever xmas day house sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       the (East Coast) second office for the Church of Satan is in Newtown, assorted masonic lodges, then theres the building known or promoted as SHES, not a normal school building, more likley it was some form of teaching hospital school, the round door windows and the extreme tiling in the corridors, not a single locker to be seen in the hallways either.

       So I found the $0 house "sales" thing interesting too, until I searched the database for other addresses that aren't affiliated with the shooting and found the same entries for them. That made the "official" story of a database migration a lot easier to believe. Unless of course you believe the

       So, you don't have any evidence to support the allegation, and evidence would be hard to come by.  That does not amount to "you're asking me to prove a negative".  Maybe the allegation shouldn't be made if you don't have evidence.  Maybe someone disagreeing with you doesn't automatically make them a "shill".

       I hope that the fraudulent and illegitimate powers that run the United States be exposed for what they truly are and we restore power to the people and the Constitution of the United States. I hope that we absolve and disentangle ourselves from this increasingly globalized world and return to American Isolationism so that we may truly become the leading power on the Earth at this point in our species history. I would hope that we stop promoting absent mindedness and destroying the critical thinking faculty in our citizenry. I would also hope that we shift away from brainwashing the public with trivial dribble that is passed off as "free and entertaining". We have brainwashed our public to the point of no return I fear, this lawsuit whether or not Sandy Hook happened or not is more important than your emotional laden rally against it. If it truly is frivolous and there can be provided evidence this massacre really did happen, then Mr.Shanley shall become a public fool, however to challenge what he believes to be a false hood is the most American and admirable thing he can do.

       You are a fool, and the foley is represented by your refusal to simply look at the evidence. If you do, you would agree, if you still have this same opinion after you view all the evidence, your opinion is paid for and worthless. Its that simple.

       First off you stated no opinions. Obviously from the words you used "hoping" it is more based on feeling and emotion than critically gathered and provided materials. I never claimed to be a patriot and I do not know whether this event actually happened. I have not seen the bodies and frankly most of the reports I have seen, especially in the MSM are virtually identical. The points and inconsistencies that many people who research this proposed event are much more convincing to me, and frankly I would go so far as to demand the US government answer and explain these issues. Wasting resources on this fools folly? Sorry but Sandy Hook is likely to have direct impact on MY 2nd amendment, therefore effects me directly and I WILL not let my privacy be trampled by weak, insecure, and scared sheep and anyone who wants to try can come find me.

       Here's a homework assignment for you: Find out just how many pieces of gun control legislation were proposed as a result of SH, and then find out how many of them were ever actually passed into law.
      </p>
      <p>
       And about that whole "second amendment" thing - that amendment was passed with the intention of making sure that a tyrannical government would not be able to overtake the unarmed citizenry. Sadly, it's not applicable anymore. Not because the government is trustworthy, mind you, but because when that amendment was written, military might had yet to to pass beyond the level of a few muskets, and citizens actually stood a chance. Let's face it: if the National Guard decides to roll tanks down your street tonight, what good do you think that little rifle is
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       going to do you? They'd quickly make an example of you and reduce you, your guns, and your family in the house behind you to a greasy spot on your driveway, and then your second-amendment-happy neighbors would think better of making the same mistake and put down their guns as well. You know it, and I know it.  The truth, my friend, is that
       <em>
        a tyrannical government has ALREADY been able to overtake the un(der)armed citizenry
       </em>
       .
      </p>

       It's too late, buddy. That ship has sailed.

       You have 1 million in the military.

       Just because someone is of fighting age doesn't mean they are fit to take up arms and fight the government. Look around you, at the people you know, and ask yourself - who among you is going to risk losing their family and everything they love to fight the military? And of those, how many will
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       feel that way after watching an entire neighborhood die a gruesome death writing in pain from the effects of Sarin/VX gas?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a huge gamble at best and an unfounded assumption that "much of the military will switch sides". History has shown us that the military will follow orders even when they morally disagree with those orders. Especially when the safety of their own is at stake. Those carrying out these orders will have been promised safety for those they love, bet on it.

       Some things are worth sacrificing for the greater good of the country. If I had to pick my weapons up and fight for my freedom, I would. Regardless of what may happen to myself. It's when you lay down and accept it out of fear that things grow to the point of tyranny that they are now. My life is worth losing of it means that my children and their children get to live free, without oppression from the government.

       200 and a half million people are nothing against half a million professionally trained soldiers that have tanks, bombs, nukes, AFVs, helicopters, planes, UAVs, and other technological weapons, plus allies outside of the US with the same stuff. You're also forgetting that even though there are 200 million people of fighting age, that doesn't mean they'll be in a position to take up a fight, have guns, or even want to fight in the first place.

       An "active shooter" who committed suicide? Does not seem like he would be very active to me. . . Furthermore once the scene was secured why were they EMS not allowed to proceed?

      <p>
       I don't care about the Sydney Siege, I live in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the official story: Somewhere between 10:10-10:20 ( could be noon ) the children were evacuated from the school. If the children were being evacuated then there must be enough evidence to reasonably believe the scene was secured. Yet still the EMS were blocked even during and after this time.
      </p>

       EDIT: 10 Am is the reported evacuation time.

       "In recent years, many top-selling brands — including the 195-year-old Remington Arms, as well as Bushmaster Firearms and DPMS, leading makers of military-style semiautomatics — have quietly passed into the hands of a single private company. It is called the Freedom Group — and it is the most powerful and mysterious force in the American commercial gun industry today." (
