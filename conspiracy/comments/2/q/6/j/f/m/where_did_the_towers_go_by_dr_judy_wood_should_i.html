    <div class="md"><p>Good on you for staying cool.   I say buy it just to support her alone. There must be a little more info in there than all the video presentations.   The fact that she gives the presentations away for free is a clue that it not about the money for her.  This intensity from this person is a joke.  People really care about discrediting her.   The fervor is a big.  They should care less than nothing if it is as dumb as they say.   Her method is very clear.  This is what we see.  Everything.  All these need to be explained.  Be well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so much! The book is on the way! I got it through Amazon. </p>

<p>You are dead on about her doing all the presentations for free. She lost her job for doing this too and likely won&#39;t be able to get a good job because of it. She has even risked her life - her assistant was killed.</p>

<p>people also need to realize that we as a society have been conditioned to have this adversarial dichotomy when groups have opposing views. It&#39;s implanted in us all through our lives. Especially in political issues.  Democrat versus Republican.  And all issues are politicized so we are divided and so no progress is made. It&#39;s no coincidence that in the last presidential race before 9-11 the votes were split right down the middle. I am truly convinced this was something that was planned for decades before the event and dividing the country politically like that was as big a part of that goal as any.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am still chuckling about the GED comment.   Dr. Woods ability to stay focused and not get caught in those types of arguments is so refreshing.  It is so hard to recognize the personal attacks as admissions of weakness and a lack of critical thinking skills.  We are trained to applaud them.  Watch a presidential debate as proof.  It is insulting to the viewer of the discourse as well.  I appreciate what I have seen from her about how to try to think for yourself and observe without drawing a conclusion at that time.  That is helpful in all parts of life.    I think it is clear no one will change people like the one you engaged.  There is one one person we have to answer to.  We need the strength to do it.  Be well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is more evidence. The video shows how there is evidence to show how there is a group of people who have passed down occult knowledge through the ages and the 9-11 and JFK assassination events were tied into this based on this occult information.</p>

<p>It shows that this was all part of an immense plan that has been going on for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>It shows that the highest levels of our government were involved. The old guy doing the interview died a few years ago with elevated levels of arsenic in his system and knew they were poisoning him towards the end of his life. They injected arsenic into his car interior compartment over a long period of time. This old guy was head of the LA division of the FBI at one time. He said there is a good part of the FBI and a bad part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first example they show is of cut beams.. when the firefighters were they they used torches to cut the beams.. to ignore this is beyond comprehension..</p>

<p>They say the concrete was destroyed and material &quot;flung&quot; away from the building.. there was an electromagnetic element of this energy event.. that&#39;s why cars flipped over all around the building.</p>

<p>They claim explosive charges brought the spire down rather than it turning to dust but they show no evidence of explosives.. also.. explosives taking down the building should have made all kinds of explosive noises before the event.. unless we are to believe it was all instantly coordinated which would be as impossible as any other claim.. explosives wouldn&#39;t turn steel to dust anyway.. there would have been significantly more debris than what was there.. but they ignore ALL of this..</p>

<p>They claim thermite caused the cars at the scene to catch fire but there is no evidence to support thermite.. the building would have lit up like a sparkler.. also.. why would there be so much unburned &quot;thermite&quot; that they claim si all through the debris? There is thermite in the debris because thermite is simply powdered steel and aluminum.. which is what you have left when a steel and aluminum building is turned into dust..</p>

<p>They also completely ignore the rest of Dr. Judy Wood&#39;s evidence...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think because the effect wasn&#39;t focused. Think of it like the difference between static electricity and a lightning bolt. The lightning bolt shows what can happen when static electricity is focused.. but in a hurricanes case we never see this effect highly focused as the government did on 9-11. If we had they never could have used the effect. They used this effect because we had no idea about it.. other than John Hutchison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t look like a gravity driven collapse at all. Gravity driven collapsed buildings don&#39;t self destruct at freefall speed. And they don&#39;t completely destroy themselves either. Steel buildings don&#39;t even collapse from fire...</p>

<p>And even if they DID... which isn&#39;t reality.. but hypothetically even if it did it wouldn&#39;t account for the complete absence of material at the site after the towers supposedly collapsed. Dr. Wood shows irrefutable evidence of this.</p>

<p>How could we possibly know the location as well? That&#39;s precisely why they used this method.. because they knew it couldn&#39;t be traced.. so people would be likely to buy the lie they wanted us to buy... they know how easy it is to manipulate and fool the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judy Woods is an idiot.  Hearing her talk made my cringe, she has no clue what she was talking about.</p>

<p>I honestly forgot what she says, doesn&#39;t she mention something about turning the steel into dust?  Does she know how much energy is required to do something like was saying?  Does she understand the basic concept of what happens when you actually &#39;dustify&#39; steel?  If we assumed that the energy weapons came from the sky you would have to assume that the pavement in an 2 mile radius would be a mixture of homogenous rock, flesh and bones.</p>

<p>I actually laughed at the interview with her, she doesn&#39;t even have any calculations.  Buy the book I couldn&#39;t care less, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll laugh at what she wrote while she laughs on her way to the bank.  </p>

<p>This is such a silly comment though... she didn&#39;t say it was done by a known method...  you are naive to think the government isn&#39;t aware of totally unique methods of doing this that requires a minute amount of energy.. she shows in Hutchison&#39;s experiments he has done this.</p>

<p>With the amount of energy required and the &#39;precision&#39; to turn only select steel beams into &#39;dust&#39; while avoiding everything else, is impossible.  She pulled it out of her ass so people like you will spend $50 for a book.</p>

<p>Lets play a game, what happens when you turn steel into &#39;dust&#39; like Judy claims.  It&#39;s verifiable in real-world and a lab, so there&#39;s no smoke and mirrors.</p>

<p>You have no basic critical thinking skills.  Save that $50 and put that towards a GED and attend night classes because there is no  factual argument to support Judy and her claims.  She doesn&#39;t specify anything, all she does is say that it was a DEW in space, shooting the towers (bypassing everything in it&#39;s path besides a few steel beams, and dustifying(?) it. </p>

<p>Again, your avoidance to answer my questions, shows you have no understanding or any science background.  If you consider &#39;science&#39; the ability to pull shit out the air, and ignore the scientific method and take that as fact, than you&#39;re severely misguided.  She would have a much stronger and supportive argument if she actually said it was mind-control that brought it down, because at least you could selectively choose a few beams to take down other than vaporizing all of the Financial District.</p>

<p>There is no known method of dustification of steel.. so we don&#39;t know how much energy is required.. that&#39;s the point! Also, hurricane produce IMMENSE amounts of energy.. an there was a hurricane just off the coast of New York on 9-11... a hurricane the government didn&#39;t bother to want the people of New York about even though it was heading directly for New York for days.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does the DEW selectively choose strategic beams and avoid everything around it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The effect is likely tuned to the materials. And the evidence shows that LARGE MASS objects were affected. So small objects not at the targeted area would not be affected much. This is why you would see the engine blocks of cars melted at the scene yet the body of the car was not as damaged. Also, I suspect they BUILT the WTC precisely for the purpose of this event... which also allowed them to created this effect where only the targeted objects were affected. AND there is something called interferometry. You have one area targeted by multiple energy sources. The area in the interference points is effected and nowhere else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At a molecular level, what happens when you dustify steel? What do you see? Why was this not seen anywhere?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see what we all saw that day... look on the cover of her book and videos she shows. The metal structure of the building was ejecting dust. Maybe it&#39;s some kind of vibrational effect and they are using some effect of matter that is inherent. Something we haven&#39;t seen in nature in an obvious way in our environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What type of DEW?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Wood has discussed the method Hutchison uses.. he uses a static electrical field and interferometry of different directional energy. He used less energy than a average house lamp.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the required energy (equivalent or joules), needed to dustify steel?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t know because we have never seen this effect more. You claim to be an engineer.. study Hutchison&#39;s work and find out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is this satellite still in space? And if it is, what type of orbit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t know if a satellite was necessary. Tesla used a tower to wirelessly transmit energy all over the globe according to him. It could have been a craft as well such as an airship or who knows what. </p>

<p>Once again  are working under the false pretense that some immense amount of energy was necessary... you are buying what your authority figures are telling you without questioning it.

<p>Okay.. here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wood uses an unreliable scaling method to determine how much rubble has been left at the WTC towers and “offers no analytical measurement of the debris present after the WTC tower collapse. Instead, she vaguely and non-quantitatively refers to pictures where it is speculatively assumed to be self evident.”[27]
Seismograph readings were used by Dr. Wood as evidence that much of the debris from the towers never hit the ground. She used an erroneous scaling argument in which the Richter scale reading measured from the collapse of the Kingdome is compared directly to the potential energy of the Kingdome. Based upon this analysis, she then scales the potential energy to obtain a hypothetical Richter scale reading. This hypothetical Richter scale reading is significantly larger than that actually measured from either WTC Tower collapses.
Her analysis is profoundly flawed. Consider the following example. The ML (similar to Richter scale reading) reported for the North Tower is 2.3. The ML from the raw amplitude seismograph readings for WTC 7 is 1.0. Even though the potential energy of the North Tower compared to WTC 7 was about 5 times larger, the energy derived from the Richter scale measurements is 87 times larger. It would be absurd to conclude from this that most of the debris from Building 7 never hit the ground.</p>

I just told you the results of Hutchison&#39;s test which required minute amounts of power. But you are burying your head in the sand about that. </p>
