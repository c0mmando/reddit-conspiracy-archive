       I am a big time Dr. Judy Wood supporter and I have watched every video and interview she has on Youtube and I feel I may have seen all the info she has to offer.. but someone said I should get the book. From the Dr. Judy Wood supporters who have read the book what is your take? Is it worth 50 dollars for someone who is tight on cash?

       Good on you for staying cool.   I say buy it just to support her alone. There must be a little more info in there than all the video presentations.   The fact that she gives the presentations away for free is a clue that it not about the money for her.  This intensity from this person is a joke.  People really care about discrediting her.   The fervor is a big.  They should care less than nothing if it is as dumb as they say.   Her method is very clear.  This is what we see.  Everything.  All these need to be explained.  Be well.

       Thanks so much! The book is on the way! I got it through Amazon.

       You are dead on about her doing all the presentations for free. She lost her job for doing this too and likely won't be able to get a good job because of it. She has even risked her life - her assistant was killed.

       people also need to realize that we as a society have been conditioned to have this adversarial dichotomy when groups have opposing views. It's implanted in us all through our lives. Especially in political issues.  Democrat versus Republican.  And all issues are politicized so we are divided and so no progress is made. It's no coincidence that in the last presidential race before 9-11 the votes were split right down the middle. I am truly convinced this was something that was planned for decades before the event and dividing the country politically like that was as big a part of that goal as any.

       I am still chuckling about the GED comment.   Dr. Woods ability to stay focused and not get caught in those types of arguments is so refreshing.  It is so hard to recognize the personal attacks as admissions of weakness and a lack of critical thinking skills.  We are trained to applaud them.  Watch a presidential debate as proof.  It is insulting to the viewer of the discourse as well.  I appreciate what I have seen from her about how to try to think for yourself and observe without drawing a conclusion at that time.  That is helpful in all parts of life.    I think it is clear no one will change people like the one you engaged.  There is one one person we have to answer to.  We need the strength to do it.  Be well.

       It's like a text book. I think it would be worth it if I hadn't already done an incredible amount of research. The question is  - is it worth it if you have done all the research?

       Energy used as a weapon... yes. That wasn't the only thing that destroyed them though from what I have seen.

       What you have to realize is that what we know in the mainstream and what the people in power know about technology and science are two completely different worlds. And this event - 9-11 - wasn't something they just did on a whim.

       This is more evidence. The video shows how there is evidence to show how there is a group of people who have passed down occult knowledge through the ages and the 9-11 and JFK assassination events were tied into this based on this occult information.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shows that this was all part of an immense plan that has been going on for hundreds of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shows that the highest levels of our government were involved. The old guy doing the interview died a few years ago with elevated levels of arsenic in his system and knew they were poisoning him towards the end of his life. They injected arsenic into his car interior compartment over a long period of time. This old guy was head of the LA division of the FBI at one time. He said there is a good part of the FBI and a bad part.

       It's not disinformation for one... if you have any understanding of science then you would know that based on her evidence.
      </p>

       But the reason I would want to get it is if I can learn anything more about the 9-11 event. This subject ties into other research I am doing.

       The first example they show is of cut beams.. when the firefighters were they they used torches to cut the beams.. to ignore this is beyond comprehension..
      </p>
      <p>
       They say the concrete was destroyed and material "flung" away from the building.. there was an electromagnetic element of this energy event.. that's why cars flipped over all around the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim explosive charges brought the spire down rather than it turning to dust but they show no evidence of explosives.. also.. explosives taking down the building should have made all kinds of explosive noises before the event.. unless we are to believe it was all instantly coordinated which would be as impossible as any other claim.. explosives wouldn't turn steel to dust anyway.. there would have been significantly more debris than what was there.. but they ignore ALL of this..
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim thermite caused the cars at the scene to catch fire but there is no evidence to support thermite.. the building would have lit up like a sparkler.. also.. why would there be so much unburned "thermite" that they claim si all through the debris? There is thermite in the debris because thermite is simply powdered steel and aluminum.. which is what you have left when a steel and aluminum building is turned into dust..
      </p>
      <p>
       They also completely ignore the rest of Dr. Judy Wood's evidence...

       It wasn't an electromagnetic blast but an electromagnetic event. From what Hutchison's tests have shown it requires a minute amount of energy to create these effects.. so electrical devices shouldn't be damaged from the effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Judy Wood shows that Hurricanes create these same effects.. and there just so happened to be a hurricane right off the coast of New York during this event. And hurricanes don't destroy electronics when they come around cities.

       I think because the effect wasn't focused. Think of it like the difference between static electricity and a lightning bolt. The lightning bolt shows what can happen when static electricity is focused.. but in a hurricanes case we never see this effect highly focused as the government did on 9-11. If we had they never could have used the effect. They used this effect because we had no idea about it.. other than John Hutchison.

       It doesn't matter where it originated... this is the problem with Dr. Judy Wood's critics... not knowing where the effect originated doesn't change the evidence of the effect...

       That's like saying just because we don't know who shot someone they couldn't have actually been shot.. even though the evidence shows emphatically they were shot.

       I don't believe the thermite hypothesis, by the way. There haven't been any tests that have confirmed the presence of such anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just don't get how an energy weapon destroying a building looks exactly like a gravity-driven collapse and you can side with the hypothesis that utilizes unproven technology from a mystery location by a mysterious entity.

       It doesn't look like a gravity driven collapse at all. Gravity driven collapsed buildings don't self destruct at freefall speed. And they don't completely destroy themselves either. Steel buildings don't even collapse from fire...
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if they DID... which isn't reality.. but hypothetically even if it did it wouldn't account for the complete absence of material at the site after the towers supposedly collapsed. Dr. Wood shows irrefutable evidence of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could we possibly know the location as well? That's precisely why they used this method.. because they knew it couldn't be traced.. so people would be likely to buy the lie they wanted us to buy... they know how easy it is to manipulate and fool the public.

       by asking that question you show that you don't know the basics of the event and that you just follow what you were told by MSM/gov .. its been 13 years man, if you don't know that there were a lot of unexplained anomolies (like lack of debris, lack of office equip, etc..) then you shouldn't be here trying to debunk anything.

       Judy Woods is an idiot.  Hearing her talk made my cringe, she has no clue what she was talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly forgot what she says, doesn't she mention something about turning the steel into dust?  Does she know how much energy is required to do something like was saying?  Does she understand the basic concept of what happens when you actually 'dustify' steel?  If we assumed that the energy weapons came from the sky you would have to assume that the pavement in an 2 mile radius would be a mixture of homogenous rock, flesh and bones.
      </p>

       I actually laughed at the interview with her, she doesn't even have any calculations.  Buy the book I couldn't care less, I'm sure you'll laugh at what she wrote while she laughs on her way to the bank.

       With the amount of energy required and the 'precision' to turn only select steel beams into 'dust' while avoiding everything else, is impossible.  She pulled it out of her ass so people like you will spend $50 for a book.

       Lets play a game, what happens when you turn steel into 'dust' like Judy claims.  It's verifiable in real-world and a lab, so there's no smoke and mirrors.

       You have no basic critical thinking skills.  Save that $50 and put that towards a GED and attend night classes because there is no  factual argument to support Judy and her claims.  She doesn't specify anything, all she does is say that it was a DEW in space, shooting the towers (bypassing everything in it's path besides a few steel beams, and dustifying(?) it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, your avoidance to answer my questions, shows you have no understanding or any science background.  If you consider 'science' the ability to pull shit out the air, and ignore the scientific method and take that as fact, than you're severely misguided.  She would have a much stronger and supportive argument if she actually said it was mind-control that brought it down, because at least you could selectively choose a few beams to take down other than vaporizing all of the Financial District.

       There is no known method of dustification of steel.. so we don't know how much energy is required.. that's the point! Also, hurricane produce IMMENSE amounts of energy.. an there was a hurricane just off the coast of New York on 9-11... a hurricane the government didn't bother to want the people of New York about even though it was heading directly for New York for days.

       The effect is likely tuned to the materials. And the evidence shows that LARGE MASS objects were affected. So small objects not at the targeted area would not be affected much. This is why you would see the engine blocks of cars melted at the scene yet the body of the car was not as damaged. Also, I suspect they BUILT the WTC precisely for the purpose of this event... which also allowed them to created this effect where only the targeted objects were affected. AND there is something called interferometry. You have one area targeted by multiple energy sources. The area in the interference points is effected and nowhere else.

       You see what we all saw that day... look on the cover of her book and videos she shows. The metal structure of the building was ejecting dust.

        Wood uses an unreliable scaling method to determine how much rubble has been left at the WTC towers and “offers no analytical measurement of the debris present after the WTC tower collapse. Instead, she vaguely and non-quantitatively refers to pictures where it is speculatively assumed to be self evident.”[27]
Seismograph readings were used by Dr. Wood as evidence that much of the debris from the towers never hit the ground. She used an erroneous scaling argument in which the Richter scale reading measured from the collapse of the Kingdome is compared directly to the potential energy of the Kingdome. Based upon this analysis, she then scales the potential energy to obtain a hypothetical Richter scale reading. This hypothetical Richter scale reading is significantly larger than that actually measured from either WTC Tower collapses.
Her analysis is profoundly flawed. Consider the following example. The ML (similar to Richter scale reading) reported for the North Tower is 2.3. The ML from the raw amplitude seismograph readings for WTC 7 is 1.0. Even though the potential energy of the North Tower compared to WTC 7 was about 5 times larger, the energy derived from the Richter scale measurements is 87 times larger. It would be absurd to conclude from this that most of the debris from Building 7 never hit the ground.

       The ignorance you displayed in your last post is mind boggling.

      <p>
       It's funny how you take Wood's critics comments as gospel but claim her claims are unsubstantiated.. what makes the person you quoted more reliable than Dr. Wood. Also, Judy Wood has since changed her stance on the claim of an orbital platform.. you'd know that if you actually looked at her work instead of mindlessly parroting your superiors...

       And no there isn't any known amount of energy necessary to "dustify" steel.. we don't know by what process the steel was dustified.. you are so brainless you claim it had to be done by explosion.. we don't know that. I just told you the results of Hutchison's test which required minute amounts of power. But you are burying your head in the sand about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also claimed the concrete was ejecting dust in the videos.. the outer shell of the buildings was made entirely of steel.. not concrete.. so your claims are dead wrong.

       They say the concrete was destroyed and material "flung" away from the building.. there was an electromagnetic element of this energy event.. that's why cars flipped over all around the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim explosive charges brought the spire down rather than it turning to dust but they show no evidence of explosives.. also.. explosives taking down the building should have made all kinds of explosive noises before the event.. unless we are to believe it was all instantly coordinated which would be as impossible as any other claim.. explosives wouldn't turn steel to dust anyway.. there would have been significantly more debris than what was there.. but they ignore ALL of this..
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim thermite caused the cars at the scene to catch fire but there is no evidence to support thermite.. the building would have lit up like a sparkler.. also.. why would there be so much unburned "thermite" that they claim si all through the debris? There is thermite in the debris because thermite is simply powdered steel and aluminum.. which is what you have left when a steel and aluminum building is turned into dust..
