       And just like that, you've proven my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiding behind your list of "criteria", you've allowed yourself to completely avoid any skepticism of your methods. See, my being a shill or not (spoiler: I'm not) has nothing to do with the point I was making. If you were actually intellectually honest you should be able to defend the legitimacy of your post, regardless of whether I am a shill or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead you simply discount anything I said because you went through my history and decided I was a shill based on bullshit criteria. You use anything you can as an excuse discount differing opinions. That isn't how you determine actual truth. That is how you close your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is the truly sad part... you view yourself as a seeker of truth and me as some disinformation agent when in reality you have it exactly backwards. And of course, you'll never understand this, because you've already decided that I am the enemy.

       How is any of that conclusive proof that I am a shill? I have recently become interested in conspiracy theories and have decided to begin posting my opinions in this subreddit in response to what I saw as bad information and bad science. People aren't shills because they disagree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like I said, whether I am a shill or not means absolutely nothing. Your opinions and beliefs should stand on fact alone. Prove to me the accuracy of the source you posted. The article appears to claim that one can identify a shill with no actual hard evidence, just through examination of their words. How was this determined to be effective. How many actually proven shill's (through other, more concrete methods like leaked documentation or admissions) comment history was this tested on to prove its effectiveness?
      </p>

       Stop building walls against differing opinions like a coward.

       You say that as if I care. Defend your views. Show me why your article is effective at exposing shills. I am trying to engage you into actually defending your beliefs and not closing your mind to opposing ideas. I could give two shits whether you think I am a shill.

       Edit: I'm reminded of a time I went to some shitty metalworking shop to sell some old plates.  It was horribly nasty, people were dirty.  I walked into their office through a cloud of smoke.  My nerves were already getting fiesty.  On the secretary's desk was that standard "You catch more flies with honey."

       My integrity was insulted the moment users in this thread insisted I was a shill for questioning their methods of determining what a shill actually is. Considering this, all I've really done in this thread is ask for evidence in the face of continuing insults. Then, I make some observations stemming from my frustration with users deciding evidence wasn't as important as protecting confirmation bias, and you have the balls to say that I am a dickhead that needs to show more respect? What about the user calling me a shill? Not only is that an insult, it is against the rules of this subreddit.

      <p>
       Your intentions when making this thread may not have been to start a witch hunt against skepticism, but that is exactly what it did.

      <p>
       So please, don't accuse me of being disrespectful if you aren't going to point that same gaze on the people who happen to agree with you.

       No, you are right. Calling someone a shill isn't insulting. All they are saying is that you have so little integrity that you are willing to lie and distort information and be complicit in any number of horrible conspiracies/events for the purposes of payment. Nothing insulting there. There is also no reason to be mad when they use this baseless accusation to discredit anything you say and ignore any genuine questions, even after you state multiple times that you are just looking for better evidence.

       I am trying to get the other user to describe the process they use to determine what users are shills. A link was provided that listed a variety of "techniques" that "shills" use. I was hoping the user could detail how these characteristics specifically applied to shills and how many independently verified shills were used to confirm the accuracy of the list.

       It'd be very interesting to see a comparison of the variability of scores on certain topics in the new queue to see if specific set of topics is statistically more controversial than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if you could demonstrate that statistically that the vote counts do go haywire outside the normal variability of new reddit submissions, you still have the problem of attribution to contend with. A lot of conspiracy theorists downvote reptilian/submissions that can be classified as racist. Do those downvoters qualify as shills?

       No. Some topics I agree are very controversial, yet even the lizard posts don't bring as much of a down vote flood as the posts on GMO's or Palestine, for example. Why would 30 users down vote a GMO post within seconds, without any justifiable comments? I know, there is no 'hard' proof, but being here for many years now just about everyday you can see when a trend is fishy.

       That's the thing though; there easily could be hard proof. Apply the scientific method, collect data. Do Students T-test or Pearson's Chi-square or whatever hypothesis test is appropriate for the data you collect.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, present your findings. That would be incredibly compelling. You could show beyond the shadow of the doubt that certain topics have a higher intrinsic variability in score.

       Right, so not shills then. Just people who disagree with you. Language certainly is fun when we can make words mean whatever we want them to.

       You do realize what you're asking isn't feasible, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire idea behind a shill is that they're disposable internet voices.  To
       <strong>
        PROVE
       </strong>
       someone is shilling would require tracing their location, and really digging to find any money trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything from the "ex-shill" is true, nothing about the job is permanent or paper trail-able.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that we need to catch a shill is silly.  Its easy as fuck to see people with an agenda to spread.  Does calling them out really accomplish anything? Nope.  But they're a permanent reminder that the system is gamed against
       <em>
        actual peoples

       favor.

      <p>
       Are you implying they don't exist?

      <p>
       Edit: I guess I'm not sure why you're even defending the idea of keeping your head in the sand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2:  The term has evolved.  The only people who would prefer it to be strictly used for "paid agenda pushers" are shills themselves. And that's real.

       Nonsense, haven't you seen the Congress Wiki edit twitter feeds and the like? In any case, if it's too much work for you to prove someone is a shill, don't say.

       I do however think that most all of the people that fritter away their time posting from a skeptical perspective (myself included) can't be classified as shills if one cares anything about the meaning of the word.

       So you really are saying that anyone that disagrees with you is by definition a shill? Well done with that tautology.

       I don't see your reasoning for arguing.

       What I said stands.  Its a reality of the world we live in.

       And for your signoff, no, I didn't say that.

       My post was to point out that attempting to seek them out is not feasible.  To be aware they exist, to be aware of their tactics. That is the goal.

       Did I say its too hard to find them? No.  Could I do it? Probably not.  Does this mean everything I said is invalid? I don't think so.

       Edit: For real this "So you're saying people who disagree are shills?" Is such a tiring trope.

       My reason for arguing is apparently, your arguments can pass as being rational and evidence based, which is demonstrably false. I generally think that's pretense for calling someone out.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, if not a tautology, what then would you say is the accurate, evolved, and modern definition of "shill" is? I've consulted Mencken and he's uncharacteristically mum on the subject.

       Unfortunately the vaccine shill crowd on reddit is still VERY strong.  Despite the fact that the CDC's top scientist blew the whistle on the vaccine-autism connection, and the WHO was caught red handed peddling vaccines with infertility chemicals.  Not a single mention of either of these massive stories on mainstream media.. it's scary how much control the pharma industry has.

       Sadly, I couldn't get hired as a US government shill since I'm Canadian. Because of this, I missed out on all that extra income and have to live a regular middle class life instead of the posh luxuries I could have had, and I didn't get the girl because she wanted someone who could give her the finer things in life. But thanks for pouring salt in that wound man.

       I used to think vaccines were OK, until people like you come along and make them seem like something to be avoided at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are sold on vaccines, go ahead and get them. If they are as effective as you think, you need not worry about catching anything from those who dont consume the vaccine koolaid

       It's as simple as that.  These things do cause damage to some people.  That is a fact that you can not deny.  So instead of trying so hard to be on the "right side of the issue", perhaps you should know what you are talking about next time.

       Reasonable precautions are not an admission of guilt.  The point isn't that vaccines are 100% safe.  Nothing is 100% safe.  But the vast majority of people don't have a bad reaction to them and their benefits greatly outweigh the risks.

       There is a difference between someone who understands a couple things can go wrong and someone who calls others "fools" out of their own willful ignorance.  Not only that, but if the number of incidences were so low, then there would be no need for a program such as the one I listed above.

       You lack any wisdom or knowledge on how the trial, peer review, test and study systems work.

      <p>
       Let's say I own Pfizer (I don't...but let's just say!). I hire scientist (Means I PAY THEM) to do the trials of a newly developed vaccine. I pay 1 million dollars for the application fee, get a 30 million dollar write off for the trials and then submit my data from the trials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I have 3 people on the review board that works for me as speakers, or has worked for me at a high level position in the past and in the future, there is an easy passing and acceptance of my "trials".
      </p>
      <p>
       APPROVED!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       You're dumb as a rock because the trials, test and studies are completely on the "Honor" system within FDA. They have worked for or currently get paid, funded or perked for the major pharma companies.

        Let's say I own Pfizer (I don't...but let's just say!). I hire scientist (Means I PAY THEM) to do the trials of a newly developed vaccine. I pay 1 million dollars for the application fee, get a 30 million dollar write off for the trials and then submit my data from the trials.
Since I have 3 people on the review board that works for me as speakers, or has worked for me at a high level position in the past and in the future, there is an easy passing and acceptance of my "trials".

       In late September of 2008, Melamine was found in Baby Formula. Here is what FDA stated: " A review done by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was
       <strong>
        unable to determine any level
       </strong>
       of melamine in infant formula that would be safe, the agency said Friday. " (
       <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/71507/no-amount-of-melamine-safe-in-baby-formula-fda">
        http://www.law360.com/articles/71507/no-amount-of-melamine-safe-in-baby-formula-fda
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy who owned the factory in China was executed over it. Fast forward a couple months and US manufactures were caught with it in their formula. FDA stated: "
       <strong>
        The levels that we are detecting are extremely low
       </strong>
       ," said Dr. Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. "They should not be changing the diet. If they've been feeding a particular product, they should continue to feed that product. That's in the best interest of the baby."
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Now, before your dumbass states that it was higher levels, go look up the data, I have wasted enough time already on turds like you. Look it up your damn self lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why did FDA suddenly change their mind? From "Food and Drug Administration was unable to determine any level of melamine in infant formula that would be safe" to Keep feeding your baby, even though we just stated otherwise a couple of months ago.

       Dr. Stephen Sundlof now has a great couple of jobs, working with Federal Grants and working on "Policy" projects. That means he is part of a "Lobby" effort to help protect his donors. Do some digging and see exactly how it works with ALL of these pricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paste his name in Google and the names of the major pharmaceutical companies and you can see all of the "Favors" he does for them. You can also find his high dollar speaking engagements paid for by major pharmaceutical companies. He is a sellout and part of the controlled medical community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if modern medicine is so great, why must they "control" the science, conversations and policy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Stephen Sundlof is not the only one, I can show blatant conflicts of interest of hundreds of these guys doing the exact same thing. It's your job, just as it was mine, to look up all of this information and learn for yourself.

       Then why do or did you go to school if someone provided you everything? Your world view is what makes you such a blind douche bag.

       As far as education, I have  G.E.D. but have many (about 30 people) with masters, doctorates and everything below working for me, a couple from Harvard, and others from lesser ( In your mind anyway) colleges, so who's the stupid one here hotshot? I authorize their paychecks. lol!

       I have to deal with FDA on a consistent basis and know very well how they operate. I Import, and have to deal with them on every single product I develop, produce, manufacture and sell both online and in brick and mortar businesses. I know what I am talking about, you're reciting what your brainwashed professors tell you. Just remember, they were brainwashed like you and are parroting what they learned to you...even if it's wrong.

       The US health industry is run by bribes and the proverbial "revolving doors", they heal nothing, they treat symptoms, while using dangerous drugs they concocted to do it. Emergency medicine is the only thing they do right, the rest is all political, corruption, lobbying and paid off NGO's and "Foundations", all staffed by the same people who are corrupt.

       Sorry, asking someone to back up their claim is grounds for being a shill? I did look it up, I'm not very concerned seeing as I've gotten vaccines all my life and I don't have autism. It's my personal belief that the chemicals found in Roundup contribute to the rising rates of autism, not vaccines.

       i'd like to thank some of the mods for keeping their favorite shills around sometimes for months and months, adding entertainment and distraction, bravo!

       we can spot them within a few posts or a week at most but somehow it takes 3-6months to ban some of them? amazing work.

       Not to play devils advocate, but just banning someone at first suggestion would lead to this sub being a ghost town.  If I were a mod, it would at least take some time to investigate.

       6 months sounds crazy long.  I can MAYBE see 3 months to see if a pattern arises in their posting habits.

       not talking about the "first suggestion", it really does not take long to spot a poster with an agenda and then just a short amount of time more to confirm it. 2weeks is more than enough if they post everyday or so. many of our regular shills cycle accounts though, so you only see each name every other week or so. even so, i spot them, i know them, if the mods are paying attention they should too.

       I personally enjoy when their argument breaks down to insulting the other party.  Can't hold up much of a better sign to show you've lost the argument when you resort to personal attacks instead of bolstering their position.

       We are disagreeing on your interpretation of what I was conveying? Even after I attempted to clarify.  Thats a little odd.  I was referring to the mentality of paid opposition.  They clearly aren't elites so why would they shill....greed &amp; self preservation much the same way that house negro's did as they did.  I was only using the term/name that the great Malcom X used.  See?

       I completely understand what you mean when you say "House negro."

      <p>
       I understand that your usage isn't inherently racist.

       However, I am of the opinion we can find a better term to encompass
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       of those ignorant defenders that doesn't stem from a term meant for one race.

       for being terrible at identifying shills. It provides some wonderful comedy. I found it hilarious when one user legitimately thought I was at an air force base with some other user plotting our next comments in this sub, when I was actually killing time in my Immunology class.

       I'm superior over the dumb users. Plenty of people in this sub seem intelligent and have good conversations. But I'm definitely more sane than a dude who assumes I work at an air force base as a shill after reading like 4 posts I made in his thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the average conspiracy theorist most definitely thinks they are superior over the average American. This sub is constantly full of posts like "why doesn't the average American wake up? Why are we the only ones who understand? Why don't people think critically like us? Herp derp everyone else is blind sheep".

       Am I wrong? Definitely more likely that he's a troll rather than getting paid to copy and post the same anti jew rant in every thread.

       his name is structured basicailly the same as the owner of the sub he keeps "shilling" for with every post.  I'd say troll of the kind to make the sub appear anti-semetic, with his own subreddit even so he can link in pure utter racist trash without having anyone moderating it.

       I am trying to get the other user to describe the process they use to determine what users are shills. A link was provided that listed a variety of "techniques" that "shills" use. I was hoping the user could detail how these characteristics specifically applied to shills and how many independently verified shills were used to confirm the accuracy of the list.
      </p>
      <p>
       I received no such data, instead only more accusations.
