       I only just picked this one up, so a little back story is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was watching one of those Air Crash investigation videos on YouTube and it mentioned the story of Mohammed Atta's luggage.  The official narrative says - Atta's flight to Boston was delayed, which is why the baggage never made it onto the deadly flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sat and thought about it for a while, there just seemed something wrong with this story.  So, I went and read up on the official story and it turns out my hunch was 100% correct.  Yes his flight was delayed.  However, his flight to Boston was on the 9th of September, two full days prior to catching the plane he'd supposedly slam into the tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this luggage which conveniently contained a hand written will and notes on why he was about to slam a plane into the twin towers, was checked in on the 11th September.  This luggage is yet another very obvious plant.  Just as his miracle passport was also an obvious plant.

       Of all the 9/11 lies and absurdities, the passport one is the biggest LOL moment when I hear people say they believe it happened.  Its as if seconds before slamming a jet into a building at hundreds of MPH, he opened a window and tossed it out so someone could find it.  Mind you, it survived the explosion, inferno, and the eventual collapse.  I'm amazed that sheep still believe this filth.

       Well, it's an irrelevant to the topic really  and a genuinely bad comparison, since no matter how absurd you may think of the official story, find a piece of paper after a giant explosion is not a strange occurrence and has happened everytime anything gets blown up.

       So, you believe his luggage miraculously never made it onto the plane, despite him checking in well within time?  Not only that but his passport also survived.  Not only that but he was seen out heavily drinking and partying several times (hardly the devout Muslim he's purported to be). Not only that but all three towers, including one which only has localized fires and mid section structural damage, all fell at free fall speed.  Oh and the people who put sixteen times the normal amount of put options on the airlines before 9/11 - there was no reason for the options, nobody expected the airline to under perform.  There are a million questions that have never been answered.  You must at least be a little suspicious?

      <p>
       considering no accurate estimate has even been given to how long they took to fall, this is bullshit- and that there's a considerable amount of evidence indicating the time taken was considerably greater than "free fall speed, i also call that bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor does the assumption that
       <em>
        even if
       </em>
       the building did in fact fall at freefall speed- actually lead to anything other than "it fell at free fall speed". Anything further is a gross extrapolation.

       Thing occurring contrary to an expected outcome shouldn't lead anyone to take such a great leap of faith that there was some colluded intent- especially when a plausible, simplistic and well-recieved explanation is given toward the unexpected outcome.  This isn't occam's razor. This is occam's rusty bludgeoning tool.

       It's pretty laughable when you pass off attempts to address points made. Especially when you like to drone on about "knowing things". It's easy to trick yourself into thinking you're open-minded when you stick your fingers in your ears and shout SHILL at the top of your lungs everytime someone addresses you.

       So when i want to think about how strongly i feel about an event, i look to alternate interpretations to see how well founded my beliefs are.

       Just because some one doesn't understand or eloquently express an idea is a woefully insufficient reason to dismiss it in my opinion, and is in fact the aim of what we call disinformation: things like lizard people and "the moon isn't real" turn away people like you who, while having your head on straight, may not always think critically about a subject, particularly if it is couched in such pants-on-head-retarded rhetoric.

       You're correct about this, but this wasn't the basis of my argument.

       It
       <em>

       however, reason enough to believe the people who say these things have no idea what they're talking about. Which, considering they're the only ones saying it- seems like a good reason to be doubtful.

      <p>
       To expand upon this, it's not about doubting the water cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see the rain. I know if i need an umbrella. No one (well there are some probably) is questioning "the towers came down" or "jfk was shot" or "there is a moon". Just like no one would be questioning that it rains.
      </p>
      <p>
       If i want a deeper understanding of the water cycle i start questioning it. I know what is involved in this. I've had to defend a thesis. I've had to explore every single angle contrary to what i was trying to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in my search for "alternate" ideas about how water moves around the atmosphere i come across only unsupported suppositions, paranoid coincidences, and really nothing resembling a platform it suggests to me there are no alternate ideas.  I'm not dismissing it because they were poorly formatted (though that doesn't help), i'm dismissing it because the
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       hold up to scrutiny. Simply
       <em>
        saying

       something doesn't make it legitimate.  There isn't
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       kid of good counter-argument, well written or otherwise. It's purely a mishmash of misunderstandings, poor interpretations and bad logic.  I've  watched every youtube video, read every copypasta, seen all the arguments time and time again- and i read this forum a lot. That is me putting forward a concerted effort to "learn" and all it does is continually reinforce my view.

       I guess that's fair, though I'd gripe about using "don't know" rather than "have no idea" (still rather hesitant to throw that baby out with the bath water).

       And yes, David Icke and his passionate followers literally believe there is no moon (or that it's hollow, depending on the year).  I guess technically everyone who dabbles in simulation theory at least considers it possible (since nothing "exists").

      <p>
       I'm not sure really. At least in the case of 9/11 it's a case of semantics. Yes, they certainly used the event as causus belli- and yes there was push to get involved in the middle east before the events. Whether that's a conspiracy technically, literally or casually is up for debate (and i don't really have an opinion either way). The whole WMD was pretty jaw droppingly dumb, moreso in retrospect- i think that could be called a conspiracy. Certainly on rummy's end.

      <p>
       And of course, things like COINTELLIPRO and all that jazz- i'm not sitting here pretending the government is perfect or that people in power love transparency.

       sure, you could just keep tacking on arguments based on the weakest of evidence (or lack of evidence) but i don't that makes those arguments salient. The uncertainty principle is important, but there's a point where it becomes counter productive; one has to play it carefully against the principle of falsifiability. The point is- continually pushing forward using some spotty data as "evidence" for something happening isn't really the best of logic. The smallest inconsistency or unexpected occurrence suddenly becomes the smoking gun. This happens constantly. They found his passport! They found some bbc mistaking "going to fall" for "had fallen"! Mohamed Atta wasn't a devout muslim! Sept 11th is the same date George Bush Sr gave the New World Order speech! Checkmate shills!

       You don't need to, i'm aware of them. And even the most legitimate isn't really evidence of much beyond itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's also important to remember that all of that aside, there's still an event which cost the lives of 3000 americans, was a
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       breach of  security and undoubtedly one of the most important events of history in the last 50 years... and frankly just a really confusing event. Chaos alone should be reason to dismiss a lot.   Even the most perfect, transparent utopia might issue some incongruent statemtents and prefer some elements to remain undisclosed. That fact in itself again, isn't evidence of anything really.

      <p>
       again addressing uncertainty, you're correct i guess. I'm not entirely sure of the methodology involved in acquiring an appropriate confidence value for saying "these things happened". But not every theory is codified with P values.  Instead volume of evidence and the legitimacy of that evidence (and how well it holds up to criticism) are crucial to forming scientific consensus.

       The story behind Atta goes deep. He was being tracked through the US under suspicion of participating in the 1995 OKC bombing in an operation called Able Danger. This is described in the book Operation Dark Heart by Lt. Col. Tony Schaeffer and brilliantly covered by Daniel Hopsicker in his book Welcome to Terrorland.

       right, and the first and only time in history is the only sample we're working, therefore we can't really tell how the outcome stacks up against others.

       discrepancy between observed and expected outcomes is not a logical reason to dismiss something. 10,000 years of human civilization demonstrates unexpected outcomes.

       Both towers falling in identical and inexplicable fashion, followed by a third, unstruck tower collapsing at a rate indistinguishable from free fall acceleration is impossible. You are either a fool or a liar to believe otherwise.

       I don't think you understand how this matters, regardless of its apparent implication in taking down the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people say things like "this has never happened before" or "isn't it
       <em>
        strange
       </em>
       that it happened this way?? And then we see all kinds of comparisons and what-ifs....
      </p>
      <p>
       Details matter. Osama Bin Laden farting twice at breakfast in pakistan matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       When things happen you have to look at everything that happened. Structural damage- even
       <em>
        superficial
       </em>
       structural damage is A Thing That Happened. It didn't take down the buildings but it
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       matters in scope.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work in a field that demands a fair amount of rigorous attention to detail im creating reproducible experiments. If  we were to leave something out like "some superficial damage" and attempt to compare findings we would be laughed out of the lab. That is inexcusable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is it matters, even if it imparted a single centimeter of sway  or a half degree of temperature change.

       Oh, you prefer the scientific, rational and logical approach. That is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one is short and sweet. You do have a scientific background, don't you? Addition, substraction, multiplication, division, maybe even integrals? Here you go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google "Mechanics of Progressive Collapse - Learning from World Trade Center and Building Demolitions" [sic!] by Zdeněk Pavel Bažant (who is, according to Wikipedia, widely recognized as the world's leading authority on these matters: material sciences, scaling behaviour, rigid body mechanics), his fellow ASCE and Matthieu Verdure.
       <a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/466.pdf">
        Open it
       </a>
       . Read the first four pages and understand them.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the fourth page, it says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As W[g] was, for the WTC, greater than W[p] by an order of magnitude, acceleration of collapse from one story to the next was ensured.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       W[g] is the gravitational potential energy = m * g * h (mass * gravitational acceleration * distance between ground and center of mass -- IOW, all of its available momentum), W[p] is the potential, internal, tensile energy doing all the "virtual work" of keeping the mass up = F[c] * h (the average crushing force * distance it acts on; or, more precisely: the area under (integral of) the load-displacement curve F(u)).
      </p>
      <p>
       What this peer-reviewed paper says is that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed because
       <em>
        W[g] was roughly three times greater than W[p]
       </em>
       .
       <strong>
        Under these circumstances, it is no wonder they fell down - it was a miracle it was standing up in the first place!
       </strong>
       Traditionally, you will want your building (the Great Pyramid, the Eiffel Tower, the BOK Tower) to satisfy W[p] = W[g] * FoS, with FoS &gt;&gt; 1 -- because
       <em>
        if FoS &lt; 1, collapse is inevitable
       </em>
       . This is the reason why, as a rule of thumb,
       <em>
        partial
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        disproportional
       </em>
       progressive collapses occur on a regular basis and are well-understood, and why
       <em>
        total progressive gravitational-driven top-down collapse
       </em>
       only happened twice in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to make one of two outlandish assumptions now.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Twins were engineered that way (W[p] = W[g] / 3) and still withstood subtropical hurricanes, office fires, half-ton-TNT-bombs in the basement and airliner impacts, and a model of these buildings would - absent explosives - energetically look like an ingeniuous Rube-Goldberg-machine with springs and levers (which is why to this day, there is not one single scientific or physical model of the collapse).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Twins were engineered like any other building (W[p] = W[g] * 2), and in the Δt between onset and end of the collapse, more than 86% (ΔFoS = 2 - 5/3) of W[p] "magically" vanished.
        </p>

      <p>
       what a lovely and condescending statement, already in the opening paragraph. this really speaks well for you.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Google "Mechanics of Progressive Collapse - Learning from World Trade Center and Building Demolitions" [sic!] by Zdeněk Pavel Bažant (who is, according to Wikipedia, widely recognized as the world's leading authority on these matters: material sciences, scaling behaviour, rigid body mechanics), his fellow ASCE and Matthieu Verdure. Open it. Read the first four pages and understand them.
At the end of the fourth page, it says:
As W[g] was, for the WTC, greater than W[p] by an order of magnitude, acceleration of collapse from one story to the next was ensured.
W[g] is the gravitational potential energy = m * g * h (mass * gravitational acceleration * distance between ground and center of mass -- IOW, all of its available momentum), W[p] is the potential, internal, tensile energy doing all the "virtual work" of keeping the mass up = F[c] * h (the average crushing force * distance it acts on; or, more precisely: the area under (integral of) the load-displacement curve F(u)).
What this peer-reviewed paper says is that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed because W[g] was roughly three times greater than W[p]. Under these circumstances, it is no wonder they fell down - it was a miracle it was standing up in the first place! Traditionally, you will want your building (the Great Pyramid, the Eiffel Tower, the BOK Tower) to satisfy W[p] = W[g] * FoS, with FoS &gt;&gt; 1 -- because if FoS &lt; 1, collapse is inevitable. This is the reason why, as a rule of thumb, partial and disproportional progressive collapses occur on a regular basis and are well-understood, and why total progressive gravitational-driven top-down collapse only happened twice in history.
You have to make one of two outlandish assumptions now.
The Twins were engineered that way (W[p] = W[g] / 3) and still withstood subtropical hurricanes, office fires, half-ton-TNT-bombs in the basement and airliner impacts, and a model of these buildings would - absent explosives - energetically look like an ingeniuous Rube-Goldberg-machine with springs and levers (which is why to this day, there is not one single scientific or physical model of the collapse).
The Twins were engineered like any other building (W[p] = W[g] * 2), and in the Δt between onset and end of the collapse, more than 86% (ΔFoS = 2 - 5/3) of W[p] "magically" vanished.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Cool. A bunch of words and numbers that don't really arrive at much of a conclusion on their own. Your "assumptions" are your own. Even a cursory investigation of Bazant's work as a structural engineer would show how much he focuses on decreases load strength over time, decreasing material quality and increasing instability over time- which of course has considerable impact on the comparisons between "How the were built" and "How the were later", which seems to be a keypoint in your foggy understanding.

       And after being inespected, quite rigorously by a lot of people, the same thing keeps being returned.   That the leap to something fishy going on is entirely a projection and a gross extrapolation biased heavily by what is probably paranoia, anti-establishmentism or whatever other pre-existing agenda.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Please pay attention. The official story is that the towers were, during collapse, three times heavier than the structure could support, and that this is the reason why, after initiation, collapse was
       <em>
        "inevitable"
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That is also the reason why there are only pretty computer animations, because nowadays everyone can download Blender, a physics engine plugin, code a tower and tinker away with the parameters until it collapses or floats into the clouds and vomits rainbows and call it a "simulation" or a "model", which is precisely what NIST and Purdue did, which you cannot deny and I cannot prove because the data is not open source for very obvious reasons, and by virtue of being a black box cannot be replicated, verified or falsified, and therefor is
       <em>
        unscientific
       </em>
       by the very definition of the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is also the reason why you will not be able to build a physical model of the collapse without springs and levers or something dangling from your ceiling, and why not even a house of cards will exhibit progressive top-down collapse, and most of your domino towers will fall sideways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because building something that is three times heavier than it can support so it can fall through and out of itself is a frigging feat and a proof for intent, an intelligent balancing act, not the result of an accident, and all you can do is type words with no meaning if you try to disprove this statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you won't even try, because what is really happening right now is that some guy in a faraway land is taking his precious time to explain to you the official conspiracy theory with its own words, mathematics and models. The official conspiracy theory is that there were no explosives, that the towers were sound structures apart from the zones locally damaged by the impacts, and that a 2 mile high tower forged from adamantium would have exhibited the very same features had a failure of the sixth floor from the top initiated global collapse - if, and only if, W[g] &gt; W[p] by an order of magnitude, and only if the mechanism is damn well lubricated and not accidentally snags and locks and brakes the descent. It would be too embarrassing if it looked like one of those demolition

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The energetic signatures and collapse features of WTC 1 &amp; 2 exhibit, even according to the official conspiracy theory, by an order of several magnitudes, a large enough deviance from the set of data comprising all accidental total and partial collapse modes for tall buildings at all scales to reasonably warrant serious objections to the claims the plane impacts and resulting office fires or maybe an accidental slipshod fuckup were responsible for the utter demise of the Twin Towers - worse even, except for the top-down feature, the energetic signatures correspond best with intentional collapses like the buildings models from Roland Emmerich's
       <em>
        Independence Day
       </em>
       , conventional high-rise controlled demolitions and the occult magic collapse of Barad-Dûr in
       <em>
        Lord Of The Rings
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wish, please write more about how conspiracy theorists misunderstand or misrepresent; about how all buildings are designed that way or how the Twin's design was unique; how they succumbed to the sheer mass from above or how they were so very lightweight, how it was because of planes or fire or momentum and gravity or architectural quirks or plastic buckling or the brittleness of steel; how it is all explained by the experts and how you are not sure what the argument is; how people are mean and condescending towards you or how they patiently reach out for you as a scientist, as a human being, trying to communicate the idea that reason, logic and scientific inquiry

Hint: it underpins not only the paper itself (and further discussions on the paper by the author himself  published through NWU), but Bazant's lifelong research and that is that stuff changes over time. A building is not the same in year Y as year Z with respect to loadbearing capability.

       This is known in civil engineering as creep. Bazant studies this and the relationship of other material elasticities used in construction. He was not only a pioneer in understanding something that was never known about, but also applied that knowledge in understanding the mechanics of the tower collapse.

       So you are saying it decayed from FoS = 2 to FoS = 0.3 (lost more than 75% of its structural integrity) within 30 years

       Steel, concrete, lots of years, then it's normal a tower falls to dust like a house of cards in your sunroom. Or like the

        Torre civica di Pavia
       </a>
       after a thousand years. Or like

       is mentioned only as a function of heat in the impact zone (and in conjunction with the Torre civica di Pavia) in Bazants paper
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the NIST report. There is no word about signs of a new phenomenon like fast-aged steel. It doesn't explain how the rest of the structure lost more than 75% of its strength. Or, if it has, how the towers merely shook a little under the impacts of the planes without crumbling to dust instantaneously. You are making things up now, just like predicted. You deviate from the official story. That makes you officially a conspiracy theorist, or, as some prefer to say, a "truther".

       And, by the way, dear random internet stranger: complain some more about condescending. You are given links to click on, sourced claims, patient explanations, logical arguments - while you make wild allegations, perform some quote-mining acrobatics and tell your fellow human to go find his stuff by himself. Disingenuous or bored troll? A little greedy, aren't we, hmmm?

       Or are you having a problem with the Lord Voldemort in a Deathstar resetting the Matrix explanation? That's okay, replace it to your heart's content. Imagine the terrorists sneaked all the explosives in hidden in gold bullions. Say it was ripped down by its core by the hands of a huge giant living under the earth. Anything. But get that silly stuff out of your system, that the towers collapsed because they were weak from age, you're embarrassing yourself. If there was such a new phenomenon like steel "drying out" over the course of 30 years, a lot of old steel buildings would instantly have been reviewed, updated, double-checked, overhauled or simply emergency evacuated and demolished on the spot and students of architecture been told never ever to build a tower like

       So when i want to think about how strongly i feel about an event, i look to alternate interpretations to see how well founded my beliefs are. Subsequently, all the poor logic, fallacies, outright willful ignorance and false equivalencies quickly remind me that the conclusion i've arrived it is the more accurate one.

       I hold that deep-dish pizza is an abhorrent travesty. I don't support this view by only eating thin-crust pizza. I eat all the deep-dish pizza i can, and thus find out i was correct in my original view.
