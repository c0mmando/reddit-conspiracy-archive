<p>Yes, and that would be an even worse situation than we already have!</p>

<p>The Nayirah testimony was a testimony given before the non-governmental Congressional Human Rights Caucus on October 10, 1990 by a woman who provided only her first name, Nayirah. The testimony was widely publicized, and was cited numerous times by United States senators and the American president in their rationale to back Kuwait in the Gulf War. In 1992, it was revealed that Nayirah&#39;s last name was al-Ṣabaḥ (Arabic: نيره الصباح‎) and that she was the daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, it was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait <strong>public relations campaign which was run by Hill &amp; Knowlton</strong> for the Kuwaiti government. Following this, al-Sabah&#39;s testimony has come to be regarded as a classic example of modern atrocity propaganda. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_%28testimony%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_%28testimony%29</a></p>

<p>A newly declassified document gives a fascinating glimpse into the US military&#39;s plans for &quot;information operations&quot; - from psychological operations, to attacks on hostile computer networks.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most startling aspect of the roadmap is its acknowledgement that information put out as part of the military&#39;s psychological operations, or Psyops, is finding its way onto the computer and television screens of ordinary Americans.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Information intended for foreign audiences, including public diplomacy and Psyops, is increasingly consumed by our domestic audience,&quot; it reads.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Psyops messages will often be replayed by the news media for much larger audiences, including the American public,&quot; it goes on.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the kind of history the people with guns want you to believe. Historically, culture goes to those who make best use of the social and technological medium to secure power. The medium that propagated rule by physical force was outmoded by the early part of the last century. As soon as we had a fast-as-light communication network the battle grounds became ideological rather than physical. Who can best sway the opinion of a reactive human mass became the operative question. Only dinosaurs see history as a series of wars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where innocent until proven guilty comes in. You could hold a court hearing without the defendant, granted his side of the story would not be heard. If the person is found guilty you would have an outstanding debt to collect. You could potentially sell this debt to some kind of collection agency or hire someone to collect it for you.</p>

<p>The right to do this stems from the idea that no force should be used on another person <em>unless</em> that person is guilty of a crime.</p>

<p>Now, it is important to note that if you are finding people guilty of crimes that another court system does not consider a crime, and go around rounding these people up off the street and collecting debts from them, you could be held liable in that other court of aggressive force. </p>

<p>Obviously, you will not be perfect on your prosecutions. Let&#39;s say you are right 10,000 times and 1 time you find an innocent man guilty. You would indeed be liable for the damages you create, but you could potentially minimize the detrimental effect this will have on your business with malpractice insurance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let&#39;s say there are &#39;A&#39;s and &#39;B&#39;s. As think that people can own material things as property. Bs don&#39;t believe in property rights. So a B takes something from an A without A&#39;s consent and with the intent to deprive A of that thing. The As think that the B has committed the crime of theft. What can happen? (The As are a group of people that subscribe to the A court. Bs subscribe to B court.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a prized question to the anarchist. Basically, there would be sort of a market justice.

    <div class="md"><p>Watched the video. Here are my thoughts...</p>

<p>From the dawn of civilization there has always a disproportionate distribution of power among individuals and amount groups of individuals. That is, some individuals are stronger than others and some groups are stronger than others. Those without less power are drawn to those with more power. Groups coalesced around power always self-organize or they disassociate. Organization is always constrained by a system of laws, informal or formal, codified or ad hoc, social, political, economic, etc. This system of laws provides adhesion to the group. Without law, the group cannot function. Like any organism, the fittest groups survive and flourish. What you see today is the evolution of human government. There is always government, there will always be government. What you see today are the fittest governments that have ever existed. </p>

<p>Q: What happens when there is no government? 
A: Government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree. Two things though:</p>

<p>1) The worst case scenario of trying a free market (i.e. dissolving the US gov.) would be a new US gov. being set up.</p>

<p>2) The main difference between a government and a free society is that in a single expanse of territory, multiple law systems can operate. This is radically different than the current system and I believe the competition would do wonders at providing the best products and services at the lowest price.</p>

<p>This includes legal and law enforcement services. With two police departments, at least, in each town, they would have to outdo one another at being courteous, providing security, and having fair laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that governments can&#39;t have secrets then?  That intelligence agencies can&#39;t exist?  Because if you can&#39;t deceive the public, you can&#39;t have secrets.</p>

<p>It would be pretty shitty for our security if for some bizarre reason the U.S. was the only major military power not allowed to have secrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I ever see in this sub is finger-pointing and blaming.</p>

<p>Where are the quality discussions about the conflict of protection and privacy in a digital, globalized world? Or specific policy suggestions to accommodate the changes in technology that US&#39;s constitutional forefathers did not predict?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you work for the gov&#39;t, and your job is to deceive citizens of the United States...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So employees of the intelligence agencies of all the other nations are committing treason? Your title reeks of US-centrism, and recognizing that the U.S. does not act by itself in a vacuum is the first step toward forming a solid set of opinions on the matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>regardless of the circumstances</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re seeking a white/black, definitive line that you can use as a judgmental litmus test. Here&#39;s a little secret -- nothing in the world (sociopolitically speaking, that is) operates this way. The lines are blurry, and that&#39;s <em>the fucking reason every successful governmental has a judicial system.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll admit that my original reply was standoffish and could have been written more tactfully.</p>

<p>That being said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>while adding nothing to the discussion itself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OP didn&#39;t link to any articles to provide fodder for discussion. Notwithstanding, I proceeded to address 2 major concerns in his single-sentence post:</p>

<ul>
<li>US-centric</li>
<li> Dismissal of ambiguity inherent to the topic</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not 100% pro-surveillance. However I think it&#39;s important to note (hence my original comment) that such programs do not operate in a void -- if we shutdown all of our SIGINT programs, it puts the U.S. at a disadvantage b/c all the other nations are not going to do the same -- and that illegal/legal dichotomies rarely exist, hence a judicial system.</p>

<p><a href="/u/IAlwaysDownVoteCats">/u/IAlwaysDownVoteCats</a> - I believe your example (nuremburg) is a false analogy with shaky premises (war crimes tribunal dependent on a world war with genocidal components) and also inaccurate (you&#39;re saying that everyone at Nuremburg was charged with the same crime, to the same extent, across the board?).</p>
