       I'd like to elaborate on what I think is the true power of conspiracy theories, at least for as far as reaching/convincing the masses/mainstream folks goes. I've had this idea for quite a while so I thought it was time to share.
      </p>
      <p>
       When confronted with any theory, for example the NWO agenda, what is at first least interesting to me is the theory itself, i.e. the richest of us wanting control over everyone. The 
true power of a theory for me are the symptoms it addresses. Could you, without postulating a harmful power, see the same symptoms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you write a narrative about the masses being distracted at mass by the mainstream media? I think we can. 
Could you criticize the lack of development of consciousness throughout education in general? I think we can. 
Could you characterize society as an economic rat race, fueled by psychologically advanced advertisement? I think we can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most of us here have had moments of consciousness expansion, where all of a sudden you realize or understand what a theory is trying to convey. A kind of 'woahdude' experience. For me, these moments are usually when realizing the scope of the symptoms, rather than the postulated cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for as far as the mainsteam people go, I think we 'believers' are better off pointing at the symtpoms than defending some wicked theory. It's not about whether or not the theory is true, but people who are not familiar with this stuff can hardly even imagine. The symptoms, however, are usually right in front of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to write some 'convert your neighbour' programme, it's just a thought.

       I like this way of thinking of things, and have had similar thoughts before. Individual conspiracy theories that we believe to be "smoking guns" may not be convincing to someone new, yet most people are aware of at least how the symptoms are directly affecting them in their personal lives. Most are aware of at least a gut feeling that the world is not right, not as it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Focusing on what a person may see wrong, and explaining about how that is part of a much larger pattern of oppression may be a good way to introducing the subject. Once they see how the system is very beneficial to a few, while ultimately detrimental to the rest of us, the actual mechanics of how it is accomplished are less important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether 9/11 was an inside job is in some ways less important than the fact that it was used as justification for the patriot act and two illegal wars. Is it really so much worse if Cheney &amp; Co. orchestrated it rather than just exploiting a crisis whose conditions they helped create? On some level yes, but the consequences are no different.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key fact in the conspiracy theorist mindset is not so much any one or any series of illicit acts, but the sum total effect on us the masses of people. For some, the inconsistent "facts" of major false flags may be enough to convince; for others, a broad consequentialist view of the implications of these individual acts may be productive avenue to investigating truth.

       Exactly, I think we're on the same level. Moreover, I can always go back to this myself to evaluate any theory. For this purpose, the whole Alex Jones is Bill Hicks thing for example, I won't even bother.

       I would argue that it is much worse if Cheney &amp; Co. orchestrated the whole thing simply because it shatters the belief many people buy into that the government is there to protect them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people seem to be able to ignore the little things pointing to a non mothering government, but something as large as an attack on our own by our own would be too much for many to ignore.

       Agreed. Especially on a moral level, the idea of murdering 3000 people in cold blood for political reasons is about as heinous as one can get. To those who can be persuaded that Cheney et al. did it, i would go that route.  I find the evidence convincing for at least willful negligence and foreknowledge of specifics, and likely more involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that for those people who will not look at the evidence or who conclude otherwise, they may be more willing or able to look at the patterns of corruption and abuse of power. Even accepting the official 9/11 narrative as true, the case against Cheney (and I suspect it goes higher) for war crimes including aggression, torture, assassination is just as strong, and demonstrates nearly as much malice.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me the key is finding where a person already has awareness, and helping to increase that awareness. If someone is angry about bank bailouts after 2008, give them information about the LIBOR scandal or IMF/BIS malfeasance. If someone is angry about corporate power relative to people power, bring up TTP and TTIP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Encourage people to go down whatever rabbit hole they're currently contemplating; they all come together if you go deep enough. But more important than focusing on any one event, and basing one's world view on the actuality of one theory, is understanding the larger picture and how it operates, if we are to have any hope of opposing it.

       On the same note, I think one of the most compelling arguments about 9/11 being an inside job actually are Pearl harbor, JFK, gulf of Tonkin, etc..

       Encouragement of their own investigation is often the best that can be done. But even raw  untampered data is more difficult to get online anymore, and I expect it will become worse.

       The whole idea of our society being arranged, designed, intentionally, like a work of architecture (for example... a
       <em>
        pyramid
       </em>
       ), is so alien to most who are not used to thinking in patterns and analogies that it is simply impossible to convey certain meanings and messages simply because we lack a common language. In a way, "our" logic
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       circular. There are symptoms which can only logically be explained by a conspiracy, and since there is a huge, tacid, monolithic conspiracy (as JFK put it), it explains many - if not all - symptoms. It is good for your mental health to sometimes take a step back and try to explain everything as a systemic, organic, fractal, chaotic mess bred from ignorance, stupidity, good will gone wrong, singular failures and typical incompetence and to explain all evidence to the contrary away with innocent synchronicities, accidents and coincidences because, uh, shit happens, and to remind yourself that all in all, people with power also are just humans with very human needs who just wish the best for their kids like everyone and of course they see opportunities and fertilizer where others would just see a f-ton of "happened" shit. Then you notice how stupid that all sounds and put your tinfoil helmet back on before it gets worse.

       I'm not convinced of a singular group at the top, handing out orders to minions which are followed slavishly.  I think a plausible alternative is a number of competing factions with ever-changing alliances, each striving for the same goal of dominance, yet each wanting it for themselves. I could see it working through a sort of gentlemen's agreement: no one going after each other directly or exposing the game to a wider audience. Each playing the game and colluding for mutual benefit where advantageous, while simultaneously trying to outmaneuver each other for the top spots. Think mafia crime families on a bigger stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it seems simplistic that the most ruthlessly competitive people on earth would
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       be competing with each other for the spot of top dog.

       ok, this is not directly related to your post, but it occurred to me while reading your post so here goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We often consider the world to be ruled by "the elite" or tptb or illuminati or whatever. We visualize a bunch of psychopathic madmen bereft of morality and hungry for power to the exclusion of all other concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       the philosophical conundrum of that, for me, is that I find it difficult to see the humanity in that. Others resolve this by imagining the top of the pyramid to be occupied by ETs or demons or satan or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it could also be easily explained by the hypothesis that a group, rather than an individual, rules the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       A group organized by a set of principles based on maintaining and increasing power. Like a corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps even the group that constitutes the highest echelon are beholden to the dictates of an ancient corporation that even they can't forsake for fear of ostracism from their sect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our world might in fact be beholden to something that not a single person on this planet agrees with.

       Well in my most charitable account of the status quo I'd say that the owners of capital are derailed or perverted in their ways. That is to say, they truly believe that making more money is the best thing to do. All the rest is collateral.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too have trouble imagining what is at the top but all we can do is inform ourselves, keep an open mind too everything that comes to us, from others as well as from within and make our own considerations.

       Because this is not in itself a  conspiracy theory but rather a contemplation about conspiracy theories. Therefore it's on the meta level.

      <p>
       Maybe you thought that meta should refer to the operating of the subreddit, but I believe the term is broader in meaning.

       I apologize. I'm pretty new to reddit, so I did not know certain words here mean different things than everywhere else and therefor cannot have the meaning they have everywhere else so a new word must be invented for the meaning the word stands for everywhere else.

       I'm with this guy. I wasn't aware that [meta] on reddit is exclusively used to designate the operating of the subreddit. However, this isn't the only meaning of the word so that's kind of ignorant to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems I misused the tag, I'm sorry. Now I know. Can we now please get back on topic, i.e. the meta analysis of conspiracy theories?

       I'm not convinced of a singular group at the top, handing out orders to minions which are followed slavishly.  I think a plausible alternative is a number of competing factions with ever-changing alliances, each striving for the same goal of dominance, yet each wanting it for themselves. I could see it working through a sort of gentlemen's agreement: no one going after each other directly or exposing the game to a wider audience. Each playing the game and colluding for mutual benefit where advantageous, while simultaneously trying to outmaneuver each other for the top spots. Think mafia crime families on a bigger stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it seems simplistic that the most ruthlessly competitive people on earth would
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       be competing with each other for the spot of top dog.
