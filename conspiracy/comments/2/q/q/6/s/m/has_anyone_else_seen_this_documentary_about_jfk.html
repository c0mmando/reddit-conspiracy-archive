        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just wanted to know peoples thoughts about it as it seemed pretty plausible in my opinion. There was Multiple witnesses that smelled gunpowder after the shooting. If what the Warren Commission says is true than how did people smell gunpowder from a gunshot 5 stories up? Also, you can clearly see a secret service agent holding an AR in one of the films shown of that day. To me an AR seems like a likely candidate because if the first bullet that struck Kennedy was also the same type of round that hit him in the head, wouldn&#39;t the wound have the same effect as when it hit him in the back? E.g. the first bullet when straight through, the fatal shot exploded his head. Seems like different types of rounds were used as well. </p>

<p>Sorry for rant, seems like a factor that really isn&#39;t talked about much.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269NiovMgrs&amp;feature=player_detailpage">Here</a> is the summary of the documentary as I couldn&#39;t find the full length film. </p>

<p>Edit: The theory goes hand in hand with the stand down order given to the agents riding on the rear of JFK&#39;s car. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY02Qkuc_f8&amp;feature=player_detailpage">Here</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched it and it was surprisingly believable. If I remember they gave a pretty solid explanation for the path of the magic bullet too.</p>

<p>My only concern is just imaging that someone could shoot from there without tons of people noticing. It would most likely require everyone in that motorcade who was in the immediate area of the shooter to have been in on it.</p>

<p>I remember also having the feeling that they were saying it was an accidental shot just to make people more willing to accept it. The idea that it was accidental and people covered up for the shooter is plain silly to me.</p>

<p>Surprisingly well presented theory though. When you first hear it you think it sounds ridiculous but after watching you&#39;re not so sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah after watching it, I somewhat believe the &quot;magic bullet&quot; theory now. The seats in the car were not aligned like regular cars. The front seats were lowered a bit. The only problem I had about this film is that I believe it was intentional. Like you said, there is no way it could have been pulled off without everyone being in on it. It goes hand in hand with reports of secret services agents being ordered to back off. Can&#39;t remember where I saw that information but it definitely makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely idiotic.  What the SS agents did was A. Change the route to enter the shooting gallery, and B. Stand down immediately before the shooting.</p>

<p>Also notice tall Johnson already slooped down real low far prior to any shot even being heard.  He knew what was coming because he, along with Bush Sr. were in on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, I saw it and immediately dismissed it as fantasy.</p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s plausible for someone to fire off a rifle round in a crowded car surrounded by 7 secret service agents and 4 Dallas motorcycle cops and not have anyone notice? Dave Powers and Kenny O&#39;Donnel were also in the car and neither of them heard it either. Neither for that matter did a single one of the hundreds of witnesses in Dealey Plaza.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a garbage theory. Oswald shot Kennedy.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s your first problem. Read the Warren Commission, all 26 volumes of it. You&#39;ll find out exactly how deceptive conspiracy writers can be. They&#39;ll ignore 20 pages of expert witness testimony because of one discrepancy somewhere else. They&#39;ll take the shaky word of one witness over 50 others. </p>

<p>As for what I found compelling, it&#39;s a bunch of stuff. Oswalds actions before and after the shooting scream guilt. Computer recreations of the shooting confirm that the single bullet theory is not only viable but the only reasonable explanation for the wounds on both men. Stuff like the fibers at the bottom of the rifle sized paper bag with Oswalds prints found at the depository being a close match to the blanket in Ruth Paine&#39;s garage where he was thought to keep his rifle. Fibers embedded in the butt of the rifle were a close match to the shirt Oswald wore to work that morning, likely lost there when he wiped the rifle down before stashing it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your suggestion was really &quot;read all 26 volumes&quot;? LOL.....</p>

<p>Based on that absurdity, I ignored the next few lines that are anecdoytal....</p>

<p>---Oswalds actions before and after the shooting scream guilt. 
                                     Evidence leads to guilt, not subjective interpretations of behavior.</p>

<p>---Computer recreations of the shooting confirm that the single bullet theory is not only viable but the only reasonable explanation for the wounds on both men.</p>

<p>There are just as many re-creations that point to the impossibility of the single bullet theory.  I point you to the testimony of Cyrl Wecht in 1978</p>

<hr/>

<p>Donald Purdy: Dr. Wecht, what are the major conclusions of the forensic pathology panel with which you are in disagreement?</p>

<p>Cyril Wecht: The major disagreement is the single-bullet theory which I deem to be the very essence of the Warren Commission report&#39;s conclusions and all the other corroborating panels and groups since that time. It is the sine qua non of the Warren Commission report&#39;s conclusions vis-a-vis a sole assassin. Without the single-bullet theory, there cannot be one assassin, whether it is Oswald or anybody else.</p>

<p>I am in disagreement with various other conclusions of the panel. I am most unhappy and have been extremely dismayed by their failure to insist upon the performance of appropriate experiments, which I believe could have been undertaken with a reasonable degree of expenditure of time, energy, and money to once and for all show whether a bullet 6.5-millimeter, copper-jacketed, leadcore piece of military-type ammunition could indeed strike a rib and a radius in a human being and emerge in the condition which Commission exhibit 399 is today.</p>

<p>I am extremely unhappy about the fact that a greater and more intensive effort was not made to locate the missing pieces of very important medical evidence in this case, which I pointed out back in the summer of 1972. Not that I was the first to learn of this, but amazingly, nobody had made that public disclosure prior to that time. I have raised same questions concerning the head wound and the possibility, albeit remote, of a second shot fired in synchronized fashion from the right side or the lower right rear, synchronized with the head shot that struck the President in the back of the head. And this is related to a few pieces, a couple of pieces of evidence and, again, emphasizes the necessity of having the brain to examine. These are the major areas. There are, of course, numerous facets of all of these disagreements that are related to the so-called single-bullet theory.</p>

<p>Donald Purdy: Dr. Wecht, is it your opinion that no bullet could have caused all of the wounds to President Kennedy and Governor Connally or the Commission exhibit 399 could not have caused all of the wounds to both men?</p>

<p>Cyril Wecht: Based upon the findings in this case, it is my opinion that no bullet could have caused all these wounds, not only 399 but no other bullet that we know about or any fragment of any bullet that we know about in this case...</p>

<p>Donald Purdy: Dr. Wecht, what is the basis for your opinion that Commission exhibit 399 could not have caused all of the wounds to President Kennedy and Governor Connally?</p>

<h2>Cyril Wecht: It is a composite based upon several things: The timing of the Zapruder film, which we know runs at 18.3 frames or individual units of the film strip per second; the evaluation of the wounds in the President and Governor Connally; the timing of the test-firing in the hands of the most skilled marksman the Government could find in 1964 of this Mannlicher-Carcano weapon, the bolt action nonautomatic World War II Italian carbine, a grossly inferior weapon; the very vivid testimony of Governor John Connally about which he has been completely consistent for the past 14 years concerning the fact that he was struck by a different bullet; the vertical and horizontal trajectories that must be attributed to Commission exhibit 399 if the single-bullet theory is to be substantiated. These are the various factors that relate to the single-bullet theory.</h2>

<p>But I decided to take a look at the Warren Commission Report, maybe there was something I have missed.  </p>

<p>First off here is a link to the report. <a href="http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/contents/wc/contents_wh.htm">http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/contents/wc/contents_wh.htm</a></p>

<p>I decided to start with Jack Ruby.  Here is the pertentant part---</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Based on its evaluation of the record, however, the Commission believes that the evidence does not establish a significant link between Ruby and organized crime. Both State and Federal officials have indicated that Ruby was not affiliated with organized criminal activity.400 And numerous persons have reported that Ruby was not connected with such activity.401</h2>

<p>Then came the House Select Committe&#39;s findings..</p>

<hr/>

<p>With respect to Jack Ruby, 2 the Warren Commission similarly found no significant associations, either between Ruby and Oswald or between Ruby and others who might have been conspirators with him. (8) In particular, it found no connections between Ruby and organized crime, and it reasoned that absent such associations, there was no conspiracy to kill Oswald or the president. (9) </p>

<p>The committee conducted a three-pronged investigation of conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination. On the basis of extensive scientific analysis and an analysis of the testimony of Dealey Plaza witnesses, the committee found there was a high probability that two gunmen fired at President Kennedy. </p>

<p>Second, the committee explored Oswald&#39;s and Ruby&#39;s contact for any evidence of significant associations. Unlike the Warren Commission, it found certain of these contacts to be of investigative significance. The Commission apparently had looked for evidence of conspiratorial association. Finding none on the face of the associations it investigated, it did not go further. The committee, however, conducted a wider ranging investigation. Notwithstanding the possibility of a benign reason for contact between Oswald or Ruby and one of their associates, the committee examined the very fact of the contact to see if it contained investigative significance. Unlike the Warren Commission, the committee took a close look at the associates to determine whether conspiratorial activity in the assassination could have been possible, given what the committee could learn about the associates, and whether the apparent nature of the contact should, therefore, be examined more closely. 3 </p>

<p>Third, the committee examined groups-- political organizations, national governments and so on--that might have had the motive, opportunity and means to assassinate the President. </p>

<h2>The committee, therefore, directly introduced the hypothesis of conspiracy and investigated it with reference to known facts to determine if it had any bearing on the assassination</h2>

<p>Without brining any other researcher&#39;s into the fold, or the moutians of evidence that are easily attainable, the Warren Commission&#39;s assessment on 
1.  Lone Gunman
2.  Jack Ruby</p>

<p>cannot even pass the scrunity of other Government bodies.</p>

<p>Case closed indeed....</p>

<p>Read the damn investigation and see what the evidence <em>actually was</em> as opposed to what conspiracy authors have twisted it into.</p>

<p>Cyril Wecht disagreed with the Single Bullet Theory in 1978, yes, I&#39;m aware of that.  Computer recreations done <em>since then</em> prove that Wecht had no idea what he was talking about.  Actual physical recreations done <em>in Dealey Plaza</em> with laser sighted weapons prove it too.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Based on dictabelt evidence that was disproven scientifically a year later.  The HSCA also found that Oswald fired 3 shots at Kennedy from the depository and that he was the only one that actually hit anything.  Do you believe that too?</p>

<p>Why am I not surprised to find you quoting the HSCA finding of conspiracy without the slightest idea <em>why</em> they came to that conclusion, or what <em>subsequent</em> investigations actually showed.  Here, I&#39;ll help you out.</p>

<p>Just the first 2 examples that sprung to mind. If I laid out everything that proved Oswalds guilt, it would take me forever. </p>

<p>Here are a few in bullet points. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Oswald went home to visit his wife unannounced on an unusual night, to the same residence he was thought by his wife to keep his rifle. </p></li>
<li><p>He left nearly every dollar he had and his wedding ring before going to work that morning. </p></li>
<li><p>He was witnessed by 2 people bringing a long paper package to work that day, initially ballparked at 3 feet long. When asked what was in the package, he answered curtain rods. No rods were ever found at the depository. When asked by cops what was in the long package, he denied ever bringing it. </p></li>
<li><p>Oswald was unaccounted for during the shooting. </p></li>
<li><p>Eyewitnesses placed a man matching Oswalds description at the 6th floor window of the depository with a rifle. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even bother to read the link I posted yesterday? The HSCA made the second gunman determination based on dictabelt evidence that was proven to be wrong waaaaaay back in 1980.</p>

<p>HB McLain wasn&#39;t in the spot the HSCA said he needed to be for the dictabelt evidence to be valid. He said that from minute one, and photos taken in the Plaza proved it. Sheriff Bill Decker was picked up on the recording during the 4 &quot;shot&quot; sounds saying &quot;hold everything steady&quot;, which he said a minute <em>after</em> the shooting during the flight to Parkland hospital. That definitively proves that the 4 impulses on the dictabelt <em>could not</em> have been shots. </p>

<p>Dude...come on! This stuff has been out there for 34 fucking years! How can you still be quoting the HSCA finding and not have the slightest awareness as to why they came to that conclusion or what follow up investigations showed? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said there was &quot;not a shred of evidence&quot;.  That was one piece.  Here are a few more..</p>

<p>Emmett Hudson, the only man identified out of the three standing on the steps leading up to the fence on the grassy knoll, claimed that all the shots came from the general direction of the TSBD (see Warren Commission Hearings, vol.7, p.560 and p.564).</p>

<p>Buell Wesley Frazier, Billy Lovelady and Otis Williams, three men who were standing on the front steps of the TSBD, directly underneath the supposed sniper’s nest, claimed that all the shots came from the general direction of the knoll.</p>

<p>Charles Brehm, who had an excellent view of the assassination, either changed his mind or was misquoted. He was reported in the Dallas Times Herald on the evening of 22 November as thinking that “the shots came from in front of or beside the President.” The FBI two days later stated that “it seemed quite apparent to him that the shots came from one or two buildings back at the corner of Elm and Houston Streets” (Warren Commission Hearings, vol.22, p.837).</p>

<p>Arnold Rowland thought the shots had come from the knoll, despite already having seen a man in the southwest window of the sixth floor of the TSBD, holding a gun (Warren Commission Hearings, vol.2, pp.171–3).</p>

<p>Um...no it isn&#39;t.  It was scientifically proven that the dictabelt recording did not contain evidence of gunshots.  Therefore it isn&#39;t evidence of anything.</p>

<p>I love that you start quoting auditory evidence (by far the weakest route you could go), and completely ignore the 3 depository employees sitting in the 5th floor window directly underneath the snipers nest that said without question the shooter was firing from directly above them.</p>

<p>How many witnesses heard shots from 2 distinctly different locations?  That&#39;s what you should be looking for.  Here, I&#39;ll spoil the suspense for you...almost none.  Out of the witnesses that picked the depository or the knoll as the source of the shots, almost every single one of them said that location was the <em>only</em> source for the shots.  Since we know <em>for a fact</em> that shots were fired from the depository, anyone that claims shots were fired <em>exclusively from the Knoll</em> is wrong.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll concede that some witnesses picked the Knoll as the source of the shots, but almost no one heard shots from 2 distinct locations.

<p>Medical----</p>

<p>The autopsy face sheet verbally described in the death certificate that there was an entry wound at the president&#39;s third thoracic vertebrae. Conversely, the Warren Commission moved that entry wound from the third thoracic vertebrae 5 to 6 inches up to the base of the neck. This was necessary for the Warren Commission to account for a bullet that exited through the throat and caused further damage in the front seat to Texas Gov. John Connally.</p>

<p>If the death certificate would be given more credibility than the Warren Commission then a peculiar problem faces lone gunman theorists. How does a bullet, when entering the third thoracic vertebrae in a downward trajectory, leave the throat?</p>

<p>This discussion leads us to the throat wound. When JFK was brought to trauma room one in Parkland Hospital, the attending surgeon identified the wound as a wound of entry. Parkland doctors had their fair share of experience with bullet wounds, so their identification should not be questioned. The president was still alive and efforts were being made to save him so a tracheotomy was made. The doctors used the wound of entry and enlarged it so a tube could be inserted.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert N. McClelland, a Parkland surgeon on duty that day, was in trauma room one and was asked to assist with the tracheotomy. As he assisted, he came behind the president, behind his head, and he announced to the other doctors present that there was a wound of exit at the back of his head. McClelland was 18 inches away from the president&#39;s head for a good seven to eight minutes.</p>

<p>Wow, that article is straight out of the 1970s.  It even quotes the dictabelt evidence that was proven false in 1980, just like you did!</p>

<p>Ah, the incestuous circle jerk of conspiracy fandom, never admitting when one is wrong.</p>

<p>So, let me get this straight, the &quot;expert&quot; in the article states that the blood in <em>front</em> of JFKs head is evidence of a shot from the <em>front</em>?  You know how false that is.  A shot from the front would cause an explosive ejection out of the <em>back</em> of the head.  Plus, and here&#39;s a dirty little secret that very few of you JFK conspiracy believers seem to know, the headshot actually caused his head to pitch FORWARD on impact.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/UAFlDvp">http://imgur.com/UAFlDvp</a></p>

<p>Sorry bud, that one image completely disproves the headshot coming from the knoll...unless you can explain how a shot from the front causes the head to pitch <strong>forward</strong> violently 2-3 inches and causes a massive explosion of matter in the same direction as the shot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bullet on the left caused 7 wounds. The bullet on the right caused one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bullet on the left passed all the way through a grown man hitting nothing but muscle, and passed almost all the way through a second man <em>while tumbling</em>, striking the less dense rib bone sideways (accounting for the flattening out at the base) before impacting the wrist.  The bullet on the right was fired at full muzzle velocity through the wrist of a cadaver, striking nothing along the way and losing no velocity.</p>

<p>Surely you can see the difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Medical----
The autopsy face sheet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...is not a forensic drawing and is nowhere near as compelling as PHOTOGRAPHS of the entry wound which are readily available.  5 different medical panels all studied the evidence in depth and found zero evidence of a shot from the front.</p>

<p>Fucking autopsy face sheet...Jesus...</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Multiple doctors at Parkland that attended to JFK are on record as saying there was no way to make a determination of entry and exit for the headwound.  The head was a bloody mangled mess, and not a single one of them actually took the time to inspect the headwound.  Again, 5 medical panels, the autopsy and the autopsy photos all prove the direction the shot came from, which coincides exactly with the Zapruder film showing the head snapping FORWARD on impact.</p>

<p>The shot came from the rear.  If you like, I can post gifs from the Muchmore and Nix films that show the same forward snap and same spray of blood in front.</p>
