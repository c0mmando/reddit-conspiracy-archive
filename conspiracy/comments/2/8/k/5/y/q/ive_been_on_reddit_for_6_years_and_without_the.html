       Just needed to say it and I'm pretty sure my time here will slowly be less and less as I move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey Reddit admin, you guys did a great job totally selling out. You can now pat yourselves on the back and go fuck yourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 1: Just found out about
       <a href="http://whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy">
        http://whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy
       </a>
       ... going to give that a try for a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit 2: I am and will be making the following post to some of the main subs i belong to:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         An alternate site for posting info: whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Now that Reddit is losing its transparency, I will slowly be moving on to another site, i.e, posting all my links to
        <a href="http://whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy">
         whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy
        </a>
        ...and splitting my time between here and there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just figured that it's best to start building the content on the other site now that Reddit has obviously decided to go the way of google, turn to the dark side.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am making this same post to the subReddit that I am most active on just in case others are looking for alternative.
       </p>
       <p>
        As far as disclaimers go, there are none. I am just a user and not affiliated to the other site.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         ps. I'm assuming people can make their own subs as well, I just haven't tried it yet.

       Reddit was a place where stories used to be fresh almost every hour. Now it's seems very locked in place to have the same crap shown all day. One would argue "well that's how news is"... well when reddit was at the top of its game news was every changing and updated regularly.

       I noticed this recently.  Tried to sort by new and it was all crap.  Sort by top?  The same shit all day long.  I used to be able to skim reddit for hours.  Now its more like "well, I might as well finally click this link since there's nothing left to browse".

       Exactly.  I find I can read most of what I want in about 30 minutes and after that I need to wait a day before very much new stuff pops up, but it always seems that there is still a lot of the old stuff in there.

       My best bet is because the user base is growing.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a post hits front page, it's going to stay there longer because more people are constantly logging on throughout the day. So if we had a post without ~500 points, more people are seeing that and then in turn more people are upvoting it, causing it to stay on the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, plus I'm sure there is some rigging going on

       Sucks that I just found reddit. Not too impressed with this sub but I would love to see it years ago.  Is that stuff still available?  How far back can I go?  On mobile now so it's a pain sometimes.

       you might google waybackmachine which archives past history of internet pages. But none of the images will work. There's probably some archived copies of how reddit used to be elsewhere too if you google around a bit. Basically it used to be much more news and tech oriented, with logical and in-depth discussion. Lately it has turned in to basically a 4chan clone

       People used to put much more thought and care in to their comments. This was a hub for discussion about technology and ideas. Now it's just a 4chan meme-fest. You can still find strains of the old reddit in certain subreddits, but you really have to search it out. People just used to be much more thoughtful and respectful. Sure there were memes and funny things, but they were the minority of posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's almost completely dominated by memes and smarmy nonsense.
       <a href="/r/TrueReddit">

       and
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete

       remind me the most of the old reddit, but it's still not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a new site called
       <a href="http://www.whoaverse.com">
        www.whoaverse.com
       </a>
       and it kind of reminds me how reddit used to be, but it doesn't have quite the userbase yet.

       Looks like many are checking whoaverse.com out, and that is good to see.  I think Reddit finally turned itself into DiGG, and the people are walking.  I will split time between the two sites for now and see if there is anything I can offer to help make it grow; but one way or another, Reddit is now dead to me.  This vote total obfuscation is the final straw.

       I will poke the corpse on occasion, but really, I'll be here to take content to a much better place.  Thanks for the heads up on the new site OP.

       the excuse is that they are no longer vote fuzzing.  frontpage posts used to ~60-70% upvotes, now they're at ~90%.
      </p>
      <p>
       so shouldn't the aggregate upvote count be significantly higher now?

       reddit has been fucking trash for at least 2 years now, if not more. Only smaller gaming communities keep me coming here. Normals ruin everything because they knock everything down to the lowest common denominator after infesting it

       You aren't using RES are you? With it before you would see (25|15) up|down votes or whatever the current count was. Now it is displaying (?|?). So if a post is (199|200) it just looks like -1 points, the same as (1|2), instead of being the extremely controversial comment that it is. Does that make sense?

       There are lots of reasons I have seen given as to why it matters to different people.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me in particular, if I make a comment and it has a -1 score that doesn't tell me what kind of traffic it had. Did it only get seen by 1 person who disagreed with it, or did 500 people roll through and have wildly polar opinions about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that easy indicator of the amount of interest and attention that I had before was important to me. I don't collect karma, but I usually want to be at least somewhat useful in the conversation. This was a key metric for determining how useful I am on reddit.

       Not for comments, which is where the main issue is.  And even for posts, all you get is the net total - you used to be able to see the actual number of upvotes and the actual number of downvotes.

       Exactly, they want us off of the front page of the internet, they are trying to purge us from Reddit and seems like the internet entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are attacking us as hard as they can, and we must not allow ourselves to become divided.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, we should be drafting a new Reddit Constitution and an anti-corruption task force subreddit which has one permanent thread explaining all the ways in which the voting could be exploited, and the good measures enacted to minimize that, which this new masked up/down garbage is most certainly not.

      <p>
       As an example, this post has 23 points and 82% like it. Meaning 28 people have upvoted at 5 people have down voted (23/.82 = 28, 28-5 = 23 points)

       And why do I have to do that calculation manually? And why would they remove a feature that everyone loved? Why less transparency?

      <p>
       By the way, I teach math, so for me, the more data we have the better we understand how things work. We should not have to work around a system, i.e., the system should work for us not against us.

       No, that is not true. The counts were flubbed, as far as a 200 liking, 199 not liking, could show as 1/0 or even 0/-1. This only really effects new posts because once you hit 10000 upvotes or a really big amount it doesnt have an as big effect. The numbers are real, its just the way they were presented.

       I've read about this new vote-thingie.. but I just thought it was another conspiracy theory.

       Could someone explain to me EXACTLY what has changed? Feels a bit lost atm as I almost never care about up/down votes and mostly keep to "new" page.

       It was one of the best features of Reddit. It allowed you to know how much interest was in a post and and the distribution was. For some of us math people, it was the best feature.

       I think another good example is where you have the main post voted 3/2, and then a reply with a vote of 11/10. Now both posts will have a score of 1, whereas before the effort to suppress the comment was there for all to see.

       You can no longer see how many people up voted and down voted posts. Without seeing that, you don't know how many people down voted it or if a bunch of puppet accounts up voted the post in order to stabilize the count and give the post a higher spot on the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: without the actual numbers, the percentages can be fixed in order to keep certain content in certain places.

       Not sure why you are being downvoted just because these other people don't understand. If you are using a mobile app, some are still showing all the upvotes/downvotes. I use Baconreader for android and all the post say 0 downvoted but show the sum as the upvotes.

       I think this change could be related to reducing server traffic load. When I submit an important post I will sometimes check it multiple times by reloading the page. Now that I can't see vote counts, just the totals, I'm less tempted to keep refreshing the page.

       I don't see how. You still see the points. This one currently has 164 upvotes above however many down votes. So what's the difference? What does it matter to see the actual number of up and down votes? All that matters is if you have positive or negative votes.

       So you can't see that this post has 277 points? That is 277 upvotes. It is seriously no different other than you can't see something like 645 upvotes and 368 down votes. You still see your upvotes which is the points.

       Why?, you need validation that your point means something instead of having confidence that your opinion is valued ?
