    <div class="md"><p>reddit is good but it&#39;s got a lot of problems, personally i think that the structure is somewhat flawed in that there is the community, the mods and the admin which creates almost a caste system in the subs.  </p>

<p>I mean i understand the reasons but i think there are other solutions to them, i mod over fifty subs many well known metasubs and often modmail is a different world to the actual sub, everyone&#39;s friends and sticks up for each other which biases the choices made.  </p>

<p>Taking away information on how many people have liked or disliked something is annoying because it means the many downvote mobs that lurk can totally silence the people they&#39;re trying to silence - i mean i consider myself a good member of the community, i&#39;ve spent a lot of time here and been golded a fwe times, i comment because i like to hear replies, get opinions and speak my mind but if most my comments seemed to be going into dead air then i&#39;d probably find somewhere better to chat, i don&#39;t mind downvote and i&#39;m not that impressed by upvotes but if it looks like my comments have only been seen by one person because it&#39;s +10 -11 then it&#39;s going to feel a lot less like i&#39;m part of a conversation.  </p>

<p>I mean what is this about? did they even give a reason beside &#39;bluhblhblug security of the site, blurblur spammer blurblur freedom.&#39; the age old reason which isn&#39;t a reason.  If they know people are manipulating the site when why not show us some numbers and tell us who&#39;s doing it? i mean not only might that cause blowback and convince them not to do it but we&#39;d be aware and could mentally ignore the effects.</p>

<p>makes me wonder if this isn&#39;t actually to make vote brigading and opinion shaping easier? </p>

<p>Fast forward a few years and its taken off to the grand scale it is today.</p>

<p>Why are you surprised it is what it is today? We don&#39;t technically pay for it, so we really don&#39;t have MUCH reason to complain, let alone a platform to challenge the direction its headed. </p>

<p>Now, I agree with you, don&#39;t get me wrong. I just don&#39;t think fighting reddit is a worthwhile cause. I think that we should adapt instead and keep up the <em>real</em> fight. </p>
