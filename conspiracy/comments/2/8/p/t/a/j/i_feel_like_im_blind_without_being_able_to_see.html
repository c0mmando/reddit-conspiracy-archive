       That information really makes the difference sometimes when deciding whether or not I will chime in to a conversation. It also removes a great deal of my enjoyment in reading comments and commenting because I can't tell if something I or anyone else said was controversial (or to what degree). I feel less of a desire to comment, and to be honest, I feel less of a desire to even visit Reddit because they just pulled a Facebook. When the hell are we going to have a social network of the people, for the people, and by the people? I thought Reddit was it...

       reddit is good but it's got a lot of problems, personally i think that the structure is somewhat flawed in that there is the community, the mods and the admin which creates almost a caste system in the subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean i understand the reasons but i think there are other solutions to them, i mod over fifty subs many well known metasubs and often modmail is a different world to the actual sub, everyone's friends and sticks up for each other which biases the choices made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking away information on how many people have liked or disliked something is annoying because it means the many downvote mobs that lurk can totally silence the people they're trying to silence - i mean i consider myself a good member of the community, i've spent a lot of time here and been golded a fwe times, i comment because i like to hear replies, get opinions and speak my mind but if most my comments seemed to be going into dead air then i'd probably find somewhere better to chat, i don't mind downvote and i'm not that impressed by upvotes but if it looks like my comments have only been seen by one person because it's +10 -11 then it's going to feel a lot less like i'm part of a conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean what is this about? did they even give a reason beside 'bluhblhblug security of the site, blurblur spammer blurblur freedom.' the age old reason which isn't a reason.  If they know people are manipulating the site when why not show us some numbers and tell us who's doing it? i mean not only might that cause blowback and convince them not to do it but we'd be aware and could mentally ignore the effects.
      </p>

       makes me wonder if this isn't actually to make vote brigading and opinion shaping easier?

       The official reason amounted to little more than, "too many people say, 'who would downvote this?'"
      </p>
      <p>
       This also makes manipulating votes in the new queue far easier, as well as burying (or upvoting to the top) individual comments.

       This entire website was built from shell (not shill) and fake accounts to seed posts and comments in order to lure more people to repeat that same process.

      <p>
       Fast forward a few years and its taken off to the grand scale it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you surprised it is what it is today? We don't technically pay for it, so we really don't have MUCH reason to complain, let alone a platform to challenge the direction its headed.

      <p>
       Now, I agree with you, don't get me wrong. I just don't think fighting reddit is a worthwhile cause. I think that we should adapt instead and keep up the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       fight.

       The users make Reddit what it is. Many of us also donate to keep it alive. We absolutely should have a say in its direction.

       Why? Donations aren't mandatory. Your participation is not needed. The 'organic' portion of reddit is far gone and proven to be so.
      </p>
      <p>
       What recourse do you have? Did you agree (does anyone agree?) to a End Users License Agreement or some sort of Terms of Use? I mean, beyond the stupid and marginally followed 'reddiquette?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I really am not trying to argue against trying, just highlighting the futility of it. It's like petitioning Facebook to stop being so shitty.

       Unfortunately people have taken it upon themselves to flood this place with scripts and proxy posters. One must remember the tubes are built on trust, there is only so far any system administration can go before by nature it becomes overreaching.

       I think that is odd, to allow your experience to be colored by others opinions and that is what the up/down is about, opinions.

       I respect other people's opinions and enjoy hearing them. Many people come hear just to socialize and hear other opinions about issues that matter to them. Once a certain level of trust or understanding within a subreddit is established, users definitely benefit from being able to see how many people upvoted AND downvoted each submission. Controversiality, and the degree to which something (especially individual comments) is controversial, within a subreddit community you frequent often is important. That is exactly what has been taken away.
