<p>ISIS is slowly going from a terrorist organization to a terrorist state, that is if their current trend stays true.</p>

<p>Now knowing how 9/11 was a false flag operation that caused the United States government the ability to invade Iraq via Afghanistan &quot;legally&quot;, what if ISIS is actually US funded to an extent, or informed by the US on where to attack? </p>

<p>This would thereby allow the United States to re-invade the Middle East in their grand scheme to control it.</p>

<p>Started during Bush Sr., re-tried during Bush Jr. (but then that&#39;s when the entire government changed wasn&#39;t it?), and now being re-tried again with Obama. Well Obama will get the blame, but he&#39;s just the mouth piece.</p>

<p>edit: The MSM seems to be putting the idea into the public&#39;s mind that another 9/11 like event is going to happen. If it does, then yes it will be used as a pretext for war most likely against Iran. We just cannot let emotions get the best of us when we are attacked. </p>

<p>Yeah, but then that truck needs to get to ocean or air somehow to transport from NK to USA.  Can&#39;t drive from one to the another brainiac.  NK would sell the terrorists meth, but would never give up a prized possession like a nuke, I don&#39;t care how much money a terrorist organization has.  People gotta realize, money ain&#39;t worth the denim it&#39;s printed on.  Wealth, power: they come from physical, tangible items that have intrinsic value themselves, not because of the ability of later exchange.  If the terrorists wanted to trade a vial of Ebola for a nuke that would be much more plausible </p>

<p>ISIS is what happens when an ultra powerful nation steamrolls a weaker one, removes a leader who had control of the situation from power, and attempts to hand people democracy (which has never in the history of humanity been successful).</p>

<p>Bush Sr. actually knew better. He made motions toward removing Hussein from power way back then, but he listened to his intelligence who told him it would only worsen the situation - lead to exactly this. And he stopped short of that objective.</p>

<p>Bush Jr. wanted to one-up his daddy and &quot;God told him to do it&quot; and look at the mess they&#39;ve got in Iraq now. He&#39;s quite possibly the worst President in history. Yes, worse even than that fucktard Carter.</p>

<p>That&#39;s naive. Yes, Dubya was a dunce, but he wasn&#39;t in charge of what was going on in that office. The same people who were in charge when his Daddy was in office were pulling the strings while he was.</p>

<p>Daddy Bush didn&#39;t take out Saddam because he was our bitch.  He was willing to stay on the petrodollar. </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t heard yet, ALL wars are banker wars. Every. Single. One.</p>

<p>According to page 28 of William R. Clark’s book Petrodollar Warfare: Oil, Iraq and the Future of the Dollar:
“On September 24, 2000, Saddam Hussein allegedly “emerged from a meeting of his government and proclaimed that Iraq would soon transition its oil export transactions to the euro currency.”</p>

<p>Not long after this meeting, Saddam Hussein began preparing to make the switch from pricing his country’s oil exports in greenbacks to euros. As renegade and newsworthy this action was on the part of Iraq, it was sparsely reported in the corporate-controlled media.</p>

<p>Clark comments on the limited media coverage on page 31 of his book:
“CNN ran a very short article on its website on October 30, 2000, but after this one-day news cycle, the issue of Iraq’s switch to a petroeuro essentially disappeared from all five of the corporate-owned media outlets.”</p>

<p>By 2002, Saddam had fully converted to a petroeuro – in essence, dumping the dollar.</p>

<p>On March 19, 2003, George W. Bush announced the commencement of a full scale invasion of Iraq.</p>
