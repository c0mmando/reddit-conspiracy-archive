<p>Finally, the veil begins to drop.  A little girl who was reported to have been asked to leave a KFC because her appearance was disturbing customers was never actually in the KFC.  </p>

<p>How many of the stories you see on TV are nothing but hoaxes like this?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously the little girl has suffered, so hopefully with the money and Dr. she can be fixed up and live a normal life. And with any luck, this farce will allow the girl to end up with some people around her that actually care for her. 
I say the conspiracy here is KFC. What did they know and when did they know it? Maybe it is good marketing or maybe they set this family up. I am sure the lawyer will get the blame pretty soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its pretty simple, oh frustrated one.</p>

<p>the lady faked her childs harassment by KFC.
 media picks up scent that a major food chain harassed a partially blind girl, as usual, they dont back-check the story.
they release the case as &#39;news&#39;, its not until the story is aired that KFC is asked for a comment, they dont, until they investigate.
KFC finds have no wrong-doing on their part, but other media outlets have picked up &amp; spread the story, also not back-checking to see if it is in fact, accurate.</p>

<p>This is nothing new, what rock have you been under.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Is that what i am doing? why would i do that? do you know me? Fox news is hardly a reputable news source, but in this case, i dont think it was a conspiracy that was planned here, i think it was a case of &quot;i want to be the first to break this case so im not going to fact-check it and just run it&quot;
dont insult me by saying im trying to obfuscate, you have no grounds and no reason to say that. none at all. you just dont have anything better to rebutt it with, so you dont really say anything at all except using a term you heard on the Alex Jones Show.</p>
