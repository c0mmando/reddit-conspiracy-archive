       Finally, the veil begins to drop.  A little girl who was reported to have been asked to leave a KFC because her appearance was disturbing customers was never actually in the KFC.

       How many of the stories you see on TV are nothing but hoaxes like this?

       I was saying it all last week. People love to get angry. I am sure most of them will never hear about this and just move on to the next terrible tragedy they can be upset over.

       I am guessing KFC know this before they gave the money. Now they can let her keep it and look like fucking gold.

       Obviously the little girl has suffered, so hopefully with the money and Dr. she can be fixed up and live a normal life. And with any luck, this farce will allow the girl to end up with some people around her that actually care for her. 
I say the conspiracy here is KFC. What did they know and when did they know it? Maybe it is good marketing or maybe they set this family up. I am sure the lawyer will get the blame pretty soon.

       According to the report KFC discovered the truth while investigating the story internally.  They checked their in store cameras and found the girl was never inside the location claimed to be the offender.

       The first I heard of this type of event is from Ed Chiarini at wellaware1.com, who also reveals all the crisis actors used for these "stories".  His research is not 100% correct (how could it be), but a good deal of it is eye opening and downright shocking.  I promise you that if you look at his research with an open mind you will never look at the world the same again.

       I disagree. The little girl does need a lot of expensive plastic surgery. The Las Vegas doctor who donated his services for the surgery is doing a good thing that has nothing to do with the little girl's horrible family.

       This the typical MO in all of these hoax stories, which Ed often points out.  It is one of the more useful methods for paying their actors.  Look at how much Jeff Bauman (sp?) made off the Boston Firecracker.

       Nope, but it is straight out of the conspiracy playbook.  How many news stories are actually just elaborate hoaxes meant to provoke a certain response? Far more than most people would guess, is the answer.

       Kind of reminds me of the story where the Red Lobster waitress claimed a customer gave her no tip and wrote "None, Ni**er" in the tip section of his credit card receipt. She got all sorts of sympathy and (I think) even some money out of it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The customer lashed out saying he had not written it, and handwriting analysis proved he didn't write it.

       the lady faked her childs harassment by KFC.
 media picks up scent that a major food chain harassed a partially blind girl, as usual, they dont back-check the story.
they release the case as 'news', its not until the story is aired that KFC is asked for a comment, they dont, until they investigate.
KFC finds have no wrong-doing on their part, but other media outlets have picked up &amp; spread the story, also not back-checking to see if it is in fact, accurate.

       Is that what i am doing? why would i do that? do you know me? Fox news is hardly a reputable news source, but in this case, i dont think it was a conspiracy that was planned here, i think it was a case of "i want to be the first to break this case so im not going to fact-check it and just run it"
dont insult me by saying im trying to obfuscate, you have no grounds and no reason to say that. none at all. you just dont have anything better to rebutt it with, so you dont really say anything at all except using a term you heard on the Alex Jones Show.

       You accused me of watching Alex Jones, outing yourself as someone who does not spend much time in this sub searching for the truth.  I wrote what I did because it is the answer anyone mentioning Jones would get from me.  Anyone who has spent any decent amount of time in this sub would know this.

       Yep. I really outted myself. Keep wasting your time with tabloids buddy. Or keep "studying" this shit. Whatever makes you happy. Your obfuscating yourself from looking into proper conspiracies, but then again, we don't need name-calling people labellers that have no argument or rebuttal. What a waste of time you are. And you have the gall to accuse me stupid shit like that. Well done. Your a frickin plebian.
