The GOP did that!&quot; Any time you see words like this in a post they are trying to bait you into an argument:</p>

<ul>
<li>Democrat / Republican</li>
<li>liberals / conservatives</li>
<li>left wing / right wing</li>
<li>libtards / wingnuts</li>
<li>Bush / Cheney / Obama / Biden / Holder / Clinton / etc.</li>
<li>red / blue</li>
<li>GOP / Libs / Dems / Repubs / progressives / neocons </li>
<li>Left / Right</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Don&#39;t fall for it! It&#39;s a giant puppet show designed to distract everyone from real issues. If you see a political title or wording in a post, downvote it and move on.</strong> </p>

<p>The Democrats are functionally no different from the Republicans and vice versa. They are <strong>both</strong> working from the same play book and following orders from the same people. The two sides say different things to get people to fight with each other over meaningless differences. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, nobody questions the multi-trilllion dollar military-industrial-congressional complex or the CIA and NSA who operate on &quot;black budgets&quot; which are completely off the record. </p>

<p>Stop fighting about Democrats vs. Republicans. It&#39;s a waste of time. This is not <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>! This is being done on purpose to distract people. Focus on the actual conspiracies and forget about the left vs. right blame game. Try to figure out who&#39;s CONTROLLING the game.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question: &quot;<strong>What is the budget for the CIA and what do they do with the money?</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Here are some cartoons which may help explain the situation:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True on all accounts, especially the critical thinking. If we ever got the idea that we had the power to make them quake in their boots, that would definitely be a plus, and might change things for the better. Which of course is bad for them. Instead, we know more about what celebrities did, what scandal is threatening to upend the world this week, or are reminded to be afraid of any number of imminent perils (comets hurtling towards Earth! Viruses! Scary terrorists! Shootings! MASS Shootings! etc).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason this tactic has been so successful is because human beings have a natural psychological duality seemingly built in as a species. This shows itself in a variety of ways, but one such illustration is that most people lean either progressive, or conservative. To varying degrees, it&#39;s probably split somewhat down the middle. Similar to the gender split. TPTB know this component to our nature and cynically use it against us. They use this trick to create a dog-whistle effect, which attampts to split us down the middle, so we waste time and energy squabbling about relatively minor social crap...meanwhile, the important business of the day gets done in the backrooms with the lobbyists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely a division point and people are being abused. But, is it really a conspiracy? A lot of those stories probably belong in places like <a href="/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut">/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut</a> or <a href="/r/AmIFreeToGo">/r/AmIFreeToGo</a></p>

<p>If there are actual conspiracies (e.g. - launching drones over a city and trying to hide it) then I would say post it. But, not every news story about the police is a conspiracy. The organization that is behind the building of the police state.... now THAT&#39;S conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They won&#39;t win until mainstream media allows them into the discussion, and allowed in the debates. How are people supposed to know the Green Party is there, if MSM doesn&#39;t report on it? </p>

<p>When they start to actually do this, there really isn&#39;t too much of a chance. I&#39;m of the mindset that if the Greens get that 7% (or how much they need) to be &quot;officially recognized,&quot; then the tables will turn. </p>

<p>Also, I believe, the only way to infiltrate the system w/ the Greens (or any other 3rd party) is to start state to state. If we can get alternatives in state offices, then we can start to make change. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a slow process. But I&#39;m in it for the long run. It makes me hopeful to hear about Seattle voting for a Socialist to their city council. This is how it starts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an act. It&#39;s all designed to divide the population and keep people fighting with each other. They pick issues that polarize people and then exaggerate. If you watch TV, they even tell you what to think about it. When people fight each other they just parrot back catchphrases, soundbites, and buzzwords. Most people don&#39;t even understand the problems they are fighting about. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question: &quot;<strong>What is the budget for the CIA and what do they do with the money?</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The answer is: nobody knows. Nobody has known for 50+ years. Because we&#39;re too busy fighting about immigration, minorities, marijuana, gay marriage, and abortion. We need to focus on the bigger picture first. With the amount of money the CIA is spending covertly plus the money that goes to the military industrial complex, you could solve every problem on the planet 10 times over. </p>

<p>The reason nobody asks these questions is that we&#39;re busy getting hung up on superficial &quot;problems&quot; that divide us into two camps. We&#39;re so busy trying to &quot;win&quot; and beat the other side and stick it to them, that we never focus on the <strong>real</strong> problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to be fair, if you&#39;re not allowed to marry or adopt due to your sexual orientation, that&#39;s a &quot;real problem&quot;. And dismissing issues such as this as &quot;fake&quot; just feeds into the libertarians-as-bigots narrative that drives liberals back to the state.</p>

<p>Now I do agree that the differences are a facade, designed to give us an illusion of choice, but it&#39;s a bit more complicated if you&#39;re not a white male.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, this is the problem. </p>

<p>Gay&#39;s rights to marry is all but a distraction. All it does is keep the sides fighting amongst each other. Gays and liberals fighting with Republicans and religious people. The issue is important, but if you look at the bigger picture of, Well the US/World could be on the brink of a revolution, it seems pretty small in comparison. If we do not have a US to call home, that is a nation of laws which is by the people, for the people. Then, you&#39;re left with what? The ability to marry in a fascist land? Last time I checked, many fascists were against gays. So the answer is to unite with each other. Put the smaller issues aside for now and stand together in the fight to take back the country from crony, corrupt, self serving politicians. We need to rein back the Intelligence community, rein back the military. There are so many bigger issues at hand. </p>

<p>Once that is accomplished we can look at issues such as a &quot;Marriage License&quot;. Frankly I do not care if gays want to be together, call it a union, reform the tax codes (if possible get rid of them), let the religious people have the word &quot;marriage&quot;, tis only a word after these changes take place. That&#39;s a compromise, that&#39;s how governments should be running things. True compromise, not phony kabuki theater. </p>

It gives the Dems too much cover. If he would have changed the rules, it would have meant that the Dems would have had to pass some laws aimed at helping the plebs, at the expense of their masters. Instead now they get to keep blaming that darn GOP for filibustering all their bills.</p>

<p>Meanwhile behind the scenes, the elites that control both parties are pleased that the GOP filibustered, while at the same time, making it seem as if one party cared about the plebs. When in fact they are both doing their bidding to the elites. Both are rotten to the core. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an act. It&#39;s all designed to divide the population and keep people fighting with each other. They pick issues that polarize people and then exaggerate. If you watch TV, they even tell you what to think about it. When people fight each other they just parrot back catchphrases, soundbites, and buzzwords. Most people don&#39;t even understand the problems they are fighting about. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question: &quot;<strong>What is the budget for the CIA and what do they do with the money?</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The answer is: nobody knows. Nobody has known for 50+ years. Because we&#39;re too busy fighting about immigration, minorities, marijuana, gay marriage, and abortion. We need to focus on the bigger picture first. With the amount of money the CIA is spending covertly plus the money that goes to the military industrial complex, you could solve every problem on the planet 10 times over. </p>

<p>The reason nobody asks these questions is that we&#39;re busy getting hung up on superficial &quot;problems&quot; that divide us into two camps. We&#39;re so busy trying to &quot;win&quot; and beat the other side and stick it to them, that we never focus on the <strong>real</strong> problem. </p>
