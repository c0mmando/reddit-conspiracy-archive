<p>Whatever your opinion of the events that unfolded in Sandy Hook that day. </p>

<p>Two things are abundantly clear:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There were definite discrepancies, oddities, misreports and a concerned effort to keep a lid on it. <em>Whatever the reason. These are facts.</em></p></li>
<li><p>There is a furious contingent that wishes to vilify anyone who dares to question the events of the day as if they are the murderers of innocent children.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s just insanity. If we can&#39;t talk about these things in an open forum. The next question is why can&#39;t we talk about them?</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Despite the intended civility of this post it has still devolved into name-calling, x-posting, and misinformation from both sides.</p>

<p>To deny the odd nature of this event is just willful ignorance, to make grand allusions to the occult is equally unhelpful. </p>

<p>I really used to enjoy this place but I think it might be time to pursue more productive conversations elsewhere. </p>

<p>Thanks to Monkeyhear for the most interesting response.</p>

<p><em>Edit 2:</em> In their usual fashion users from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> brigade posts with any Sandy Hook related discussion. Color me surprised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question to this day is, if this was staged why WEREN&#39;T the tracks covered better?  If they have the knowledge, ability and power to stage an event of this magnitude then don&#39;t you think they would be smart enough to do so?  Or could it possibly be that they know no one will say shit so why bother being that thorough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t cover all the tracks with something that big.  They count on the ability to fool the public with television-like &quot;reality&quot;.  And it works.  Most Americans can not see the difference between reality as it&#39;s presented to them on TV vs. reality itself.  They convince the majority and label the rest as conspiracy theorists.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s difficult to speculate but there are many reasons why &quot;they&quot; <em>may</em> have done this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To mock those of us paying attention.</p></li>
<li><p>To create division amongst those of us who question SH and those who don&#39;t and consider us &quot;insensitive&quot; for questioning a &quot;national tragedy&quot; such as SH</p></li>
<li><p>To see just how gullible people are and how much faith they place in the MSM - if they&#39;ll believe the reporting on such a poorly staged event, they&#39;ll believe the reporting on <em>any</em> event</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to get into the possible occult/ritual aspects of SH, it could&#39;ve been a way to create reality from strictly artificial means - to the people who believe the official story, this event actually happened,  kids actually died, etc.  A false reality has been created (if the event was indeed staged)</p></li>

<p>I could probably think of a few more (you probably can too) but these were the first that came to mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed with these and (the event was indeed staged). </p>

<p>The domestic propaganda ban was abandoned in 2013 because too many involved in Sandy Hook were afraid of being exposed to a court of law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if that&#39;s what is bothering you, I can easily debunk it. The site you&#39;re referring to was a facebook page devoted to Victoria Soto&#39;s remembrance—called R.I.P Vicki Soto—and yes, it was made a few days before her death. Seems odd right? Well the creator said it wasn&#39;t created as Soto&#39;s memorial page, it was created as something else entirely irrelevant to Sandy Hook. After she died, he simply changed the name of the page, which also changed the URL, and changed the text that says &quot;____ joined Facebook on December 10&quot;. That&#39;s the way Facebook works. No conspiracy here.</p>

<p>He is not related to Soto, he is just a random guy who created the page. Here is his exact quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay everyone, this is the final time I will tell you why this page was created November 14th. This used to be a &#39;unpublished&#39; personal page for myself. Unpublished means it is not a public page and no one sees it. I was gonna use it, but never did. So when the time of the shooting came, I decided to create a better use for the page, and not remake a whole other one. Therefore being that if a page is unpublished, no one can see it except for yourself. So I could rename the page since it had 0 likes. I am no fraud, I did not predict something like this could happen, I am not linked to the shooting. Don&#39;t believe me? Fine with me, you can leave the page. So don&#39;t bother to ask. Thank you, and bye.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did he change the name? My theory is that he was an attention whore trying to ride on the wave of a tragedy to get a popular facebook page. He posts pictures like &quot;1 like = 1 prayer. 1 share = 1,000 prayers. Keep scrolling if you don&#39;t care.&quot; I&#39;m not making that up, that&#39;s an exact quote.</p>

<p>It&#39;s typical shitty facebook page fare. He probably decided to change the name of an already existing facebook page instead of creating a new one because he wanted to make it as quick as possible and be &quot;the first&quot; page out there in hopes of being the most popular. In a way, he succeeded.</p>

<p>Do you still have questions about that? I would be happy to attempt to explain any other thing you&#39;re still confused by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, smpjs, there were quite a few websites -- including, bizarrely enough, ones that are owned by news and media organizations -- that posted &quot;coverage&quot; of (and specific details about) the Sandy Hook shooting several days before the event even occurred. I believe that TaSteTeA may have possibly been referring to those sites, instead, as there has been quite a bit of talk about those sites on some forums and video channels, lately.</p>

<p>To clarify: I&#39;m not stating that I, personally, know exactly what transpired, or that I have any concrete opinions on the matter or such. However, I just wanted to let you know that evidence exists that appears to show that multiple sites (other than Facebook) did, indeed, post articles about the shooting before it took place.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid that I don&#39;t have the links to the most intriguing videos on the subject available, right now, but the following video partially covers the topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKLClNlsNCs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKLClNlsNCs</a></p>

<p>Also, some of the GoFundMe pages (that were specifically devoted to raising money for the families of the victims in Sandy Hook) were also created a day or two before the actual shooting, as well. </p>

<p>I realize that I haven&#39;t given you many specific details to work with, but if you could explain how pertinent news articles were created and posted, online, before the date that the shooting happened, and how GoFundMe pages were verifiably created (photos, descriptions and all) and posted on December 13th, rather than the 14th, then I would genuinely like to hear your explanation.

<p>I&#39;m sure the guy will get his due punishment from the state and if the parents are at all professional and mature they will have shrugged it off almost instantaneously.  I&#39;m pretty sure the prosecutors and the parents don&#39;t need their very own reddit white knights to demonize all questioning parties, but nonetheless there they are, full of anger and vitriol.</p>

Your attempt to compare this to climate change denial (FYI that&#39;s what researchers are calling it now since, you know, global warming is inaccurate.) is completely unfounded.

    <div class="md"><p>I have never heard a proper official explanation for the incredible breaches in emergency medical response protocols ie. triage and medevac. </p>

<p>What I&#39;ve been lead to believe is that law enforcement declared everyone dead at the scene (which is both a major breach of procedure and highly unlikely.) </p>

<p>Adding to the abnormality is the muster station (at a fire station down the road from the school) where parents of allegedly murdered children are calmly walking in circles.</p>

<p>Say what you will about coping mechanisms. I, and every single parent I know would be clawing at the gates to get our children away from there. It would be a powerful and emotional scene, not the one we were shown. </p>

<p>These two things, coupled with a very closed door investigation IMO do not add up. </p>

A minute or two later in the same recording, they followed this up by saying that one of them may be wearing a nun outfit and reconfirmed that they&#39;re driving a purple van. None of this was ever explained or elaborated on afterwards to my knowledge - it&#39;s one of those things that just sort of &quot;disappeared down the memory hole&quot;, so to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not, a large group of people actually did submit a petition to the White House on this very subject; they wanted to make it illegal for a person or group to publicly post (via the Internet) that Sandy Hook was a hoax.</p>

<p>The full text of the petition has since been removed from WhiteHouse.gov, but it was originally located at this link:</p>

<p><a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/ban-sandy-hook-hoax-websites-channels-and-videos/WkKmcGnG">https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/ban-sandy-hook-hoax-websites-channels-and-videos/WkKmcGnG</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read posts by numerous people (including notable Hollywood figures), on Twitter, that echoed this exact same sentiment. </p>

<p>So, could a person really be &quot;fucking serious&quot;, as you stated, about this issue? Based on the petition and all of the related statements that I&#39;ve read, I&#39;d have to say yes -- and that fears of such insane and irrational measures are by no means &quot;unfounded&quot;.</p>

<p>I agree with you that the idea of such restrictions in this country is an absolutely crazy one, to put it mildly, but please understand that there ARE groups that are trying very hard to put an end to any discussion on the matter. In truth, it is not really &quot;crazy&quot; for anyone to say that such a thing could happen, when, as you can see, there are people that actually are trying to make the simple act of discussion illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies as I have never been privy on hearing any conspiracy theories regarding SH. Can someone please explain what said conspiracy theory/theories entail (what they are, who committed then, what they stood to gain, etc.). I&#39;m all for suspending my disbelief and hearing the other end of an argument but all I&#39;ve seen from this thread is conflicting &quot;facts&quot; with no supporting links and hearsay (I heard/ read somewhere that someone said ...). It&#39;s brought me no closer to figuring out whether there&#39;s any basis behind a conspiracy let alone what it would be...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American media stations, in their desperate race to have the next &quot;breaking news&quot;, or to have the first coverage of something constantly misreports things.  In an event like Sandy Hook, which was very chaotic, but also television ratings gold, news stations reports tons information that they don&#39;t fact check at all. Conspiracy theorists latch on to the misreported information, come up with excuses for real information and a conspiracy theory is born. You&#39;d have to be a complete tool to believe that this was a &quot;false flag&quot;  That word is being throw around so much nowadays that some dude could get into a fight in a McDonald&#39;s and it&#39;s a false flag operation to distract from the fact that the government is trying to take our civil liberties from us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My biggest issue with all of your conspiracy theories on Sandy Hook is the fact that you feel they(the government) needed to come up with this crazy, complex, and interconnected network of people, buildings, and organizations, to push their agenda down the people&#39;s throats. I mean why would they even risk so many unknown variables that could be uncovered when they could simply just let some of the crazy shooters go on their planned rampages instead of intervene?</p>

<p>A prime example is when the FBI and local police were able to prevent a massive school shooting in a West Suburban high school in Illinois, where a student had planned(and had the capability) to shoot up the senior graduation. Easily he could have taken out 100+ students, family, and staff with the weapons he had at hand, which would have made headlines and pushed the anti-gun agenda further down American&#39;s throats without the risk of all the variables that are necessary to prove there was a conspiracy to stage the attack at Sandy Hook. If they let that kid shoot the graduation up they kill 2 birds with one stone, and don&#39;t risk being caught. </p>

<p>Would love feedback, because honestly this seems like the biggest hole in your guys theory. </p>

<p>tldr: why stage an attack and risk being caught, when you can just let shooters go willynilly and kill a bunch of people to prove your point that guns are bad</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In January 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Senator Feinstein and 24 Democrat cosponsors introduced S. 150, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 (AWB 2013), into the U.S. Senate.[44][45] The bill was similar to the 1994 ban, but differed in that it used a one-feature test for a firearm to qualify as an assault weapon rather than the two-feature test of the 1994 ban.[46] In addition, it banned: the sale, transfer, importation or manufacture of about 150 named firearms; firearms with &quot;thumbhole stocks&quot; and &quot;bullet buttons&quot;; the importation of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines; and high-capacity ammunition magazines (defined as those capable of holding more than 10 rounds).[46] It grandfathered in weapons legally owned on the day of enactment and exempted more than 2,000 specific firearms &quot;used for hunting or sporting purposes.&quot;[46] It eliminated the sunset clause that was part of the 1994 ban. On March 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a version of the bill along party lines.[47] On April 17, 2013, the Senate voted 60 to 40 against reinstating a ban.[48] --Wikipedia</p>

<p>So, what your saying is that these senators conspired with other people to set up Sandy Hook so that they could only ban weapons that are designed to kill people.  Honestly, this seems like a stretch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen enough evidence that supports the sandy hoax theory.  The videos I&#39;ve watched (i&#39;ve seen them all) really don&#39;t do it.  The german ex police officer doesn&#39;t make enough of a case to satisfy me.  The only two things that seem suspicious to me is the typo on the death certificate and the fact that the kids were all declared dead in the school rather than being taken to a hospital.</p>

<p>My problem with the way it is being approached is that the people you are accusing are the victims of a terrible tragedy.  It&#39;s like telling jews who were in concentration camps that there was no holocaust.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating that we buy the official story hook line and sinker, and I certainly don&#39;t think it&#39;s an appropriate platform for gun grabbers- but to go after the victims based on flimsy evidence like trying to deconstruct &quot;photoshopped&quot; pictures of families or say that someone who was acting strangely at a press conference is therefor a crisis actor, is way over the line.</p>

<p>I know the one father put out documentation of his murdered son, including birth certificate, death certificate and police report, but I never see that brought up in these videos.</p>

<p>I think the conspiracy theorists who think that everything is a fake drill end up making the rest of us look less reasoned.</p>

<p>AGAIN- &gt; I&#39;m not advocating that we buy the official story hook line and sinker</p>

<p>Questioning and positing theories is one thing.  But you are promoting a theory as fact, and frankly the crisis actor theory doesn&#39;t have much evidence to stand on.  That is the problem.  You are actively accusing victims.</p>

<p>There has always been infighting among conspiracy theorists for this reason.  You get so busy pointing fingers and defending yourself from people who call you crazy that some people become insular and think that anyone who criticizes their idea is &quot;shilling&quot;- weak hostility.  We also attract a lot of mental illness and racism because our perspective IS a blaming technique innate to a victim mentality.  I personally think that&#39;s important to filter because it makes me &quot;guilty by association&quot;</p>

<p>Posit your theories.  Don&#39;t do so in such a definitive manner.  Don&#39;t assume I&#39;m a shill because I accuse you of being insensitive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s suspicious that the parents weren&#39;t invited to identify their kids immediately.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s suspicious that Adam Lanza looks similar to his brother.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s suspicious that some of the kids escaped to some random neighbor&#39;s house.  It doesn&#39;t strike me as evidence of a hoax that the names of all the victims weren&#39;t published or that the 911 calls weren&#39;t immediately released or that the nurse only heard 5 shots or that Adam Lanza &quot;wasn&#39;t big enough to wear body armor and carry those guns&quot; or that the &quot;picture of his house from the outside couldn&#39;t possibly be the same house in the pictures of his room&quot;, or that there were originally some discrepancies about his mother&#39;s relationship with the school or that the school got torn down.</p>

<p>None of that strikes me as evidence of a hoax instigated by crisis actors/spooks who were all living in a fake town.  I&#39;m not saying that couldn&#39;t happen.  I&#39;m saying that it probably didn&#39;t and that the evidence presented isn&#39;t enough to accuse people of anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Everyone deserves equal treatment under the law. <em>Respect</em> is an entirely different game. You can lose respect, and you <em>should</em> lose respect for certain actions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t respect Hitler, Stalin, or Mao Zedong. I don&#39;t respect convicted child rapists, I don&#39;t respect child porn dealers, I don&#39;t respect serial killers, etc. </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t respect people who harass grieving families by telling them their dead children never existed. It&#39;s disgusting and not deserving of respect in my opinion. Whether you think the government planned it or not is an entirely different matter and I respect differing opinions. But the fact is, children and adults are dead from Sandy Hook and their parents and family members are grieving over a tragic loss. It&#39;s <strong>never</strong> OK to harass them over whatever &quot;suspicions&quot; you may have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Equal treatment under law is based on the flawed premises that all men are created equal and that men must exist under law. Respect IS a different game  because it neither requires uniformity nor submission. </p>

<p>As it is you can appear to lose your false equality because the law&#39;s authority is not distributed equally. Some men are more equal than others and they get to decide just how much less equal everyone else is.</p>

<p>Respect isn&#39;t synonymous with approval, morality is relative, and individuals&#39; actions cannot be judged separately from the society in which they were reared. </p>

<p>You appear to know something that I do not know. This is the fact you aforementioned. I still have yet to see any evidence presented of dead people as Sandy Hook. All I&#39;ve seen is some highly publicized grieving, loads of politicization, and a concerted effort to stop any independent investigation of the alleged crime. </p>

<p>I mean, they even bulldozed the school. It seems very suspicious to me.</p>

<p>Respect should be given freely. I respect in accord with the golden rule. I&#39;m as capable of mistakes as anyone. Misdeeds are assessed relatively. I don&#39;t condone harassment but I also don&#39;t condone lying. I particularly don&#39;t condone disrespecting anyone or anything for any reason. Love or hate them all you like but do so with a healthy dose of respect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally would like to know some other people&#39;s opinions on the various strange photographs released in the media during the time of this event.</p>

<p>There was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8MTUsz5vto">Parker family portrait</a> (warning, loud intro), where the youngest girl&#39;s hand is distorted or misshapen in some way, <del>and a leg is missing</del> one of her legs is missing and both her sister&#39;s legs are missing. The girl on the left is making the devil horn (or whatever you call it) symbol with her hand, and the young one on the right is making the same symbol by putting her two middle fingers in her mouth. In the picture with Obama the girl also has these two fingers in the mouth making the same symbol.</p>

<p>There was the photo of <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VvTJe9pOUpA/UqjL5jfEyaI/AAAAAAAAGZA/RSZ7oSMxHw8/s640/newtown-sandy-hook-victoria-soto.jpg">Viki Soto</a> in the news with that old guy throwing up the same symbol.</p>

<p>Are there others I am missing? What are your thoughts on these photos?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The one with her hand in her mouth looks totally natural to me, just an awkward angle is all.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you not see the white leggings the middle girl is wearing? She&#39;s sitting on her father&#39;s lap like you would a horse. One leg on either side. </p>

<p>and as for the girl on the left, her legs aren&#39;t visible, but they can easily be behind the middle girl. She&#39;s sitting with both of her legs in between the father&#39;s legs. Just because they&#39;re hidden from view doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t there. Look at my drawing again, her sitting with her legs behind the middle girl is totally natural and possible is it not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did my drawing of the hand not clear it up? It looks like I would expect it to. Her palm is facing the camera, and she&#39;s bending her middle and ring finger back with her mouth. Children have flexible hands, maybe that&#39;s why it looks strange to you.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m sorry, but I can clearly see both legs of the girl in the middle. I cannot understand why you can&#39;t see it. Let me try drawing it again: <a href="http://imgur.com/E7dtCea">http://imgur.com/E7dtCea</a>
She is wearing white leggings and HER right leg, the one on our LEFT of the photo, is in between her father&#39;s legs. Both legs are clearly visible.</p>

<p>As for the other girl, yes her legs are not visible in the photos, but that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist. Her legs could be easily hidden behind the middle girl in two ways that I see: <a href="http://imgur.com/vd0Md9V">http://imgur.com/vd0Md9V</a>

<p>The middle girl is sitting like this: <a href="http://imgur.com/2qwCxcY">http://imgur.com/2qwCxcY</a></p>

<p>And you&#39;re right. The other girls legs are not visible in the photo. If I put my arm around my friend&#39;s back for a photo, my arm doesn&#39;t cease to exist. I truly don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so difficult to believe her legs are off to the side, behind her sister. Torso&#39;s are flexible, she can be pointing forward for the camera with her upper body and have her legs off to the side. Similar to this: <a href="http://imgur.com/YzM0Xuq">http://imgur.com/YzM0Xuq</a>
Or who knows, maybe her legs are folded up beneath her? She&#39;s wearing a dress for God&#39;s sake, that tends to cover up the leg area. </p>

<p>And if you want to end it here, that&#39;s fine. If you can&#39;t see what I&#39;m saying, we can agree to disagree, because I can&#39;t see what you&#39;re saying either. haha. But we&#39;ll just let everyone else make up their own minds I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The girl&#39;s palm is clearly facing the camera. That&#39;s why it looks weird. It is hard to tell but I count two white stockinged legs and I can easily imagine the other girl is sitting sidesaddle in the man&#39;s lap.</p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned about the coverup of sandy hook but I think this is stretching the allegations of intentional symbology pretty far. Something is up but this isn&#39;t it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that hand symbol is not necessarily a satanic thing. It&#39;s a masonic thing, there are photos of many US presidents throwing this hand symbol up in public as well. Perhaps symbolism like this is included so those in the know will be clued in that this event was brought to you by this group.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that the freemason lodge was just across the way from the elementary school, and that guy who was running thru the woods was running <em>toward</em> it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, yes, I know all about the occult. I know about it more than most. Don&#39;t feed the trolls, don&#39;t feed their ego. Truth will not be found in symbolism, truth will be found in facts. Tell someone, most lay people, that these people are throwing up Illuminati signs. They will say your crazy, tell them the facts and you will move hearts and minds. Less occult, more facts. There are plenty there, but these people are so obsessed with symbols and occultism it&#39;s scary. People aren&#39;t the devil, nor are they gods or aliens. Step back from that. The truth will set you free.</p>

<p>This symbol is super common in Christian evangelical groups and really, churches in general. Awakening retreats like it too. It probably started by some pastor cleverly wishing to subvert and christianize the traditional satan hand symbol hard rock uses. </p>

<p>Basically, people saying, I love you, with the symbol. Also, the little girl has her hand flipped palm out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was reported over the police scanner on the day of the shooting that two people wearing ski masks were driving a purple van with unknown plates and may have been related to the shooting. A minute or two later in the same recording, they followed this up by saying that one of them may be wearing a nun outfit and reconfirmed that they&#39;re driving a purple van. None of this was ever explained or elaborated on afterwards to my knowledge - it&#39;s one of those things that just sort of &quot;disappeared down the memory hole&quot;, so to speak.</p>
