       Albert N. Stubblebine III is a retired Major General in the United States Army. He was the commanding general of the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command from 1981 to 1984.  In this compelling interview, Stubblemine reveals the following information (what he calls “dots”) about the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001:
      </p>
      <p>
       Stubblebine initially believed the official story regarding 9/11.
Then, he saw the hole in the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       He can prove that the Pentagon was not hit by a Boeing 757. DOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the sensors around the Pentagon were turned off except one. That one sensor captured an image of the object the hit the Pentagon.  It looked like a missile.  But, after he went public, the imagery was changed to look like a plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The collapse of the twin towers was caused by controlled demolition – not the fuel from the airplane. DOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Larry Silverstein, the lease holder of the WTC complex, admitted that that building 7, which was not hit by a plane and had only a small fire, was intentionally “pulled” – which is phraseology used for controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the air defense systems around Washington DC were turned off that day. DOT.
Also on 9/11, there was an exercise designed to mimic an attack on the towers by airplanes.  DOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you connect the DOTs, the picture says that what we were told by the media was not the real story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stubblebine, visibly upset, describes how he felt when he realized the truth about his government after having a strong belief in his country since early childhood: “My belief system was so strong from age five when I could remember standing on a parade ground at attention with not anybody telling me to do that – at West Point.”

       Alright, let us first consider the source. The header: "Zionism, Jewish extremism and a few other nasty items making our world uninhabitable today." Already we have presumptions going in, and makes the entire article suspicious of manipulation and deception. It's also way too much info for me to sift through, but I'll still consider what you quoted.

      <p>
       So not involved in the any official position involved in 9/11. OK, so I'll hear out his speculations.

       OK, to prove something you need evidence.

      <p>
       I see no reason to believe he was referring to some 'controlled demolition.' To me, it sounded like he was saying to 'pull' the firefighters. Either way, what phrasing he chose is not proof of anything unless he specifically mentioned a controlled demolition.

        <a href="http://www.twf.org/News/Y2003/01-PBPR.pdf">
         the aircraft frame most certainly was destroyed before it had traveled a distance that approximately equaled the length of the aircraft (p. 40)
        </a>
        ", and that "it is highly unlikely that any significant portion of the fuselage could have retained structural integrity at this point in its travel (p. 40)", can you explain what caused the most perfectly round exit hole in the outer wall of the C-Ring?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        QUESTION: Given that the maximum fluctuation between the two cameras would translate in a difference of 25 feet in the position of the plane, can you provide a valid explanation for the large discrepancy between the two corresponding frames (23:19)? Absent a valid explanation for this discrepancy, we must conclude that at least one of the two frames is the result of intentional manipulation, or "photoshopping".

       19 alleged terrorists (
       <em>
        to be referred just as terrorists from now on
       </em>
       ) were able to avoid hundreds of airport CCTVs, except 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of those 3,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">

       </a>
       poses a serious problem:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        At least until the date of the 9/11, all of the CCTVs available (
        <em>
         including the Pentagons'
        </em>
        ) only recorded at 1-5FPS and had timestamps while the
        <em>
         Dulles
        </em>
        was recording at +12FPS(
        <em>
         if I am not mistaken
        </em>
        ) and has no timestamp.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The airports, which the terrorists used, have hundreds of CCTVs that cover the entrances and all of the public areas, yet only 1 camera from 2 airports (
       <em>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">
         Dulles

       </em>
       ) were able to capture 6 of the 19 terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The airplane victims were also never captured by the airport CCTVs. In contrast, here is the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Ie1uLT5AA">
        constant tracking via CCTV of the navy yard shooting
       </a>
       using all the CCTVs that captured the shooter outside and inside the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow the Logan airport failed to record a single victim and/or terrorist.

       <strong>
        THE HIJACKS
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Every pilot and co-pilot is instructed with transponder squawk codes, one of them -
       <em>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UZiQUNl76M&amp;amp;t=46">

        hijacking
       </a>
       and it takes 3s to input and send.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite having 4 pilots and 4 co-pilots, not one of them sent out the 3s squawk as they were instructed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alleged Flight11's FDR shows that
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzR-q0ijbV0&amp;amp;t=251">
        the airplane was too high
       </a>
       to have struck the lamp posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Todd Beamer, one of Flight93's passenger, described the hijack occuring as he was speaking (
       <em>

         Fuel leaking from tank damage or engine damage: Not possible, it didn't catch fire when the airplane exploded, the

        THE PENNSYLVANIA
       </em>
       ---------------------------
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the entire airplane allegedly plunged into the ground, one of the
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CvyJNQw.png">
        engines jumped to a considerable distance from the crash site
       </a>
       . This engine was attached to the same airplane as the other one, diving at the same speed as the other one and hitting the same ground as the other one, yet one of the engines was buried and the other landed far away for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The engine that was buried under the ground was
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4IcZzuY.jpg">
        compressed along it's length under
       </a>
       ~3 and half feet of dirt. This engine had a
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/r0dxyQB.jpg">
        clam shell
       </a>
       of considerable proportions, but for some reason not one part of that shell is present in the previously linked photo of the engine.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were debris found at such a distance from the impact point of the airplane that it could not have been covered from its explosion, this path of debris suggests that the airplane was actually
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dmTLqpx.gif">
        flying on the opposite direction
       </a>
       and not the one officially told. This also fits
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TF5vSXo.png">
        Val MacClatchey's testimony of the plane path
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Val MacClatchey's famous photo poses a serious problem, it displays a mushroom cloud that
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/P0bEagi.jpg">
        is consistent with an explosion and not with a jet crash.
       </a>
       When an airplane crashes it produces a long column of smoke, not just a mushroom cloud. The lack of typical airplane crash aftermath smoke has also been confirmed by
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frtqTM5rUes">
        another witness

      </ul>
      <p>
       These calls were made from the airplane's airphone destined to two different interfaces: One was to the GTE's assistant landline telephone, the other was to a cellphone.
      </p>
      <p>
       These calls could not have remained connected by a system mistake because airphones charge per time, the system was built to only count the time the client is connected in order to avoid overcharging him by allowing calls to "stay connected" when they were not. The fact that they also disconnected at different times rules out any possible system fault which, if possible, would at best disconnect both calls at the same time since they would have "disconnected" at the same time, the time of the crash.

       The
       <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/ACARS-CONFIRMED-911-AIRCRAFT-AIRBORNE-LONG-AFTER-CRASH.html">
        ACARS data also corroborates the above
       </a>
       , seen that the only possible explanation for the calls to remain connected after the airplane crashed is that the airplane from where the calls came from never crashed in the first place.

       Like I said, if you want to hit me with your best single claim, I would be happy to respond. Show me your best single claim, along with evidence to back it up, and I will be happy to provide a reply. I simply don't have the time to respond to these walls of text you're copy/pasting.

       can you give me a %, of the possibility that 9/11 was a false flag?

       I see no benefit to putting a percentage on that, that's just meaningless speculation. The only thing I can tell you is this: I see zero evidence for the claim that 9/11 was a false flag. Every claim I've looked into has been more than sufficiently debunked.

       So can you give me whatever single conspiratorial claim you think is most compelling in regards to 9/11 being a false flag?
