<p>Just as a group of christians is likely to hound me on a christian based site and in real life, the same happens to christians here.  One of the few places really.

    <div class="md"><p>There was that asian chef dude on that Joe Rogan show, forget his name, he makes like asian street vendor food all trendy in NY. He said the TED people groom each speaker for like 16 hours a day and make each speaker go and participate in all these social functions and get togethers, they definitely have an agenda. TED talks always seemed like pop-science bullshit to me, where the audience is basically lulled into thinking they are smart enough to gain insight into incredibly complex things from an hour of engaging speech. And then praised for it. &quot;Oh, you are so smart audience member for listening to us. Come back for more.&quot; It&#39;s cult shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>pay attention to the TED talks speaker&#39;s hand movements. This is called Neuro-Linguistic programming, and connects your subconscious to the ideas given by specific hand movements during specific phrases and point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I studied NLP (Neuro-Linguistic programming) for quite some time, and while NLP does offer an explanation of his hand gestures -- he&#39;s not a master practitioner using some mind control technique.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s simply gesturing toward his own internal representation of his thoughts.</p>

<p>If you want to see some masterful use of NLP and Ericksonian hypnosis, you need look no further than Fox News.  Not only do they masterfully employ hidden commands (repeating <strong>&quot;accuse 911 hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui&quot;</strong> while going full-screen with the man&#39;s image), but the crawl at the bottom of the screen combined with the spoken word -- actually <em>is</em> masterful use of NLP in a mind-control context.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just Fox News.  It&#39;s all of them -- but Fox is so blatant it&#39;s pitiful.</p>

<p>To better understand what NLP actually is, check out any of Richard Bandler&#39;s early work (written, audio and especially video).  He&#39;s since moved on to bigger and better things but as he says &quot;there are so many people stuck at different levels of <em>my</em> development&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religions are mythology. All seek to explain the phenomena we&#39;re experiencing as life/existence. Like most religions, Christianity is based on astrotheology. Unfortunately, in this dark age of modern existence, nobody remembers the purpose behind the myth and ritual. We put too much faith in science. Science is fantastic, but it can only reveal the material world to us. It is thus far incapable of enlightening us as to the mysteries of our internal lives - the mystery of consciousness. Consider this: if the material is the only source of validation, then most of your life isn&#39;t real. Consider further: if your consciousness is nothing but a byproduct of chemical/electrical interactions in your brain, then there is no free will, and every thought you have had was predetermined by the chemical/electrical interactions that preceded it all the way back to your conception... Thats fate, a thought no materialist likes to entertain (but perhaps they don&#39;t have a choice lol). </p>

<p>I agree with the earlier comment that religions are silly, but we must understand that it is our misunderstanding that makes them silly. Granted, the authorities of religion are propagating these misunderstandings, but my point stands, and that is: that religion, as a spiritual experience, is necessary for human beings. It is equally as foolish and ignorant to place blind faith in material science, as to place blind faith in an authoritative religion. Sadly, it is in vogue these days to do so, and so I come here, with this lengthy post, doing what I feel is part to expand the awareness of whoever cares to hear. </p>

<p>At one point, religion, science, and art were one. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because we need stories! A human life <em>is</em> a story. If you dismantle the context for people having myths, then they turn to television and hollywood and are never satisfied or able to be real adults. Look where the adolescent mindset has gotten this country. </p>

<p>As far as myth enabling oppression and exploitation, I think you&#39;re focusing on a very narrow aspect of SOME applications of SOME religions, which is missing what I&#39;m saying. And there is plenty of oppression and exploitation in states without dogma--look at china and russia&#39;s past. America is increasingly atheist or less interested in religion(and our leaders clearly don&#39;t follow the bible despite what they claim during campaign season) and I&#39;d say we&#39;re the number 1 oppressors and exploiters of the world. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why not both?  </p>

<p>In a chaotic system like you&#39;ve described, initial conditions and interactions make long-term prediction incalculable.  And perhaps it is that incalculability that we call free will?</p>

<p>A justification if you will, for that which transcends human understanding (that&#39;s Campbell&#39;s definition of God btw: that which transcends human understanding).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>religion, as a spiritual experience, is necessary for human beings</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think spiritual experience is necessary for human beings, but that religion is not.</p>

<p>I will state confidently that there is no God in the traditional sense.  Yet I live a very spiritual existence.  I sense that there are meaningful coincidences and I live my life as if those serendipitous experiences are as real as the nose on my face.</p>

<p>But the religious myths just lose their power to inspire once their assertions prove to be incompatible with those things we know to be true.</p>

<p>Apollo can&#39;t be pulling the sun across the sky because we now know a bit about orbital mechanics.  And very likely the God of the old testament was volcanoes.</p>

<p>And yet prayer seems to work -- probably through a combination of confirmation bias and simply talking to ourselves to sharpen our concept of what it is we most care about.  But it does seem to help.</p>

<p>Who cares if we&#39;re just talking to ourselves if it provides us comfort, hope, and maybe a little magic? </p>

However, I do believe in a much larger (perhaps Jungian, or Campbell-esque) concept of God - to me, it is a totality; simultaneously the sum of all material and immaterial phenomena in the universe, and the inconceivable and invisible source of this phenomenal existence. To the native Americans, it was the Great Spirit; to the Hindus, Brahman; to secular man, the Cosmos... All mythologies are trying to explain the same thing, just with different sets of symbols. That&#39;s what religion is, a set of coherent symbols for conceiving the inconceivable. To me, the most important thing is for people to identify with their spirit, their consciousness, their inner divinity - whatever you want to call that piece of us which is in this world but not of it. When we do that, we move beyond fear of death. When we move beyond fear of death, we begin to see the irrationality and futility of possession and greed. And when enough of us do that, this world will be a better a place. </p>

<p>Well, this reply ended up being much longer than intended, but I hope it&#39;s well received. Cheers! </p>

But there are so many topics from so many people from so many industries that I don&#39;t think you can apply any one thing you perceive to all of them. Like the use of NLP. Do you really think all of those people giving the speeches are trained in NLP? That&#39;s not something you can just do after a few minutes of practice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe what you say about NLP. One could argue the extant to which it is used in the media, real world, or even if it is real itself...but to state that you must be a trained handler to &quot;know how to do this&quot; is a flat out lie. Any sales rep or anyone who presents anything for a living knows what to do with your hands. It is a common realization when you start presenting..hey I have hands I can&#39;t just leave them hanging here they look awkward during my presentation what should I do? A good presenter learns how to draw an audience in and use every body action to accentuate what is being said.</p>

<p>Now some call this action NLP..which may be true pending on what you mean by NLP..but to state that you must be a trained handler to know how to accompany your speech with appropriate hand and body movements is absolutely absurd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Wrong. Neuro-linguistic programming is a specific movement of hands and implying of speech to subconsciously promote presented ideas.</p>

<p>It is NOT the same as moving your hands while speaking (which is natural) , or even selling a product. (Which can be purposely done.) </p>
