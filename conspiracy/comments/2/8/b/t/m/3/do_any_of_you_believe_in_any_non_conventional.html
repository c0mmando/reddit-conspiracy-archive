       Does anyone have their own personal conspiracy theories they think hold merit, or believe in a conspiracy that isn't widespread? I'm interested in hearing about topics that not might normally be covered on this subreddit, especially theories you might have formulated yourself..

       There's a bunch. The founding of the Federal Reserve, the USS Liberty incident, the events leading us to war such as the Gulf of Tonkin, the Balfour Declaration, The Business Plot, the Lavon Affair, or pretty much anything else past WW2 that was super shady like Operation Northwoods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, all the events that are covered are pretty one sided. None of my history books told me about how Lincoln strictly limited the freedom of the press. They also gloss over the Japanese internment camps, not doing them any justice at all. They make it sound like a handful of immigrants were arrested.

       That's really interesting and very plausible. It might even be that this is not the result of any deliberate act by any groups or individuals, and simply the way our society has evolved in order to ensure its survival.

       The education we receive is largely decentralized, many parties have say in what happens. The federal DOE standards are a joke, leaving much leeway for local discretion. So yes, this makes it difficult to steer it towards any one specific agenda.

       The problem is that almost all those parties who have a say, have something in common. None of them benefit from a truly informed and aware citizen. This evolution you describe is geared towards ensuring the survival of the power structure, not society itself.

       I believe more and more of political appearances in the last decade or so have been CGI.
      </p>
      <p>
       During Dumbya's first 6 months in office, the stock market would tank every time he spoke in public.  Because of this, there was an actual Bush whitehouse rule that he was no longer allowed to make speeches during business hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around this same time, there was an article on
       <a href="http://www.chipzilla.com/">
        http://www.chipzilla.com/
       </a>
       about a company selling "virtual actor" technology to Hollywood in case an actor died towards the end of shooting a movie.  Basically the software needed a good audio &amp; video sample of the actor from scenes that had already been filmed and the computers could fill in the rest from the script.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe they started using this technology for Bush in 2002-2003.  He started making public appearances during business hours again, but not as catastrophically.  Also, it was noticed that "he" didn't blink.  The official explanation for this is that is was because of his glaucoma.  In his second term this was over-corrected for awhile, and he started blinking like crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure many have noticed McCain's positions shifted dramatically at the start of the Iraq war.  I'm guessing he probably died (or was killed) in 2003 and we've been watching a CGI character since then.  If the real McCain is dead, this means there is no danger of him speaking up and saying the CGI isn't him.

       I honestly believe that the ancient astronaut theory holds more water than any religion on this planet. Since there are literally billions of religious folks in the world, it would be safe to assume that this theory should be taken more seriously than it currently is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to say i truely believe in it, im just saying that it makes more sense. There are definately some troubling holes and controversial tendencies, but, imo, not nearly as many as with many religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, i tend to believe that the "head of the beast" is the pharmaceutical companies. I tend to connect them with the involvement with the bankers as well as government leaders, if not only just because of the shear massive amount of wealth they accrue through various less-than-honorable technics and methods, then also with their connections with the lawmakers amd their superhuman ability to seemingly be above the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Related to that last one is a theory concerning the war on drugs, psychedelics to be more precise. I believe psychedelics literally exercise your third mind and helps one towards the road to enlightenment.  An Enlightened population is exponentislly harder to subjugate and enslave than an apathetically ignorant population, thus, they must remain illegal in order for TPTB to achieve their goals...

       Interested in some ancient alien ideas. I have thought since I was young that we may have been planted here by Martians who knew mars would be destroyed. What would we do if we knew our electromagnetic field around earth were to die someday? Probably send our genetic ancestors at the most basic level(soup of life) to any nearby hospitable planet.

       Well its definately my favorite topic to ponder over. Ill give you a summary of my reseafch findings, so buckle up. This may be long ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the ancient astronaut theories (aka ancient aliens, like the show) stems from the translation of the ancient texts of the ("officially" recognized) oldest civilization in human history. Several thousand years before the egyptians were the people of the land of Sumer, the Sumerians.
      </p>
      <p>
       They provided mankind with many firsts, btw. The first agriculture, first city, first laws, first economy, first animal and plant husbandry, first marriages, first divorces, justice system, education system, sewage systems, plumbing, etc etc etc. The list goes on, literally into the thousands of "firsts" ever. And, anthropology/evolutionarily wise, overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, it is their texts (another first) that really sprouted the ancient astronaut theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think that the flood myth first arose from the bible? Think again. It originated with the sumerians, as well as thousands of other cultures all over the world, basically saying the same thing, supposedly on their own accord since there wasnt supposed to be any possible interaction between said cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is most intriguing in their texts is what they call the annunaki. "Those who from the heavens came."
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill try to keep this as short as i can:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          the annunaki is a race of beings from the planet niburu. The atmosphere began to deteriorate (much like ours is now), and they knew that the most efficient way to fix it is by using gold. (Which, todays modern technology and scientists admit that if you were to take gold and make it into a very fine dust and shoot it in the atmosphere, it will stay aloft indefinately and fix a lot of issues with the atmosphere). However, there was not enough gold on niburu. So they needed to find somewhere to extract it, and they knew that planet earth was in abundance of gold. So, the king of the annunaki, Anu, sent his two sons, Enlil and Enki to earth on a mission to mine earths gold.
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          Enlil was the ruler of the upper world (egypt, middle east, that area) while Enki was the ruler for the underworld (lower africa). They oversaw the mining operations, which was incredibly arduous and cumbersome and laborious. After many years (the annunaki live thousands of years vs our approx. 80yrs, alledgedly), the annunaki decided it was too much work. They wanted relief. They needed an answer.
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          Enki was the scientist. He was a geneticist. So, he came up with a solution. He would take an already existing earth creature and train them to do the mining. But none were intelligent enough and all were too wild to train. So, he thought up of another solution. He would genetically modify their dna to increase their intelligence, enough to take orders, but not enough to eventually overthrow the annunaki. So, he spliced annunaki genes and whatever creature from earth, and created man, "In our image.". (Yea, that line didnt originate in the bible, either.)
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          Through trial and error, and many errors, he eventually created the Adamu--Mankind. For a long time Man toiled the mines for the annunaki. Enki began to love his creation, and began to teach them (parallel to the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge). This infuriated Enlik and the other annunaki, so, in short, wanted to destroy mankind as they knew they woukd become a threat. So they somehow created or allowed a flood to happen on a global scale to kill all the adamu off. But enki didnt want that to happen, so he gave some a heads up (noah, but in sumer he was called zuisudra) and salvaged a part ofbthe population.
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          When the floods went back to the sea, and they had enough gold, they wanted to go back to nibiru, but nibirus orbit (3600 yrs) prevented them from keaving immediately. Unfortunately the floods had destroyed almost everything, their crop fields, buildings, etc. So, they turned to the adamu for help. They began to teach the adamu everything, agricukture, ethics, astronomy, etc, so they coukd survive long enoughbto return home.
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <em>
        Now, all we have are these texts that describe this incredible knowledge. Yes, even before the ancient egyptians, the sumerians precisely described planets like saturn and uranus, their physical characteristics as well as their orbits. They described how the solar system orignated (in the beginning, earth didnt exist really, there was mars, venus, tiamat, mars (i think), jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune, pluto, and nibiru. Niburus erratic orbit caused it to come close to tiamat, enough so that one of niburus moons crashed into tiamat and calving it to form earth and our moon, as well as the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter).
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        They knew of comets and their orbits, they knew sobmany things in astronomy that only in the past century have modern civilazation actualky discovered. All, alledgedly and by the sumerians own admittance, this knowledge was handed down to them by the annunaki.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is soooooo much more to this theory, i cant possibly provide enough details or information to include it on reddit. There are many books, thousands and thousands of pages, essays, and articles on this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, nonetheless, the credibility is hurt by deniers (especially the religious crowd) and paid scientists and propaganda pushers. Ill admit, some evidence and stuff remains controversial. Some explanations (when you dig deeper) seem a bit more like speculation that factual deducement. Some things are utter nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, take any page in the bible and youll find much more than that. The physical, geological, astronomical, cultural, and genetic evidence far supports the ancient astronaut theories, imo, than any religion on earth. Thats not to say the ancient astronaut theories are 100% correct. They are not. But they are much less wrong than any religion, again, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, ill wrap this up but first ill talk about the genetic evidence. Scientists conducted studies on the human genome fairly recently, and what they found kind of goes along with the AATs.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           Mitochindrial DNA,  or mDNA
          </em>
         </strong>
         -- Scientists studied the mDNA in humans, which is passed down only by the mother, and have concluded that all humans alive today have a common female ancestor who lived roughly around 200,000 yrs ago.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           The Y-Chromosome
          </em>
         </strong>
         -- They have done studied on the y chromosome in humans, and have concluded that all humans alive today have a common male ancestor, also roughly 200,000 yrs ago.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Additionally, they have found that humans have around 240 genes in their genome that exists nowhere else in the animal kingdom. These genes have no ancestry to other genes, and arose, literally, out of nowhere, and all at once, all of a sudden. And, speaking in terms of evolution as is widely understood today, this happened overnight. This is a statistical impossibility of astronomical proportions, for so many useful (or at least non-detrimental) genes to mutate all at once all of a sudden.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There is no official explanation for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this helps introduce you to this topic, and, hopefully, you can see why it fascinates me so much. Of course, i may have, in my haste and carelessness, made a mistake or misrepresentation of the AATs, but at least you get the jist of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont take my word for it. Do the research and, if nothing else, youll find it more interesting than many sci-fi novels. Hope you enjoy it!

       I have never seen a UFO, but I think they may actually be time travel experiments from our future, if they do exist. Not a conspiracy, but maybe just simple humans thinking something is much more mystical than it really is. Government coverup of this would be a conspiracy, though.

       Would a belief in a religious revelation that ostensibly is a claim for the return of Christ, but isn't stated as such before the world overtly as of yet (by the governing bodies of the religion, as well as individual believers), be considered a belief in a "conspiracy theory" outside of mainstream conspiracy theories? For this is part of what I believe (in).
      </p>
      <p>
       I was also deeply immersed in the varying accounts and whistle-blower stories on
       <a href="http://projectcamelotportal.com/">
        project camelot
       </a>
       at one period. Many of these stories and personal accounts I would hold as highly probable if not factual. Many of them are 'out there', read like X-File plots, not in the conspiracy mainstream and are non-falsifiable (mass mind control of the wider populous via tech not in the public domain, UFO's and some ET races are ourselves from future timelines, multiple timelines, stargate technologies, bases already existent on the moon and mars, psychic assassin programs, 'looking glass' devices, underground bases, time-travel experiments, etc). How much of that is "outside the conspiracy theory mainstream"? I personally couldn't prove any of them to be actual and true, but they read and 'sense' as feasible, if not likely and true. As such they inform my worldview until proven otherwise (someone coming forward, who disclosed the original information, and declaring it themselves to be disinformation).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would I believe such things? Mainly because I've been exposed to the profoundly mystical and frankly stranger aspects of shared consensus reality too often and repeatedly. Prosaic and materialistic explanations leave out far too much in my experience. Most of what we're 'in' is a conspiracy imo ('education', 'honest', impartial science and 'accurate' history, media-ted events, secularised institutions, materialism and consumerism, two-faced leaders, who profess a belief in an orthodox religious ideology and practice something else occulted, war-based economies on a pretext that they aren't, and so on). The truth is far stranger than this fiction dressed up as 'truth'; the secular, rational, 'factual' reality we're presented with (edit: there's a place for that, but in my present view it requires a reversal into a subordinate status, or at the least to be measured and weighed inclusive to and alongside the anomalous, the supernatural and paranormal, mysticism and esotericism).

       Every history class I ever took in school never even made it to WWII.  I even took a college history course called US History 1865-Present and we still didn't even get through the Great Depression.  My point being they do not want us to know the history of the 20th century which has had more of an impact on our daily lives than before it.  Just an opinion

       Then your teachers probably suck. I've learned so much in my American History classes through the years !
