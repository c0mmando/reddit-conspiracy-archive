       Jehovah's Witness's talk of a New World Order.  What they are referring to is a new one world government by god.  Not the same thing as an illuminati NWO that is a government by humans.  They think all humans ( including the Rothschild's and illuminati) other than JW's will be destroyed at armageddon and only they will be left on a paradise earth.

       It was based of of this comment.  From the pic that was posted.

       The founders of both "faiths," the Mormons and Jehovah's witnesses, were of the Illuminati bloodline. Charles Taze Russell, who founded the Watchtower Society (Jehovah Witnesses), was of the Illuminati Russell bloodline, which also founded the infamous Skull and Bones Society at Yale University. Charles Taze Russell was a Satanist, a pedophile according to his wife, and a friend of the Rothschilds. Indeed it was the Rothschilds who funded the Jehovah's Witness operation into being, along with other Illuminati bankers, through "contributions" by organizations like the Rothschild-controlled B'nai B'rith. This was proved in a court of law in 1922. One of the key people involved in this was Frank Goldman who later became President of B'nai B'rith. Why would an organization set up (in theory) to help Jewish people and promote the Jewish faith, be funding into existence the Jehovah's Witnesses??? I think the name Rothschild answers the question. Russell was also a high degree Freemason and Knights Templar. He promoted Zionism, another Rothschild creation (see Hitler was a Rothschild), on behalf of his friends and backers.
In his book The Watchtower &amp; the Masons Fritz Springmeier says:
"It has always been disconcerting that the Masons are so adept at smokescreens. The leader of the Anti-Masonic political party in the 1830-1840â€™s turned out to be a Mason. Both C.T. Russell and J. Rutherford printed material that was less than favorable to Freemasonry. And yet I now know that C.T. Russell was a Freemason, a Knights Templar. I also know that Rutherford worked intimately with Freemasons who were his good friends."

       I was born and raised a JW.  I even served for two years at their headquarters in New York.  I am not a JW anymore.  While my own research came up with connections of Charles Taze Russell to things like pyramidology and freemasonry, I can tell you from experience that Jehovah's Witnesses are not political at all.  My parents are early 70's and do not know a single difference between Republicans and Democrats.  It was the same way at the headquarters.  And yes I knew the governing body.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not believe that the JW's have the "truth", but I also do not believe that modern day JW's are connected to an Illuminati plan for world domination.

       As in freemasonry and other social organisations, mainstream followers are ignorant of the roots of the foundation. Trust me, there is much more than meets the eye if you dig deep enough.

       "Satanism" is an overrated buzzword.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occult organisations such as Freemasons, Catholic Church and many others just have a hidden agenda, unknown by all followers exept those at the very top.  "Occult" does not imply satanism, just that the true meaning is hidden.  They do not all identify with "satanism", though some do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freemasonry is known for a secret-within-a-secret-within-a-secret, listen to Bill Cooper's lectures he goes into that aspect in great details.
      </p>
      <p>
       I share your opinion, but I would rephrase as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       They either do not have the "truth" and do not have a hidden agenda, or they do not have the "truth" and have a hidden agenda.

       I believe there is more to it than that ... religion is controlled by higher-ups like any other major social structure ( governments, medias, etc ... ).
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it (religion) is by far the most succesful means of indoctrination, why let a good occasion go to waste?

       Indoctrination yes!  The whole foundation of a religion is IN indoctrination.  That doesn't make it always wrong.  There are plenty of good religions.  They ALL have there downside.  But there are many religions that have their upside.  Lots of people have given up a worse lifestyle in the name of God.  If you think of a world with zero morals no doubt you will imagine a world worse than this one.  Many people have morals.  Where do they get them?  Religion.

       Jehovah's Witness's on an individual level, as well as on an organizational level, are well intentioned.  It lifts people up out off awful lives and gives them better lives.  That does not mean that they have the absolute "truth" though.

       I am pretty much an atheist, does this mean I have no morals? I strive to be respectful, honest and helpful to a fellowmen in need. I am very much involved with World Vision Organisation and have 3 sponsor childs, regardless of my "lack of faith" in a higher power. I don't want to brag, simply demonstrate that religion is not a pre-requisite for moral standards.

       Totally agree with you on this one. If religion helps bring the best out of people at an individual level, so much the better. I don't believe anyone has the "absolute truth", we are way too limited in our primitive mindsets to grasp such a concept.

       Thanks for the discussion, peace to you and loved one.

       I was a rabid atheist after leaving the JW's, so I can relate.  The good hearted atheist replaces morality with ethics.  That is fine because the two share many common values.  The difference is in the power.  Ethics relies on what is deemed to be of the highest value from human terms.  Like you said "we are way too limited in our primitive mindsets" should caution us to not have to much trust in ethics.  But for the one that has complete and utter faith in a higher power/God, morality has a much higher authority.  Thus more power.  There lies the advantage of religion.  But it is not limited to religion.  Spirituality, which is practiced alone has the same power without an organization that can be found fault with.

       Former JW here, or at least raised as one. The only "conspiracy" I know of is the fact that abuse is rampant and covered up. Sexual abuse victims are often harrassed, interrogated, and the ones who do it are excused, swept under the rug.
