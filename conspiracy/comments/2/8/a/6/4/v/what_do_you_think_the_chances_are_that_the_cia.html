       This seemed like the place to go since the theory of the conspiracy by the CIA to create the Taliban and Al qaeda to fight the Russians and then  to frighten Americans is pretty popular.
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep seeing news articles talking about how ISIS is the new "scarier" Al Qaeda and I'm wondering if the intelligence community was coming to realize that Al Qaeda just was not quite scary enough to convince congress to pass the next Patriot act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a thought though.

       Of course the US is connected with ISIS. The concerted way in which the media is pushing the government agenda about "ISIS" is extremely telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that ISIS are the same jihadists that the US was supporting in Syria, and now that Assad has shown them the door, they are creating havoc in Libya and Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key question to ask is who benefits from a Middle Eastern war between Shia and Sunni, and there is one stand out winner - Israel. It would be naive to imagine that Mossad are not trying to play both sides against each other by manufacturing some of the worst atrocities being conducted by ISIS.

       I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about fanatical ancient religions being used as the basis for organizing an army is that they are going to be very easy to manipulate by well-prepared psychiatry savvy agents of whomever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel, despite all the fanatical judaism back in actual israel, is not run by people who actually believe in the religion and are more into the fun of being the fascist rulers of a modern state and all the benefits that provides(i.e. unlimited wealth and total freedom from scrutiny, aka total freedom).
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the past 20 years there have been israeli and american agents building up identities all over iraq, iran, syria, egypt, libya, etc etc et al, to the point that with cia/mossad hq can just dial up the leader of isis, or the syria resistance, or kurdistan, and, of course, the actual government of iraq, and basically order them all to kill each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by now they do all this stuff off budget, to think the pentagon or congress has any ability to cut this stuff off even if they tried is pretty naive.  I mean, these guys have been trafficking the entire output of afganistan's poppy supply for over a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason Washington seems so surprised by all of the recent events is that no one in washington is in control.  George H.W. Bush, his saudi and israeli friends, and some bankers are in control and they just give Ruppert Murdoch a quick heads up when they need more American blood and bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I post in r/conspiracy and not r/worldnews, if it isn't obvious to people that we are ruled as if by kings by secret oligarchy, and that elections and the nbc nightly news are just window dressing to the actual decisions that form history, well, that's what it means to take the red pill in the matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you take it, what 99% of the population is thinking about at a given time might as well be Mr. Rogers Land of Make Believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like do you really think that the carrier George H.W. Bush 'deploying to the region' is coincidence?  It's more like a signature.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I want to know is where that guy is buying land and what is really being done with the huge fortune in stolen funds.  He and his friends could be building a survival earthship in a giant cavern with missing children as slaves and concubines, prepping for the bio-disaster he has been planning since 1992, for all people like us know.

       No, they are the same people with different labels. What I am saying is that the islamist mercenaries (aka Free Syrian Army) who were fighting Assad have been kicked out of Homs in a significant strategic defeat, and some of them have re-emerged in Iraq, now under the aegis of "ISIS".

       Somewhat. Their propaganda outlets give the game away to some extent. Since you
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       western corporate media is propaganda, you can view anything that matches that narrative with a more critical eye. And tend to give more credence to sources that dispute the corporate narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, known liars lead you to the truth.

       Being an engineering student, I'm realizing that everyone has their own spin the news they present, and that the accuracy of the information depends on the "proximity" of whence the news came. Kind of like a RMS sum, the inaccuracy or spin may be linked to the degrees of separation from the direct source of the information. Thanks! I'll be more skeptical henceforth and search for more direct sources.

       news entities are given a script from which to recite? If so, who is administering the script? Surely (hopefully) it isn't the same agency for each news event. I'd hate to think, we're all being media-controlled by a single entity.

       I have this feeling that they aren't formed from the CIA but because of the CIA. We did make alQaeda for Afghanistan but I think this is just a rogue group that is an actual enemy now. They're as bad as some of the African rebel groups.

       Nope just a feeling. Either the media is spinning it a different way/new narrative or these guys are off the rails with no control and an actual big money(now) bad guy group that's looking for dominance. Yeah some things do line up for it to be a narrative like the easy taking of the money and the spread of terror but these guys are mass killing groups, not just getting into firefights. It's all my opinion though and speculative so yeah it's just a 'who knows' point now.

       It's a symbolic name made up by intelligence agencies.  The idea of a secretive group of sunni extremists attempting to install a caliphate has always been neocon propaganda.  This is just a PR campaign to rebrand several loosely affiliated militias operating in the Levant and probably funded by western intelligence.

       I'm suggesting that this is a rebranding of what was previously referred to as "Al Queda" (fairly disparate Sunni extremist militias) by western intelligence and their media lackeys, and that these guys are going to be used to rubbelize turkey, and take out the governments in Syria, Lebanon and Iran.  I'm also suggesting that they didn't refer to themselves as ISIS, and that it's a name that is being applied to them for brand recognition.

        YET ANOTHER PROOF THAT THE HOUSE OF SAUD IS FINANCING THE BEHEADERS IN SYRIA.
This is a shortened version of a video aired by al-Arabiya - which is OWNED by the House of Saud. The original, longer video has been deleted.
Oops! al-Arabiya was "careless" enough to air an itvw with a captured Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) jihadi in Syria.
Question: “Why do you (ISIS) monitor the movements of the Free Syrian Army?”
Jihadi: “I don’t exactly know why, but we received orders from ISIS Command”
Question: “Who among the command at ISIS gave you these orders?”
Jihadi: “Prince Abdulrahman al-Faisal, who is also known as Abu Faisal”
Prince Abdulrahman al-Faisal is none other than the former commander of the Saudi air force.
This explodes once and for all the now much-peddled Western myth of "good" and "bad" al-Qaeda. The jihadi gang as a whole is DIRECTLY commanded by the House of Saud, and we're not talking only about Bandar Bush's goons.

       Interesting, what gets me is that the NSA has already admitted that they are tracking/intercepting all Iraqi communications.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In Iraq, for example, the National Security Agency went from intercepting only about half of enemy signals and taking hours to process them to being able to collect, sort and make available every Iraqi email, text message and phone-location signal in real time, said John “Chris” Inglis, who recently retired as the NSA’s top civilian.

       Greenwald's take is ironic.
      </p>
      <p>
       He thinks the new Iraq crisis happened "in spite of" and not "because of" the NSA owning the entire Iraq telecommunications network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather tragic &amp; curious that Greenwald believes in the existence of a covert state that subverts the Constitutional democratic process -- yet doesn't believe in a Deep State that actively creates covert theatrical staged events like 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see Greenwald as a True Believer.  But this central contradiction of Greenwald's beliefs is truly inexplicable to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       "That the intelligence community would have seen this coming" categorically suggests that they indeed have an interest in the current outcome, if not an active covert role.  Just like 9/11 all over again.

       If I were Glenn Greenwald, I'd avoid 9/11 like the plague. I'd want to maintain an image of credibility and mentioning 9/11 destroys that image in the majority of minds while enhancing it in the minds of a small, but growing minority.

       Yes I think the US/Zionist war machine are connected. I think they are reversing their strategy regarding intervention as well. They know the public are sick of the wars so they might be arming and deploying ISIS to attain their goals while using empty threats of intervention from the sidelines. I'm predicting no roadblocks whatsoever from NATO.

       John McCain wanted the US to arm Isis in Syria to fight Assad's regime, but bomb them in Iraq for seeking a caliphate. He just wants to bomb somebody as a compensation for his treatment in Vietnam.

       Seriously, there's definitely a connection in terms of how these things have been fomented and the CIA is most definitely up their ying yang playing both sides of the fence against the middle (in pools of blood and unnecessary murder and mayham).

       This is a state run operation. These groups that make up ISIS/ISIL have a central comand structure, belief, and logistical operation. In the towns they have taken they have restored order, posted laws, and taken over government infrastructure including policing. The planning required to mobilize a group this large takes money, leadership, guns, fuel, food, and vehicles. This group is sponsored by a state. I find it very hard to imagine that the CIA was completely in the dark about this move. So why wasn't this called out as a potential problem? Because it's all part of the plan. It's much easier to get people to follow along when they are emotionally reacting, rather than intelectually thinking about what is going on.

      <p>
       There is a plan and they are the distraction.

       Wow that oil empire map is really something to think about... I hadn't even considered the possibility of borders being restructured.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, what good would the oil field be to the extremists? Since they've been flagged as terrorists in such a huge way wouldn't doing business with them be almost impossible? I mean... buying oil, even if it's for american cars, from the group that CNN is calling worse that al qaeda 24 hours a day seems like a PR nightmare. Even in Russia...

       I heard on NPR (thursday?) that Turkey suggested creating an autonomous Kurdish state out of North Iraq. The plan seems to be gaining momentum....
      </p>
      <p>
       I was also thinking.... 
-Since the US has absolutly no apetite for reinvading Iraq, 
-and it's proven that air strikes alone cannot win a war, 
-and it's the Maliki governtment who has helped create the political problem with its treatment of Sunni's. (I don't think that the Iraqi government can orgonize itself out of a wet paper bag at the moment. The only thing they have going for them are shear numbers, but definitley not cohesive orgoniziation.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing left is for Iran to step up and offer troops. I think this is a ploy to draw Iran into a Vietnam style conflict that completely saps its resources and attention. They get weak from the fighting after a few years to a decade. Then another false flag when the US has "forgoten" that it doesn't like war. And boom, we invade Iran and the whole mid east.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're mostly right on the oil, but there are always grey/black markets for discount goods. BP or Haliburton subsidiary will buy the cheap oil along the Turkish boarder and then turn arround and introduc it into the system as something they "drilled" for. Easy enough and better margins.

       Really it could any number of groups behind it. Russia, China, U.S.. Until we see how these countries react  and/or benefit  to/from this situation then we will know who was behind it.

       Could Russia have something to do with ISIS? I mean baiting the us into war after war was a plan of soviet Russia as told by a defector (I don't recall his name off the top of my head). It seems as though Russia could be supporting a second front to further stretch our economy, our resolve and what little faith people have in our government. Just a thought

       I don't see it.  ISIS was fighting against Assad's regime which Russia is openly backing.  And after the hell they went through in the Soviet/Afghan war, two Chechen wars and countless terrorist incidents I'm pretty sure Russia hates Islamic extremists even more than we do.  I think it's far more likely the Saudis have something to do with this.

       The CIA might cooperate with ISIS in some areas but not others, or might cooperate as a means to some other end that is to ISIS' disadvantage.
