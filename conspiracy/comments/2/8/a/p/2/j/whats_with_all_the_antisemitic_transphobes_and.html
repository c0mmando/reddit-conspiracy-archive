    <div class="md"><p>1) I understand
2) Good to hear
3) Thats a very good thing. And i see your point about that post you linked to. Honestly, the title to me doesnt seem offensive, though i would admit that it lies within the grey area (at least in my opinion). The video content, however, i cannot say because i dont care enough to watch it. But, considering the issue you are concerned about, i wouldnt be surprised to find that the content in this video is racist. </p>

<p>Being knowledgable about tue difference between jews and zionists help alot in differentiating the racist potential is very helpful. And i do believe you understand the difference, as do i. Also, the theories that this post you linked to is actually concerning the zionists (specifically the zionists who happen to be jewish), and i admit, that does seem to indicate racist tendencies. </p>

<p>Personally, i dont care enough to investigate further. Honestly, i saw this post and just moved on, i didnt even click on the title, as the im not really interested in that topic. So, my disconnect from that kind of explains my indifference to whether or not this is racist material. Thats not to say that i am dismissing your concerns, though. I actually applaud you for the way you went about addressing this. </p>

<p>Often times, actually, almost every time, someone here complains about something being racist, it is because they dont understand the difference between zionism and judaism. So, i hope you understand my original suspicions concerning that. I hope i didnt offend you with that.</p>

<p>And, lastly, i dont think i really need to tell you this seeing how youve mentioned trying hard not to break rule #10 and stuff, but if that post (and maybe others) offended you this much, reporting it to the mods wouldve been best, and i probably wouldve also contacted the OP and ask them to change the title from &quot;<strong><em>Jews</em></strong> run the media&quot; to &quot;<strong><em>Zionists</em></strong> run the media&quot;, and then educate them on the difference, or just simply request him to delete it as it could potential harm the credibility of our sub. (Though, honestly, i dont give a fuck what others think of this sub, i get great value of it whether or not othet people think we are racist, biggots, sexists, crackpots, whatever.)</p>

<p>Again, im not trying to offend you or to downplay your emotions or opinions, as yours are no less important than mine, or anyone elses here for that matter. I just feel differently about this, thats all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to make a few things clear:</p>

<p>If you see that type of content, and believe it is in violation of the rules, please feel free to report it. If you believe a report has been overlooked, or if another user is harassing you and nothing has been done to address the issue, please contact us via modmail by clicking &#39;message the moderators&#39; on the sidebar.</p>

<p>As for anti-semitic content, I do routinely remove content that is legitimately however mildly anti-semitic. Any content that is extremely racist, against any race, anti-semitic or otherwise, will result in an immediate ban, whether that user is simply trolling or is sincerely racist. </p>

<p>To clarify, rule 1 applies to content, primarily comments but also submissions, that use racial slurs in particular, but can also apply to content that is overtly prejudice or racist in general. As a mod, you have to decide between what is considered legitimate rule enforcement and outright censorship. Some users would prefer a &#39;hands off&#39; approach to moderation, to allow the users of the sub to decide which content is acceptable or not. I can certainly respect that, from a freedom of speech standpoint. Others, like yourself, would like to see more rigorous enforcement. Also understandable, in particular when addressing trolls or harassment of any sort. While we don&#39;t tolerate actual racism, if content posted here is simply controversial or perhaps mildly offensive to a vocal minority but does not technically violate the rules, there&#39;s nothing we can or (ethically) should do about that, necessarily, unless you want us to cross the line of engaging in censorship. </p>

<p>Again, it would be helpful if more users actually reported such content they believe actually violates the rules, rather than complaining about it without pointing to any specific examples. And it&#39;s important to remember the report button, like a downvote button (though even moreso) is not a &#39;disagree&#39; button. Simply because one disagrees with a comment or post, does not make it necessary or helpful to report it. I say this because on a daily basis the mod queue will typically have posts reported that are not even remotely close to being a rule violation, reported solely because another user disagrees with it. Not only is this pointless, it in effect makes it more time consuming for us to sort through the actual violations present in the mod queue, as those you mentioned in your post. </p>

<p>As for the &#39;shills&#39;, while it is against the rules to accuse another user directly of being a shill, in the sub, there is no rule against discussing their general existence, nor any concerns you may have regarding the subject. The reason that rule exists is to curb the endless &#39;shill&#39; accusations that would arise in nearly every thread prior to the rule being implemented, due to one user simply disagreeing with another. This is not just counterproductive, it only serves to detract from the credibility of discussing actual corporate and government shills, who are known to be present on just about any large website, even obscure blogs at times. Those that assume such individuals would not bother with reddit are delusional. Reddit is currently one the heaviest trafficked websites on the Internet, a source of news for millions of users, for average users and even journalists alike. It&#39;s rather native, if not disingenuous, to simply dismiss the significance this site has, when one knows actual shills, those who have vested corporate or government interests, have already been confirmed to infiltrate, disrupt and spread propaganda on any website large enough to be considered relevant. But I digress, as a mod, I have personally dealt with certain users who post nothing but such antagonistic content here, but only when those users cross the line of violating the rules. It&#39;s perfectly understandable for some users to be skeptical of certain conspiracies, perhaps even most of them, but those posting here solely to thread crap or attempt to dismiss every conspiracy in the sub, and even complain about topics that aren&#39;t even conspiratorial in nature, it is akin to going to r/christianity and critiquing them for not being atheist, going to r/israel and attacking Zionism day after day, going to r/liberal and calling them libtards, etc. </p>

<p>So yes, we are doing as much as we can to address these issues, while trying not to cross the line of outright censorship. </p>

<p>One element you neglected to mention is those who troll and brigade here. I should also note, as of late, we have been more aggressive in addressing these users, banning more trolls than were prior, those who post here solely to attack the sub and its users, or post here solely to ridicule others without contributing anything of substance. I should note, I have a zero tolerance for such users, as I do for any over-the-top rule 1 / racism violations, and will ban such users on the first offense, whereas most it not all others would be warned prior.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to vouch for this. I am a relatively new user to Reddit, and I am routinely buzzed by these green-coloured enforcers. &quot;Don&#39;t do this!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t do that!&quot; &quot;Stop being funny!&quot; &quot;Stay on topic!&quot;</p>

<p>Haha, just kidding about that last one. Seriously, though, good points there. Thank you for making that clear, I hope someone else reads it besides me, and thee, and that guy who said that I was going to be banned if I made one more &quot;shitpost.&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s a shitpost, anyway? I mentioned that I am new here, right?</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s the thing. From what I understand, the way the rules are written now, anyone is free to write exactly that. &quot;The Jews are destroying the world,&quot; would be fine while, &quot; (Racial slur for Jews) are destroying the world,&quot; would be censored. </p>

<p>There are people looking to discredit the sub, but there are also white nationalists posting here unhindered because of the way the rules are written. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible I&#39;m incorrect, but my understanding is that racist posts won&#39;t be censored here as long as racist slurs aren&#39;t used. </p>

<p>The rule used to be no racism and it was changed. It should be up to the community what it wants. </p>

<p>There are a lot of people who spend all their time on reddit attacking this sub, and it&#39;s a drag to see them have any ammunition. However, many bigger subs don&#39;t even delete racist slurs and there are no concerted efforts to harass r/videos, for example, of doing just that. </p>

<p>There are a lot of agendas at play and I certainly don&#39;t envy the mods.</p>

<p>So we end up in a situation where we aren&#39;t allowed to talk about sensitive subjects without some group that would rather us not talk about it, coming in here to complain about racism.</p>

<p>This is why we now allow discussion about racial issues and religious issues as long as those involved do not use slurs or other language where the intent is to offend that group.  That doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t allowed to offend anyone, that means you aren&#39;t allowed to grief them by intentionally or grievously slandering them based upon their race religion social-order or creed.</p>
