       Susan Lindauer, a CIA Asset for many years, brokered a fully functional peace solution with Iraqi diplomats to avoid the US occupation of Iraq. It
       <strong>
        <em>
         included
        </em>
       </strong>
       sweeping WMD searches. She physically delivered this to
       <strong>
        <em>
         Colin Powell's home
        </em>
       </strong>
       on more than one occasion. It was ignored, she was arrested and sent to a prison in Texas without a trial under the Patriot Act using "secret evidence," and the war-happy politicians then proceeded to invade Iraq without any salient objective...
      </p>
      <p>
       The Iraq war stressed the US economy until we finally tipped to a breaking point and the housing market (and the rest of the US economy) collapsed sharply. The Wall Street bankers are partially to blame for our current predicament, obviously. Their trading practices were lacking critical oversight for years and technical trading systems exploited otherwise trivial market fluctuations regularly. But the real blame falls on those in power who refused
       <em>
        all available diplomatic options
       </em>
       to proceed with a military option in Iraq because the military wheels were already turning. Every day, we're now tallying the cost of this failure of leadership in terms of
       <em>
        human lives lost
       </em>
       and
       <strong>
        <em>
         trillions of dollars wasted

       </strong>
       when we have absolutely

        <em>
         NO
        </em>
       </strong>
       capacity to spend any more money right now. Oh... and our reputation in the world as good, creative people just happens to have been demolished, shattered, and destroyed, by the way.

        this book
       </a>
       on how the Patriot Act was used to silence a
       <em>
        highly efficient CIA asset,
       </em>
       named Susan Lindauer, who successfully brokered a peace deal with Iraqi diplomats before our administration decided to bomb Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iraqi diplomats helped the asset craft the non-violent solution which included
       <strong>
        <em>
         full cooperation
        </em>
       </strong>
       with weapons inspectors (they had invited the FBI openly for several years to set up a task force inside the county... which they never did). Iraq also guaranteed priority oil rights for US oil corporations as well as a pledge that Iraq would buy at least

       </em>
       to John McCain's staff while McCain was touring television studios around the country vomiting out campaign-related talking points about a "breakdown in the intelligence community before and after 9/11." The asset, Susan Lindauer, was aware of an impending attack several months before 9/11 and warned everyone she spoke to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to travel to New York because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit, I'm not one for conspiracy theories. Honestly, I'm not. So you can imagine my surprise when everything Lindauer said in her book was both logical
       <em>
        and checked out
       </em>
       after I did some digging on my own. Please read the book if you're so compelled and see if your own conclusions share my surprise. Right now, to me, it seems our politicians are concerned with good campaign publicity and securing huge wartime military contracts for companies in their constituencies rather than confronting the truth that modern warfare comes with a price tag of human life and trillions of dollars we simply
       <strong>
        <em>
         cannot spend right now
        </em>
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw someone posted an AMA request for Susan recently. But I just really feel like this needs more attention, which is why I'm posting it. Please comment or share or upvote or... do whatever you want with it. Just look into it in some capacity... please.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a rational, logical American and I'm genuinely concerned I didn't hear about this story sooner.

       One of Susan's CIA "handlers" was Dr. Richard Fuisz. The reason I mention it is because the DOJ didn't believe the asset operated with the CIA but was an Iraqi agent, instead. This person's history in the Middle East was validated by both his

       . The issue concerning the sale of SCUD missile launchers to Iraq pre-Gulf War in the NYT article was included in the book as a means to validate the asset's relationship with her "handler" and also to disprove the notion that her work with her CIA handlers was imagined or was some result of a fantastic delusion spanning over a decade.

       is a copy of some of the many court ordered psychiatric evaluations displaying rather plainly that she was of a perfectly sound mind and lacked any sort of psychosis or delusions (as was put forward initially to keep her from going to trial-- rather, she was remanded to a Texas prison for an unspecified amount of time for psychiatric evaluations).

       <p>
        Here is a motion submitted by her third attorney to counter the government's claim that she was mentally unfit to stand trial.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Just to be clear, her first two attorneys agreed that she was unfit to stand trial. In fact, it was her attorney that insisted that she be examined by a psychiatrist. Both the government-appointed psychiatrist and two defense-chosen psychiatrists agreed that she was crazy. The government then asked for a court order to force her to be medicated so that she would be sane enough—they hoped—to stand trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two separate federal judges agreed that she was crazy, but refused to order the medication. You can read one of the decisions here:
       <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17352362648182906720&amp;amp;q=susan+lindauer&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=40000003">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read the decision, it contains pretty strong evidence from the psychiatrists that she's nuts. They found that she has been having delusions since she was a child—apparently as young as age 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New York Times reporter also found many of her acquaintances thought she was crazy, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, if you read her book, you will have read the story she recounts of a random old Arab who sits next to her on a park bench in London in 1986 and tells her about the future and induces visions in her of the plane exploding over Lockerbie, Scotland (which didn't happen until 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       She actually believes that this happened. If she tells stories like that in her book, how can you believe anything she says?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a sample of her delusions:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dr. Drob, the defense psychologist, based his conclusions solely on interviews with Lindauer, and reported only grandiose delusions, although he did report her claim that the government fabricated documents in connection with the current case. He noted that defendant is adamant that she is in fact "an important government operative and that all her actions were in fact sanctioned by the intelligence branches of the United States government." She was, she claimed, a "back door channel between the U.S. and Iraq." He said that she insisted also she is owed and was cheated out of millions of dollars for negotiating with Libya, apparently to secure reparations in connection with the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Although Dr. Drob was resolutely agnostic even as to claims by Lindauer about her involvement in the Lockerbie negotiations, her role in getting weapons inspectors into Iraq, and her involvement in getting President Clinton to prevent a nuclear terrorist act in the United States in 1995, characterizing such claims only as "extremely unlikely", he did conclude that "when Ms. Lindauer begins to speak about her psychic powers it becomes eminently clear that she is delusional, and that the grandiose claims she makes about her participation in government affairs are in all likelihood largely the product of her own psychotically disturbed imagination." He dismissed her claim that she had prophesies about the Iraq war when she was a little girl, and knew days in advance of every specific target in Iraq and every assassination, as "delusional on its face."
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Goldstein, the defense psychiatrist, was somewhat less tentative, dismissing as "classic examples of the grandiose variety" her claims that she was "a preeminent government operative who was not sufficiently appreciated" and had contact with high-level government figures, and was possessed of psychic powers. He reported also that "many of Ms. Lindauer's delusions are classic examples of the persecutory type".

       I remember that passage -- early in the book. Were there more? I don't remember others. Prove to me that she was not having sponsored discussions (aka getting a paycheck from an office billing directly to the US govt) with iraqi diplomats in an attempt to end the smoldering climate between the US firestarters and the Iraqi diplomats.
       <em>
        Then
       </em>
       we can talk. If I remember correctly, she states in the book outright that at least one judge agrees she's crazy (or two or more). That fact does nothing to allay my fear that it was an inaccurate ruling. Judges are pieced together with glue and barely recognizable social shavings. Further, they tend to adopt an infallible conviction by means of the trade. As a habit. I can compare it to priesthood, most readily. But we know full well priests never act in the name of their own interests.......

       The ability to convey youthful idealism as irresponsible/dangerous adult behavior
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/28a46q/the_us_government_is_actively_tracking_those_who/">
        is quite possible and more and more common.
       </a>
       Makes me wonder why you're saying this here, matter of fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me. How hard would it be to direct someone to find a solution with a hostile nation through industrial means rather than military means and then arrest that person for working "...in the United States as agents of the government of Iraq without notification to the Attorney General?" (edit that quote is the direct charge against her lifted straight from the first or second page of the document you linked) I mean... Iraq was not a friendly nation, was it? You could surely then argue that because she was giving them an option of better economy or gruesome warfare and a surrendering their own nation, she could realistically be charged with working to improve their economy in some capacity. Is that treasonous? Any reason why she wasn't put to death for treason but held through the meat of the Iraqi conflict and released two weeks before Bush left office? You think it was her personal duty to keep every one of her activities (maybe a handful of conversations in this case) in front of the US Attorney General's face? You think she had his cell phone number? The handler is responsible for reporting ground movements and improvements.

       Susan Lindauer gives a talk. Very incredible stuff.
