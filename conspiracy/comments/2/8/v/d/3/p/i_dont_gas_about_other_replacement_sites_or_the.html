       If you are able to expose their comments for the manipulative rhetoric that they are, then make that your one and only comment to their weak psychological ploys to deny the whole conspiracy, whatever it is ( like chemtrails ) in one comment.

       Do it in a manner which allows other people to learn exactly how it works so that they may better defend themselves from propagandists lies.

       It's that the content of the subreddit can be easily, discreetly manipulated now. Don't like 9/11 Truth discussions? Now you can cap the karma on 9/11 comments wherever you want with a few sockpuppet accounts and even the mods will be unaware. Maybe you let some things through, racist posts, things that make the sub look bad.

        /u/streetyouth

       would continually post police abuse stories always tinged with some form of "why aren't you getting mad and riled up about this?" line or the two days in a row posts about people having structures which are code violations, which is NOT a conspiracy, it's a law issue, don't like it? Change the law, that's how law works, it's not a conspiracy, neither is the fact that the police are corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police being corrupt in and of itself is not a conspiracy, as they are all human beings, and everybody knows that every human needs other humans keeping oversight on them so that they don't overstep their bounds in any harmful manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       CARE about this blatant content manipulation strategy which is a massive attack on our sub on multiple fronts, not only on our front page and comment section, but in our willingness to even stay on Reddit at all, thus cleansing their gentrified front page of those "pesky conspiracy theorists".

       I think Reddit, its self, has some limitations that will continue to hinder our ability to keep this sub reasonable in the long run. I think mostly we have hit critical mass, as we approach a quarter million subscribers and these limitation imposed by Reddit's design are starting to become noticeable. I don't currently think there is any better platform, so I'm not suggesting jumping ship, but that we may have hit critical mass and be in an inescapable tail spin. If this is the case, breaking off into multiple alternative subreddits may be the only attainable solution, even if we kept this one and just accepted it is the swamped and manipulated poor quality landing sub.

       Rougly 211 million people according to

        these stats
       </a>
       have access to internet at home as of May 2013, it's roughly 70% of the 2013 US population.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're telling me that less that one two hundredth of the population of America using
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       on Reddit is our user base reaching critical mass?
      </p>
      <p>
       As if.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take into account how stupid my stats are because Reddit is a global website.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that we've reached critical mass, it's that they're intensifying their efforts as they're attempting to further their NWO plans, and we're currently standing massively in their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       We always have, but we haven't always been able to congregate in one place on a world wide website which enables us to engage in real time political activism through social networking.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have entered the times where technology is rapidly increasing the intensity of life as far as sensory overload goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They realize this, and are using this principal against us, as they always have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not just their efforts to stop us here on Reddit, but the constant barrage of brainwashing they bathe the masses almost every single moment of their day.

       This makes us an open target for manipulation and diluting. Nothing real can be accomplished when it is flooded with garbage.

       I think we need this sub as a landing sub. We need people to hunker down and try to keep it as reasonable as possible. I think it will be a losing battle. I think while trying to maintain this, we should break off sub-conspiracy subreddits to further break
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       into smaller parts. These would ideally be broke into logical groups and listed on the side bar. Possibly a tagging system, like
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       has implemented, would help for a little while as a secondary strategy.

       Not a bad idea. I tend to remove such content, trolling and what not, immediately upon discovery. It would certainly help if more users report would said content rather than having to hunt it down or happen upon it incidentally.

       That would be up to the other mods and community to decide as a whole. As for me, I'm generally neutral on the topic. It may be helpful in keeping up with reported content on the days we may fall a bit behind, though that generally doesn't happen very often. The overall lack of trolls reported and sporadic brigading appears to be more problematic at this point.

       How about a browser plugin to offload all voting?  Whip something up, take the responsibility for this out of reddit's untrustworthy hands.

       The solution is to make
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       a private sub, and to apply some criteria to users before they can post.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would stop the shilling, brigading and the drive-by trolling that reduces so many threads to just "noise". It would also make it harder for multiple accounts and for a banned user to rejoin the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a new idea, obviously. I have proposed making the sub private many times, but the mods aren't interested, or those that are don't have the clout to make it happen.

       I agree. A panel (or the mods) looks at a user's comment history and makes an (admittedly subjective) appraisal of whether that person has made an interesting contribution, has some insight, whether they have some level of awakening etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some conspiracies that I very firmly believe that many others don't (eg Sandy Hook, Boston bombings). By the same token there are some conspiracies which are of no interest to me whatsoever (eg chemtrails). We have to accept there will be differences of opinion. This is fine, and to be expected. What we don't want, and could be excluded, are droids who flatly deny conspiracies exist, complete ignoramuses, and users who appear to working from some sort of disinfo agenda.

       Not so much. Conspiracy theorists can be wrong, even deluded, but it's not because they are braindead (ie passive non-thinkers who accept what they are told by the MSM or the government). If conspiracy theorists have an achilles heel, it is thinking too much or pursuing an idea too far.

       No...there are just a lot who accept what Alex Jones/InfoWars/RT/North Korea/NaturalNews/WND say without question. You shouldn't make generalizations like that when you can easily turn it around on the group you're defending. That's just good advice for anyone.

       It's not thinking too much, it's "overthinking". And "pursuing an idea too far" is a sign of insanity as often as it is of boldness or bravery.

       It's that the content of the subreddit can be easily, discreetly manipulated now. Don't like 9/11 Truth discussions? Now you can cap the karma on 9/11 comments wherever you want with a few sockpuppet accounts and even the mods will be unaware. Maybe you let some things through, racist posts, things that make the sub look bad.

       would continually post police abuse stories always tinged with some form of "why aren't you getting mad and riled up about this?" line or the two days in a row posts about people having structures which are code violations, which is NOT a conspiracy, it's a law issue, don't like it? Change the law, that's how law works, it's not a conspiracy, neither is the fact that the police are corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police being corrupt in and of itself is not a conspiracy, as they are all human beings, and everybody knows that every human needs other humans keeping oversight on them so that they don't overstep their bounds in any harmful manner.
      </p>

       CARE about this blatant content manipulation strategy which is a massive attack on our sub on multiple fronts, not only on our front page and comment section, but in our willingness to even stay on Reddit at all, thus cleansing their gentrified front page of those "pesky conspiracy theorists".
