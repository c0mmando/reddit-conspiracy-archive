       Hello everyone I know its be about a month since I last posted on the
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/250yf1/2016_presidential_elections_what_if_an/">
        Fake 2016 Election
       </a>
       idea., have been busy with work and revising the idea based on all the input from reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The revisions I made I have turned into a movement Called the
       <a href="http://goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths">
        Formation of the Commonwealths.
       </a>
       This is something that naturally came into existence after I thought about what will happen when people start realizing there is a better way to contribute to a better country.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is that at some point after we have ironed out some of our major problems with our current U.S  financial crisis, and government corruption that we start moving toward a new or if you look at our history old Commonwealths joined together in small groups for each others benefit with no central government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commonwealth Idea and the Fake 2016 Political Election System operates on three basic foundations:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths#reform-problem">
          Henry Thoreau subscribed to philosophy of transcendentalism.
         </a>
         It emphasizes idealism rather than materialism; that is, it views the world as an expression of spirit and every individual as an expression of a common humanity. To be human is to be born with moral imperatives that are not learned from experience but which are discovered through introspection. Therefore, everyone must be free to act according to his conscience in order to find the truth buried within.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better-place/forming-new-commonwealth-states/sources-inspiration/new-party">
          Game Mechanics
         </a>
         The New Party is an effort to construct a new approach to the political process that is fully appropriate to the information age. Rather than attempt to pose “another party”over and against the existing established parties, our intent is to create a platform that sits above the existing political process (“overcodes” it) and is able to take full advantage of the capabilities that are afforded by “Web 3.0”. We consider this approach to be strategically similar to the transformation of politics that was brought about by the last major shift in media – television. In a very fundamental sense, “the medium is the politics”.

         <a href="http://goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better-place/forming-new-commonwealths/sources-inspiration/revolution-instruction-manual">
          Revolution: An Instruction Manual
         </a>
         A group six Indian tribes all with their own cultures and traditions called the Iroquois that formed a Federation that lasted well before Columbus and up until 1779 when they were conquered militarily by the U.S. Many historians believe that the the Iroquois Federation was the inspiration for the United States, the difference being the Federation never had a central government.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I just wanted to thank everyone who contributed to this idea and now what we have here is one last revision to run by everyone to get further input for the final changes before we start asking everyone for nominations to form the Committee for Political Change. So please take some time and read carfully everything I took from the community and put into making this. Im sure I still missed a few things and so I will need your help in clarifying what we still need to move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       To recap, the idea was:
      </p>
      <h2>
       <a href="http://goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better-place/forming-new-commonwealths/commonwealth-objectives/creating-fake-2016-online-presidential-election">
        Creating a Fake 2016 Online Presidential Election
       </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
       The idea is to show how much of a mockery the election system really is by creating our own 2016 presidential election that happens on the web. A 2016 Presidential Election website will be created allowing anyone to nominate a person with a well established P.A.T.S. history (Participatory, Accountable, Trustworthy, Skillful) as the president of the United States. The person nominating will have his or her own P.A.T.S. history, along with everyone else who will be contributing to that persons candidacy by assigning a reputation score to each deed that person did in his life history that is publicly available. The magic happens when people start building their own reputations by contributing to the site by informing others though comments or new information to support claims people make on the site itself.To prevent self-importance from infecting a nomination its better if people nominate others that might do the job well as that action comes from a place of contribution. The nominee logs into the website and makes it know whether he or she will accept or reject that nomination. If accepted the nominee submits their own campaign dossier, outlining whats wrong with the country and what they would do to improve the lives of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I don't actually think the idea of of having a president and voting on one for what we call the country is a good idea since we have learned that the United States is a corporation with the president acting in a rulership position. The current problem with government is that it acts as if we are all subjects to this rule from whoever has the most power in government. I think it would be much better without a federal government, or one that is in the hands of the people with elected leaders of small groups of Commonwealth's making decisions on a local level with many leaders. Its my belief that small distributed groups of people can help our society prosper over any top down governing body simply because its closer directly to individuals, and the feedback loop is two way, instead of one way. In any communication system you run into serious problems with one way communication. It works the same in human interactions as well. With Commonwealth groups working together in a  two-way style of operation Leaders and People that run the Commonwealth exchange ideas for the betterment of all.  In one-way governing, people at the top make the policies and those policies trickle down to the people. Policy becomes well established before anyone really has a chance to exchange ideas about it. Their are some exceptions to this but any exceptions just adds to the illusionary nature of having a say. Having a say doesn't really effect the status quo as we all know by now with the rampant corruption in government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know many people believe that society runs better without idealism and I will disagree by pointing out that in the arena of science it works great, but in the area of human interactions the only thing materialism has given us is the all this nice stuff that creates the illusion of a well run society. Behind the scenes we know better. We are not better off at all, and in fact society is becoming more disconnected from what makes us human the more we delve into our selfish nature. We need balance. Materialism has its place, but not in human to human interactions. This doesn't mean giving up your self at the expense of another, it just simple means that,  all things being equal we work better when we are helping each other live better lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can temporarily use the flawed system to draw attention away from the real elections by getting people involved in actually making them feel like they are participating in something that they can contribute to. Where in the real election choice is limited to binary decisions which just makes people feel like they don't have choice. If people suddenly stopped paying attention to the real elections and instead started focusing on fake elections where they felt like it was more directed toward what the people want, it might start sparking dialog about the nature of our current social/political system and convince people to start looking for other solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once I get feedback on this the plan moving forward is to create a new post in a couple of weeks with final changes asking redditors to nominate people to create the Committee on Political Change. The nominees who accept the role in the Committee will start the process of nominating people for the roles to create the Commonwealth for the Fake Elections and start the website.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will be needing people who:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        People who have posts on Reddit that bring awareness and empowerment.
       </li>
       <li>
        People that have comments that attempt to inform instead of derail.
       </li>
       <li>
        People that have accounts that are older than 3 months from the date of this post and have a post/comment history described above.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Let me know what you all think.

       I love the idea...I'm just gonna propose an issue or two that might come up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there maybe too many candidates, and it will take too much time for the individual to understand the opinions on policy issues of each. This will not encourage participation.
      </p>
      <p>
       One solution might be to localize the 'elections'. This would result in an Iroquois Federation of Tribes based on locality. Starting out as a 'Presidential' election might be too big of a scope...when it isn't even the goal of this initiative, which is to set up an Iroquois Federation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the idea of not having a self-nomination, but why not take that a step further. Take the candidate out of the role of self-promotion altogether. Prevent the egoist from building his brand out of self interest. In any process where popularity is more important than content the narcissist will excel.

       Well we are using the presidential election as a stepping stone to get people used to politics involved in the process of using the new ethical and online mechanics model. It basically will run along side it generating interest but showing people how a humane system works.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think once we get enough support for the Commonwealth we can start local nominations for each common, but thats way off, we cant start making changes like that off the bat I dont think, people will resist it. Its my idea that things should be slow and gradual. Just like what happened to our country with materialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I think you are right about taking the candidate out of the role of self-promotion.

       how exactly do you plan on using game theory?  it has been used extensively already in politics heavily... i mean there is nothing new you could bring there i don't think...
      </p>
      <p>
       it has also been heavily applied to civics and civil service to disasterous reuslt (VA scandals, banking crisis(fuck you greenspan).)
      </p>
      <p>
       i feel like you just threw that term in there for some "PIZZAZ" or something, and don't actually understand what game theory is, or don't actually know/understand how to use it in your model.

       I appreciate your sentiment. And this is how grass roots communities form change. Thank you for your links. I will study them more in depth tomorrow. I like the idea you are presenting as it is much needed change. However on a lighter and funny note, the first thing that popped up in my mind while reading this was the campaign of Vermin Supreme who genuinely ran for many things such as
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin_Supreme">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin_Supreme
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But the best video of Vermin Supreme is his presidential campaign where he ran as a democratic candidate in 2012. Much satire and quite reddit worthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://youtu.be/4d_FvgQ1csE">
        http://youtu.be/4d_FvgQ1csE
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking about this as I am about to post it. I am not trying to take away from your message. I see a correlation between the two. Sometimes satire can bring new awareness. I appreciate abstract art. And Vermin is a prime example .
