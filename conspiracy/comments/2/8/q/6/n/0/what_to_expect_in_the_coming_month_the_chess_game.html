       The immigrants interviewed believe there is a new law allowing them in. The ex border control say this surge is completely orchestrated.

       ICE has been caught shipping plane loads of illegals all around the US. Spreading them out.

       New York is leading the charge to allow the illegals to vote and receive tax payer funded assistance

      <p>
       Besides the possibility that they are just shipping in voters for the 2016 election. This completely plays in to the Cloward-Piven steategy, which requires overloading the welfare system to bring in communism.

       Also people are waking up to their fraud and the dollar is going down the shitter quickly because it is being dumped as a reserve currency because everyone knows the recovery is a lie. So this is a point where a new threat and a new war is needed as a distraction. The US news has been hiding the fact that a bunch of radioactive material was stolen from Mexico city with no other possible purpose than being used for a dirty bomb
       <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/06/12/radioactive-material-stolen-from-lab-in-mexico/">

       It is already know that the ISIS group in Iraq has said they will attack the US and New York was mentioned. And it is already known that the US trained and controls ISIS
       <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2014/06/officials-u-s-trained-isis-at-secret-base-in-jordan/">
        http://www.wnd.com/2014/06/officials-u-s-trained-isis-at-secret-base-in-jordan/
       </a>
       And that ISIS members have US passports
       <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27844749">
        http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27844749
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       With the border wide open, the dirty bomb will be set off in the US and blamed on ISIS. They will use the talking points that America is full of terrorist and from there they will work on forcing gun confiscation for everyone's safety and militarized the streets of America for everyone's safety, and lock up/disappear political dissent by acting as if they were linked to the terrorists... Kinda of 1984 style from there.

       So it was just a distraction with the tangential benefit of bulwarking the apparent effectiveness of the Homeland Security/ domestic standing army, and validating the recently revived Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee. Starting to sound awfully McCarthian.

       Let's say that number doubles over the next month or so, so that's about 200,000 kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if our government would decide that these kids need their parents to come here to take care of them. Add 2 parents for each kid, now we're up to 600,000 immigrants. Maybe they have other family members that come along as well, say maybe an additional one per kid, that would bring it up to 800,000.

       The US can't keep absorbing immigrants who don't speak English and don't fit into American culture. It will
       <em>
        destroy
       </em>
       the culture. It's inevitable.

       Seems to be the plan. Divide and conquer... could we BE any more divided? Let's find out. But don't be surprised when they conquer us. We're already conquered.

       "Why is nobody doing anything about this?"

       I've been asking the same question since 2001 on a variety of topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only answer I can conceive is because the people in charge want to precipitate chaos, rioting and poverty. Otherwise, they would
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       something. This contrived influx of illegals (Democrat voters) is a case in point. It could be stopped within one hour, if anyone with authority were interested in stopping it.

       My thoughts exactly. It should also be noted that many consider the influx as a way of boosting the GDP artificially, though I have no idea how they conclude this.

       They're trying to bring the economy down and really ramp up government spending by weighing down the economy with ever more welfare spending.

       I agree with the sentiment of your post overall...but don't ever rely on making predictions based on what the mainstream media says. If "they" wanted to make a dirty bomb they could easily do it no need to steal anything and risk an actual story over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only possible reason for this story is so that there is a back story and "evidence" for when the "terrorists" attack.

       If a terrorist act of that mangitude happens then all that NSA spying should be deemed useless and the entire domestic spying apparatus should be fully shut down along with the TSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government should return the trillions of tax dollars back to the citizens and apologize for their failure if there ever is another terrorist attack on US soil.
