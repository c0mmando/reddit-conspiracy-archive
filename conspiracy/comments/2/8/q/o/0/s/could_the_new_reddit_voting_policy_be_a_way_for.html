<p>Text: Oh no, I&#39;m sure they have (what they [want to] believe to be) a legitimate reason for it: money. Think about it: who does this change benefit? People who want to manipulate votes without getting caught. Well who wants to do that? That would be people trying to people trying to get something seen by more people. Advertisers do literally only that.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the idea floating around that it has to do with AMAs: big-name celebrities were getting scared off by downvotes. Rereading the announcement, it makes a lot of sense with that context.</p>

<p>Either they were paid to implement this change, or, more likely, they just hope it will make the site become more attractive to advertisers/celebrities. I think success has gone to their heads and they think reddit is to big to fail. It&#39;s not, and while this change won&#39;t be the ultimate death of reddit as some have hyperbolized, it has greatly shaken our faith in the administration. The way they&#39;ve handled it is shady at worst and idiotic at best, depending on how conspiratorial you&#39;re feeling.</p>

<p>They claim it&#39;s about preventing automated voting bots, but it really only makes it easier for them to hide.</p>

<p>I hate to sound like a conspiracy theorist, and I don&#39;t want to latch on to this idea too hard just yet, but it&#39;s the only explanation that makes sense to me right now. Feel free to come prove me wrong though admins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they aren&#39;t. The comments no show &quot;?&quot;s instead of your score. This was useful in situations where someone asked for advice in the field of math/science/medicine/etc. and you could tell their opinion. Now you might be inclined to trust &quot;5 points&quot; where before you could see &quot;187 upvotes, 182 downvoted&quot; which indicated that the person was sharing a controversial or incorrect. </p>
