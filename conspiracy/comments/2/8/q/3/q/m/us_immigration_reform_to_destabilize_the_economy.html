       My friend was telling me this last night, because I had no idea about the thousands of kids coming into the U.S. illegally through Mexico. He said that the Obama administration is allowing illegal immigrants into the country to further destabilize the economy, increase crime, and make it easier to enact sweeping control-based legislation. I haven't been keeping up with the news very much, so this kind of blew my mind, but it makes sense based on what we've been seeing. Opinions?

       This is verifiable. Obama recently shut down security operations of a large portion of border by declaring it a "national park" conveniently just in time to see all these minors do this completely unprecedented "migration" in to America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economic experts have warned of a potential plan to destabilize our economy by flooding the country with illegal aliens, now we see it happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny enough, somebody posted here yesterday that DHS had a contract up for bids back in January 2014 to "cater" and or accommodate a large group of immigrant youths. Seems someone knew about this surprise migration ahead of time and wanted to help it go smoothly. (Can you say
       <em>
        high treason
       </em>
       ?)
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, what I think we might see happen is some sort of story about how all these kids now have nobody to take care of them, so we had better bring their parents and the rest of their families over here, and make them all citizens as well. None of them will be employed seeing as how they just recently moved over here, so we'll have potentially over a million new welfare recipients that neither the state run welfare system or the economy as a whole is capable of supporting.

       China had the right idea. The thing is is that the writing is on the wall.that this Obama administration has kief countless times. And everyone cries that he was "cleaning hushs mess". Well hes been in office for 6.5 years. You.can't blame everything on the previous administration like Nancy pelosi does

       The wave of illegal immigration encouraged by Obama is not just designed to destabilize the economy, although that is a secondary function. It's primary purpose is to destroy the culture, and to split American society. This is endgame stuff, folks. Obama and the people who own him are intent on taking power away from white America. They don't care if they have to destroy the United States to do it.

       It is important to distinguish what part of the economy we are talking about.  Both parties have acted to destabilize America's labor force for decades.  This helps corporations and thus helps the on paper economy the MSM obsesses over.

       New York is leading the charge to allow the illegals to vote and receive tax payer funded assistance

       Besides the possibility that they are just shipping in voters for the 2016 election.  This completely plays in to the Cloward-Piven steategy, which requires overloading the welfare system to bring in communism.

       Also people are waking up to their fraud and the dollar is going down the shitter quickly because it is being dumped as a reserve currency because everyone knows the recovery is a lie. So this  is a point where a new threat and a new war is needed as a distraction. The US news has been hiding the fact that a bunch of radioactive material was stolen from Mexico city with no other possible purpose than being used for a dirty bomb

       It is already know that the ISIS group in Iraq has said they will attack the US and New York was mentioned. And it is already known that the US trained and controls ISIS

      <p>
       With the border wide open, the dirty bomb will be set off in the US and blamed on ISIS. They will use the talking points that America is full of terrorist and from there they will work on forcing gun confiscation for everyone's safety and militarized the streets of America for everyone's safety, and lock up/disappear political dissent by acting as if they were linked to the terrorists... Kinda of 1984 style from there.

       Yes of course. Our job market will be diluted. Also Obama can create 11 million new democrats with the stroke of a pen. I hate what's been going on. It seems our president cares more about everyone else then his own people. Using tax payer money to help illegal citizens and not how own people? Fucking sickening

       Although I wouldn't mind this idea. We split the country in half and everyone who wants to live in a free society can love in the west and anyone who wants a government controlled dictator many state can stay on the east

       I think this is more about offering citizenship to anyone who will fight in the next war. American soldiers are waking up to the bullshit.

       Increases in undocumented immigrants[1] won't destabilize an economy that depends on low-wage disposable labor dynamics. In an ideal world, you would be outrageous not because they are coming from places impoverished due in large part to US foreign policies (past and current), but because they will not be offered social services, and if they are, they will be shamed and scared into not taking advantage of them.

       (a) Illegal. Traveling is a human right, even if that right is arbitrarily curtailed in article 13 of The Universal Declaration of human Rights because of the unquestioned belief in the "(nation-)state". As such, traveling without proper nation-state documentation or permission should not be considered illegal. Compare that to stealing or corruption, which are and ought to be called illegal, without dispersing their social stigma onto undocumented people.

       (b) Alien. They are not from Mars and they are not radically different non-human non-animal beings. They are "persons" and are afforded the same rights that "persons" under the law are afforded; attempts to depict a different universe (in order to make you forget that fact) than that is unjust. They are from about one step left to an arbitrarily drawn border of deemed-to-be intolerable difference.

       try being an 'illegal alien' in Mexico. Beating, rape, imprisonment, extortion--that's the way they handle it. To say they 'won't be offered social services' is hilarious--we already have millions dependent on Uncle Sucker. This latest wave is designed to tug at people's heartstrings--"aw, the cute lil girls!". 0bama wants to ensure more devoted lifetime Demorat voters for Michelle and the girls, when they run for office, which they will.
