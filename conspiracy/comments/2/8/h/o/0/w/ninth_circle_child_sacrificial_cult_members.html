      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The International Common Law Court’s case against Pope Francis and others revealed today the identity of members of the Ninth Circle child sacrificial cult, as well as the location and dates of their murderous rituals. In response, a call for Special Deputies to stop the Ninth Circle and arrest its members has been issued by the Prosecutor’s Office of the Court.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The same evidence also positively identifies when and where some of the Ninth Circle rituals are being conducted, involving the routine rape, torture and murder of children and newborn babies.
“
        <strong>
         Senior Ninth Circle members include Jorge Bergoglio and Joseph Ratzinger, so-called popes of the Church of Rome, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, two British High Court judges, at least one Catholic bishop in Canada, senior government ministers in Belgium and England, and members of the British, Dutch and Belgian royal families”
        </strong>
        stated a news release from the Prosecutor’s Office today.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The most recent gatherings of the Ninth Circle occurred in the crypt of Caernarfon Castle in Wales, and within a subterranean vault beneath Marie-Reine-du-Monde Roman Catholic cathedral in Montreal, Canada. At least two of the primary defendants were identified at these recent gatherings, where children under five years of age were ritually killed. The next major conclave of the Ninth Circle at the Montreal cathedral, at 1085 Rue de la Cathédrale, is scheduled for August 15, 2014.”
In response to this startling evidence, the five Court judges adjourned the trial proceedings today to allow the Prosecutor’s Office to issue a call for special deputies to take immediate action to stop the murderous rituals of the Ninth Circle.

       There are many victims and eyewitnesses, along with the major pedophilia scandals befalling the Vatican a few years ago, that led to the first resignation of a pope in
       <strong>
        600

       years.

       Snopes is a disinfo front passing as a debunker.  It's bullshit, and if you go way way back into my comment history you'll find in-depth debunking of them.  They're called control opposition, whereby corporate interests setup an "activist" group to portray as the opposition against corporate interests, but their grievances are always superficial, diversionary from the real problems and never lead to anything.  It debunks common myths and obvious ones while diverting and covering for the serious and very sophisticated crimes.

       Did you even read rational wiki?  It is anything but rational, unbiased professionalism. It's tone is that of some ranting pretentious Gawker narcissist.

       "and is actually good enough at this to have fooled a few normal people (and a lot of raving conspiracy-prone nutters)."  Sure, that's professional and mature.

       Look up their pink slime, or that pink slime meat, "debunking."  If you can't debunk it yourself than you're an idiot not worth my time, and all I can say is go find a fucking good university that'll rigorously teach you critical thought and skeptical analysis,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       against those presuming to be the "watchers."  When you write 10-15 pages a night, on average, while reading through hundreds of information, you'll look back at your current mediocre cognitive level and face-palm.

       Delete this post you idiot.  Post the youtube video interviewing people, that's great, but this ITCCS shit is such bullshit it discredits very scary and legitimate claims of evil.  What the fuck are you thinking?  Do you have
       <em>
        any

       idea how fucking irresponsible you are for posting this shit?

       Well it's a pretty huge story, as is! Child rape/torture/murder, Pope and previous Popes high court judges, British/Dutch/Belgian royal families, senior government officials implicated, bodies

       , at least 4 eyewitnesses...

       The source is a guy either using a very real topic and the victims for "donations," or he's just a delusional vigilante.  At least the topic is getting more exposure... Guess we'd have to find out what he continues to do...

       How about you just post the video, and then note how the guy behind the blog might be misguided or dumb, or exploiting a very real issue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the case or reasoning behind it, or lack thereof, at least the videos are gaining some attention.

       The topic is not, but the linked blog is poor judgement and superfluous.  This is still fascinating.  I constantly see you personally, 4to4, so impulsively and stupidly dismissing entire time and again proven conspiracies and crimes due to one bad post, one straw man...  You need to learn how to thinking critically and elaborate, or if you're not going to don't fucking comment.

       Has your short attention span already forgotten the entire Vatican sex scandal a few years ago that led to the first pope resignation in
       <strong>
        600
       </strong>
       years?  Do you have no attention span or memory?

       I have some questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) What is the evidence, and where is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) How does the author know where one of the recent gatherings was?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Why isn't this posted on
       <a href="/r/Christianity">
        /r/Christianity
       </a>
       ? Catholics deserve to know the truth, if it's truth.
