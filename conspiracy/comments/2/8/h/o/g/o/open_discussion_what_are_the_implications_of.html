        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Technology is making transparency in patient health easier with the promise of better diagnostic care and significant cost reduction. While the benefits of this transparency have been well documented, the privacy pitfall inherent in this system, does not seem to have been well considered . </p>

<p>In the past, a patient would divulge sensitive information(illicit drugs/steroids, sexual partners, STD&#39;s, abortion, depression, mental illness) to their physician with confidence that the medical record would be created for purposes of treatment and maintained locally. This record would only be dissemination when the recipient had a medical need to know and consent has been provided by the patient. </p>

<p>Today this information is captured in a realm that is much more public, disseminated more freely, and is not protected with the same vigor. Once sensitive information is out there- It&#39;s out there forever!</p>

<p>The Privacy implications of this seem HUGE. However, I have not seem much discussion on this topic. </p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised that more consideration has not been given to the implications of this system, particularly for those with prejudicial diagnosis such as mental illness. Quite frankly, I&#39;m even more baffled when I consider the great concern that American public has taken toward privacy as it relates to the NSA, Facebook, and Twitter. Why would one care more about privacy of their email then they do about their personal history.</p>

<p>In the past, going to the doctor to discuss a sensitive issue, seemed like good wisdom. Today, in light of the fact that details of my visit would be captured in a living record , where it will be accessed, administered  or sold without my direction makes the same decision feelâ€¦.. reckless .</p>

<p>What am I missing ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So a good reason not to be open with your doctor. Something to remember.</p>

<p>You can blame this on Nixon and Bush. The Nixon administration wanted Daniel Ellsberg&#39;s medical and psychiatric records to use against him but legally they couldn&#39;t get them so burglarized his doctor. So now your medical records can easily be accessed by the government without even a warrant. So when you talk to your doctor remember you&#39;re talking to the police, the FBI, CIA, NSA. They are your enemy. Remember.</p>

<p>To be clear, I do personally watch what I reveal when I am at the doctor. Its not that I don&#39;t trust him personally, I just have to consider if I want my question or ailment captured in a record that will be with me for the rest of my life..... do you disagree?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see a day coming soon where the sheriff comes to my door and removes the guns from my house because I suffer from chronic major depression even though I have never threatened or used a gun to harm another living thing.  </p>

<p>&quot;Studies have shown that depressed people who own guns are more likely to use them against themselves or others, so just to be safe, citizen, we are taking yours away.&quot;</p>

<p>I like guns.  I like to shoot things.  <em>Things</em>.  Bullseyes, pumpkins and watermelons, cans, targets that look like zombies.  I&#39;m good at it and it makes me proud to do something well.  And I believe as a law abiding citizen I am allowed to own guns, small and large, so long as I don&#39;t harm anyone with them.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the last time I went to the dr. they asked me did I own guns before writing a prescription.  Without thinking, I answered &quot;yes.&quot;  In hindsight, that may have been a mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your concerns. Your doctor may have asked you about guns, but did he capture that in your record? Sometimes they don&#39;t... You should look at your record. Of course if you are seeing a doctor for a mental illness that comes with a lot of privacy risks in an of itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bring up an excellent point; the discussion around this topic is pertinent to the future of medical privacy--both in the US and the industrialized world at large. </p>

<p>I had a first-hand experience with the violation of own medical privacy about seven years ago. I had long been under the assumption that what was discussed between patient and doctor was privileged, and extremely private, information, and I had typically been very forthright with my doctors. I began to see a chiropractor after having issues of tingling in the middle two fingers on my left hand. I had recently begun a job which required strain on my wrists and forearms, and I wanted to square away the issue before it became worse. </p>

<p>I told the chiropractor that I occasionally smoked marijuana, thinking nothing of it.</p>

<p>A year after my chiropractic visit, my first daughter&#39;s mother and I split up and began a custody battle. Without getting into the lengthy and overly personal situation, she had my medical records (amongst every other record surrounding my life) subpoenaed and the evidence that I had occasionally smoked marijuana was used to paint a vilified picture of me--leading to a complete loss of custody over my daughter to a woman with undocumented and intense depression and self harm issues, amongst others.</p>

<p>The point of the story here is that my full disclosure to my doctor--made in alleged privacy--was completely used against me; while the unspoken and undocumented mental issues of my previous partner completely bypassed the judicial radar.</p>

<p>Is it good to be honest with your physician? Possibly; but be wary of what you reveal. Your information is completely available for anyone to see at all times, and might be used against you when you are at your weakest and most vulnerable moments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sorry to hear that man. It sucks that marijuana is so vilified, despite its repeatedly proven safety when compared to <strong><em>legal</em></strong> drugs like alcohol and tobacco. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, man. It felt like complete bullshit when it happened. The state in which I live (and in which the custody proceedings went down) now happens to be a state where Cannabis is recreationally legal, so there is also some bitterness in that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The data hub. I have recently needed a cat scan for a suspected hernia, but havent been to the doctors in years. But, as i checked in for my appt, the receptionist only needed my name and social sec. # and bam, she had all my info from all my previous doctors. </p>

<p>Positive side: it was beneficial and made checking in easier, instead of waiting a half hour i only waited twenty five minutes. </p>

<p>Negative side: it is possible that some uncredentialed person (a receptionist for christs sake) to get all of my information at the touch of the button. </p>

<p>The issue i have with this, is within obamacare, right there in words within the official legislation, it says that the information within the datahub will/can be disseminated amongst various government agencies, private and publics medical officials and practices, as well as third party corporations and businesses that have nothing to do with why im being seen, all without my consent. And, if facebook has taught us anything, it is that information about people (the more the better), is a very, very profitable proprietary asset. And you can bet your house Big Pharma is capitalizing on this BIG TIME.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the concern is more around the confidentiality of data rather than security of data. Here are a couple of case illustrations. </p>

<p>-11/28/2013 - A woman was held at the Canadian border because an EMR accessed by border agents indicated that she had depression</p>

<p>6/12/2002 - Mental Health Professionals place psychotherapy notes and details regarding past criminal activities directly in patients EMR&#39;s</p>

<p>There is also some concern that individuals applying for jobs and insurance typically are required to authorize disclosure of their entire health record. (<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/admnsimp/nprm/pvc17.htmL">http://aspe.hhs.gov/admnsimp/nprm/pvc17.htmL</a>)</p>

<p>Given that there are around 25MM such disclosures per year, the concern is broad and the potential for embarrassment, stigma and discrimination is high</p>
