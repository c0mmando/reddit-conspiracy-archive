       Government's biggest job is to convince you that you need them.

       I feel like more and more we don't. The information age is in it's infancy and it's already shutting down the entertainment industry as we know it.

       Bitcoin may destroy banking one day.

       Why does government think it's safe? i feel like most of the law system has just been recently replaced by cheap video cameras.

       As someone who hasn't watched television PROGRAMMING in 5 yrs, this pleases me. I want to drink all the celebrity's tears when America finally wakes up and realizes these retards are insignificant.

       No, it's better than that my friend. We'll be able to reward the retards that should be rewarded...
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll be able to directly pay people that we find entertaining without a middleman agency to handle money management (and what the movie should be and on and on)

       Think of a guy like Shoenice.

       Value for value, you pay the movie/actor what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe at the end of movie credits there's a bitcoin address and QR code with each person's name as well as a general code for the whole movie that could be split off to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       You watch a movie, so you chuck them 25 cents, a dollar, 10 bucks? Directly to the movie at the end and maybe there's an actor in it or you loved the effects, you could tip that guy directly as well. It'd almost be like.... justice....

       How did you know I watch shoenice?-- BTW he's getting getting the shaft by YT. with 2 million views on a lot of his videos, that basically means he's making a decent living on YT. and he keeps getting the ban hammer. and I don't know if you saw the thread on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       a few weeks back, about Google execs banning smaller YT channels to cut back on AdSense checks going out, but I suspect that's what's happening here. because he's had the same channel for years, and now all of the sudden he's day to day. and when you get banned, all your old videos and Adsense money attached to them,go bye bye.

       Bitcoin is not going to destroy any banks and is most likely started by those you loathe.  Just look at the bithash.io drama, it's a power consolidation happening before your eyes.  It is controlled opposition just like all forms of social dispute.

       I don't know about that, they already have a good thing going. When you have all the money in monopoly you don't all of a sudden go 'hey, lets switch out the type of money we're using! One that's not in our direct control like the one we got is"

       There are some real challenges for bitcoin, if it plans on staying de-centralized.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found
       <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/9402/mining-pool-centralization-crisis-levels/">
        a decent article
       </a>
       on the centralization of mining.
      </p>
      <p>
       (
       <strong>
        I do not personally endorse any crytpocurreny, pool or coin-related site.
       </strong>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think Bitcoin in the step in the right direction, however I don't think it's a complete solution. The peer 2 peer nature of it certainly has it's drawbacks. I am confident further innovation could lead to an even better coin that has de-centralization in mind for the long term.

       That is their biggest weakness. It's like a myth, if no one believes it, all power is taken from it. While they may have billions, we have something they lack: everyday skills. They believe their money makes them better but it just cushions them from reality. They have servants to do everything for them but I doubt they can take care of themselves as we can.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we ignore them, especially celebrities, they lose power. We just need to make sure the power of government remains ours, once and forever. If they want to appear on TV for drug use and rehab, fine, but we should stop giving them attention unless they do something useful like a major discovery, cure, etc.

       Government means nothing but MIND Control.

       We each have a mind (imagination) of our own.

       Why let government (fear of authority) be a figment of your imagination? 
Where did they get us to? Are we any more advanced than we should be as a collective? We've been duped. If you really think about it though, they played that trick on us very well. Slimey schmucks.

       as nice a thought as this is, truth is we do need them. The truth is though that government is not suppose to be "them", it's suppose to be "us". When government becomes a "them" it is no longer a democratic government but a monarchy. When the government is made of "us" for "us" then it's not a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that we are being ruled over by people who really don't care about us at all (much less view themselves as one of us). To them we are nothing more than sources of revenue and worker bees generating wealth for the 1%.

       unfortunately there is no solution. It's kind of like diagnosing stage 4 cancer.... it's nice to know what's killing you but it's too late to do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crux of the problem is money. The economic system has been fucked beyond repair at this point. Will trillions of derivate junk debt out there, nations with trillions of national debt, with the 1% sucking up all the wealth over the past 20 years (even if you fixed everything today, it wouldn't undo all the wealth they now control).
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is no "solution", at least no good one.
      </p>
      <p>
       How will this resolve itself? Probably another decade of mass suffering followed by the death of capitalism. Governments will take over all functions of society as a means of trying to curb the suffering of the people. People will call it communism at first, but it won't really be communism... I don't know what they will call it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may actually lead to some good years for mankind when it happens, as everyone will be given a job and have a place in society. With everything centrally managed there's the possibility that a lot of problems will be able to get address (health care and what not).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also possible though that through centralization TPTB will simply enslave society.
      </p>
      <p>
       We won't know which way it goes until it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the idea that there is anything any of us can do is a bit of a dream. Even if you kicked every politician out of office and put in super good ethical people, it won't stop the economic shit storm that's going to hit (right now we're just experiencing tremors, the actual earthquake hasn't even happened).
      </p>
      <p>
       I know being a doom sayer doesn't win any points with anyone, and people garner much more hope from any solution no matter how impractical, but reality is there is no solution what has been done.

       I think we need real community leaders. Ones that bring everyone together. So that when a crisis hits, the community can take care of each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all honesty, I think being that leader is no easy task. I am still unsure about how one fosters that kind of "solidarity" or unity.

       Why not bypass them, and set up a representational government as per the constitution.  Slowly bump them out of their illegally stolen positions of authority.   Ever since the coup of Kennedy's murder, it's been all fraud and lie.

       I agree. It's why I became an anarchist. We're better than those criminals. Time to just ignore they're there. Maybe they'll go away. I don't have time for organized, tangible "revolutions" when revolution begins in the mind. I hope more people come to your conclusion.

       Supersede the Status-Quo! Each of us need to use our unique perspectives and create that which makes The Establishment obsolete. We need to secede, stop participation and nullify when necessary, that which actively creates contradiction, malinvestment and economic oppression. While you halt your monetary support of contradiction, you can build/create/use that which makes this contradiction obsolete. We need to emulate the successes of those which help to prove the Irrelevance of these criminals by doing whatever it takes.. (using alternative currencies, supporting community gardening, homeschooling, investing in alt-energy, ect). We can have Individuated Unity if we would just work on ourselves and our relationship with our local communities...
