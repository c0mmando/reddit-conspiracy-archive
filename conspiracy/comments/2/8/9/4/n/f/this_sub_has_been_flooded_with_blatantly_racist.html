       I think it goes without saying, the difference between those of the Jewish race, religion or culture and the "used to be communally understood definition" of Zionists. But no, I guess I will define that when we generally talk about TPTB, the Zionists, the elite, the Illuminati, "they", we were all discussing the small group of ultra-rich, extremely powerful, highly symbolic and ritualistic, old-old-old bloodlines, deeply shrouded in mystery folks that run the global political, corporate and banking scenes. (I'm going to depart from the pack here by saying religion, because I think many here disagree that much of the "NWO battle" has been an epic religious war, for like, 1000s of years)

       Wtf,
       <em>
        seriously, WHAT THE FUCK?!
       </em>
       has been up with the recent onslaught of low grade, blatantly racist, ignorant and inflammatory links and comments lately?! Did hundreds of regulars ditch this sub for warmer weather? Depart into all those promoted splinter-subs from the spring? Are we being brigaded by another sub? Are a handful of highly, highly misguided posters sockpuppeting the shit out of new content?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wandered into this sub, shortly after Boston. I was here during the Snowden leaks and Michael Hastings. I asked a lot of dumb questions, but there were many helpful, eloquent and valiant responses. I'm no where near an expert in this sub, but I feel like I have a firm grasp on the history, science, psychology and symbolic references that are "the norm" here. Am I alone in feeling frustration at the sudden spiral into malicious, ignorant and just plain
       <em>
        fucked
       </em>
       content, as of late? Where's the response from Moderation here? Just deleting reported content is not addressing the issue. Something has changed and it feels highly uncomfortable. I don't want to accuse this sub of being highly manipulated and shilled, but
       <em>
        she just ain't what she used to be!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What's going on, and where's my fuggin peeps at? Cuz it's been feeling pretty middle-school-locker-room in here...

       But there was no mention of who this person was. He who will not be named? Such inside discussion? The magic inside conversation gets us ridiculed as racists by conspiratard. Thanks for your insider conversation, jackasses.

       I've noticed it too. The trolling is getting a lot more coordinated. I had quite an experience today, I was targeted by several trolling groups because of some content I posted, and it was starting to make me think I was going crazy. Then I figured out what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people post garbage alongside all the legitimate content, in order to discredit the sub or the person. Then they all vote together, which makes it look like most people agree with the trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're getting much better at what they do. The worst is when they create posts that
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       legitimate, but are actually lies. "Intelligent trolling" I like to call it. I've seen a lot of that the last few weeks. It's getting really really out of control.

       I've been keeping an eye on sites which are based on user contributed content.. like Reddit, Wikipedia, YouTube and others.. Somewhere around 2010-2011 SHTF, but in the past few years things have really gotten out of control. The entire baseline, the mean, has been shifted.. I believe Wikipedia was hit the hardest and earliest.. from there it spread like wildfire all over the place. It's really quite frightening what's been happening in the past few years. The bigger Reddit gets the worst it will get. I already consider Reddit an irradiated wasteland. This is the longest I've used a single account in a while now and I've also been on Reddit for a while. Not 8 years while like you, more like 6. However, I've been on Wikipedia for over a decade and I watched as that place completely transformed from the inside out. As Hakim Bey, the great anarchist so beautifully said, "
       <em>
        So the modern Tong cannot be elitist - but there's n reason it can't be choosy. Many non-authoritarian organizations have foundered on the dubious principle of open membership, which frequently leads to preponderance of assholes, yahoos, spoilers, whining neurotics, &amp; police agents. If a Tong is organized around a special interest (especially an illegal or risky or margin interest) it certainly has the right to compose itself according to the 'affinity group" principle. If secrecy means (a) avoiding publicity &amp; (b) vetting possible members, the "secret society" can scarcely be accused o violating anarchist principles. In fact, such societies have a long &amp; honorable history in the antiauthoritarian movement, from Proudhon's dream of re-animating the Holy Vehm as a kind of "People's Justice", to Bakunin's various schemes, to Durutti's 'Wanderers.' We ought not to allow Marxist historians to convince us that such expedients are 'primitive" &amp; have therefore been left behind by 'History." The absoluteness of 'History' is at best a dubious proposition. We are not interested in a return to the primitive, but in a return OF the primitive, inasmuch as the primitive is the "repressed.'

       I don't like to see all the blood porn snuff footage posted around here either, like it has some entertainment value. I don't go around bitching about it....I just ignore it, and theorize on why some like to consume this information.

       It's a concerted effort to discredit this sub by associating it with anti-Jew racists -- often intentionally confused with anti-Zionists.

       Not a chance. I noticed this post when it first went up approximately 5 hours ago. I hate using trendy internetspeak, but watching the downvotes on the thread itself and the massive downvotes on the comments, this thread has absolutely been 'brigaded'. Or Counterintepro'ed or whatever you want to call it.

       As a night owl person in an outside timezone, the vote activity that has taken place here since 11PM Pacific Daylight Time has been fervid. Reddit generally dies off by 8:00 PM, and this has been Sunday, the slowest user day of the week and very late at night.

       You've got to assume that is a coordinated effort to turn people off this sub. If you want to move people out of an apartment, start by giving them really obnoxious neighbors. Then start cooking foul smelling food and playing trombone at 3 am. Warm the water slowly and boil the frog.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were trying to destroy this sub, that's how I would do it - don't attack, don't defend, just slowly make the environment an unwelcoming place, and let the discomfort do the job for you.

       I presume you are writing about the neo-nazis and white nationalists who have been posting here quite regularly. They are usually downvoted to perdition, which is where their thoughts belong, but it does make the neighborhood seem low-class.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would guess that they are here because they see this sub as a fruitful place for recruitment, considering they believe in an overarching conspiracy, albeit a discredited one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although they don't strike me as very intelligent and their arguments are easily demolished, they could wear down the disaffected and weak-minded. This is what they seem to be after. If it sounds like I'm projecting a malevolence as to their motive, just remember: they venerate a man who single-handedly revived the philosophical controversy surrounding the existence of pure evil.

       is one of the few places at reddit where we have it all: freedom, news, debate and discussion.  All that anyone needs to bring with them here is the ability to deal with the freedom and the ability to disregard the chaff.  The reward for doing that is the privilege of experiencing the best of reddit.

       I've lived in the Blueridge mountains in virginia and I've seen true blind racist hate bred thru lies and family/friends.  Just like the Westboro Baptists they use twisted logic to sell their hate that they love so much.  It is a mental illness in my opinion.

      <p>
       Edit: forgot my main thought... they have chosen to infest reddit and try to convert people to their hate through anti-zionist info.

       your post is strangely devoid of actual examples...

       "racism" is oft used as a gambit, a shield, a mask.

       using the word "jew" is not racist contrary to your politically-correct tutors and propagandists opinions. identifying and highlighting a responsible party is not racist. the british did some brutal disgusting shit building and maintaining their empire, is it racist to point that out and label them as british?

       australia and america all but exterminated their indigenous populations, so all americans and australians are racist mass-murders?

       yea, i've just about had it with this sub.  The amount of racist/anti-semitic/anti-immigrant/homophobic/anti-education folks here is just ridiculous.  i mean, i love a good conspiracy just as much as the next person, but being associated with you piece of shit, tin-foil-hat assholes who blame obama for everything is just embarrassing.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is my sincere hope that this sub returns to exposing, discussing, and theorising potential conspiracies as opposed to what it is doing now: circle jerking each other's  bigoted, fearful notions.

       Yeah, so I should brigade the brigade?! Um, no. I generally ignore, downvote or report the content, but it's just been so prolific lately that I really don't understand why "we as a whole" haven't responded. Because it does look like compliance.

       As someone who doesn't believe in mainstream narratives like the holocaust. I generally get the anti-Semitism remark, however, I do recognize the difference between a regular Jew and Zionist/elitist Jews. That's something I do notice between some people in this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand the whole white rights remarks. It comes off as clear racism, not just having pride in ones race. I would love to see whites, blacks, browns, and yellows (its a joke), to have all have strong nationalist views for their people, but not with the hate for others. I don't know if all the white nationalists are just blatantly racist or maybe they don't know how to formulate a proper response on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people from both sides need to improve on their assertions on individuals in this sub. We should both not label someone instantly.

       Aww, it's too bad you can't control the content of this sub, OP. From your post, clearly you want to. But you can't, so deal with it. People here still get to post things you don't like, and don't agree with. I admit that's rare on Reddit, and we do get censored even in here, but we have a
       <em>
        bit
       </em>
       more true freedom to say what we think here than in most other subs.

       Look at the votes on this thread, it tells you enough whats going on. We here at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       don't believe in controlling "racism", that's typical jdf tactics to stifle criticism of Israel and the Jews. It's not gonna work, and the upvotes from outside are clearly an attempt to create the illusion that the community wants this censorship. I hope the mods see this for what it is, there have been many who want to push this concept on to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember we had this sub drama with a mod who wanted to change a lot in our sub, one of the things he was pushing for was this "racism" censorship, the flak from the community was so high that he was forced to leave his position. And now they are trying to bring the idea through different means.
