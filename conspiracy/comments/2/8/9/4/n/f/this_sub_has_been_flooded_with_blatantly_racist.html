        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think it goes without saying, the difference between those of the Jewish race, religion or culture and the &quot;used to be communally understood definition&quot; of Zionists. But no, I guess I will define that when we generally talk about TPTB, the Zionists, the elite, the Illuminati, &quot;they&quot;, we were all discussing the small group of ultra-rich, extremely powerful, highly symbolic and ritualistic, old-old-old bloodlines, deeply shrouded in mystery folks that run the global political, corporate and banking scenes. (I&#39;m going to depart from the pack here by saying religion, because I think many here disagree that much of the &quot;NWO battle&quot; has been an epic religious war, for like, 1000s of years)</p>

<p>Wtf, <em>seriously, WHAT THE FUCK?!</em> has been up with the recent onslaught of low grade, blatantly racist, ignorant and inflammatory links and comments lately?! Did hundreds of regulars ditch this sub for warmer weather? Depart into all those promoted splinter-subs from the spring? Are we being brigaded by another sub? Are a handful of highly, highly misguided posters sockpuppeting the shit out of new content? </p>

<p>I wandered into this sub, shortly after Boston. I was here during the Snowden leaks and Michael Hastings. I asked a lot of dumb questions, but there were many helpful, eloquent and valiant responses. I&#39;m no where near an expert in this sub, but I feel like I have a firm grasp on the history, science, psychology and symbolic references that are &quot;the norm&quot; here. Am I alone in feeling frustration at the sudden spiral into malicious, ignorant and just plain <em>fucked</em> content, as of late? Where&#39;s the response from Moderation here? Just deleting reported content is not addressing the issue. Something has changed and it feels highly uncomfortable. I don&#39;t want to accuse this sub of being highly manipulated and shilled, but <em>she just ain&#39;t what she used to be!</em> </p>

<p>What&#39;s going on, and where&#39;s my fuggin peeps at? Cuz it&#39;s been feeling pretty middle-school-locker-room in here...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed it too. The trolling is getting a lot more coordinated. I had quite an experience today, I was targeted by several trolling groups because of some content I posted, and it was starting to make me think I was going crazy.

<p>These people post garbage alongside all the legitimate content, in order to discredit the sub or the person. Then they all vote together, which makes it look like most people agree with the trolls. </p>

<p>They&#39;re getting much better at what they do. The worst is when they create posts that <em>seem</em> legitimate, but are actually lies. &quot;Intelligent trolling&quot; I like to call it. I&#39;ve seen a lot of that the last few weeks. It&#39;s getting really really out of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on sites which are based on user contributed content.. like Reddit, Wikipedia, YouTube and others.. Somewhere around 2010-2011 SHTF, but in the past few years things have really gotten out of control. The entire baseline, the mean, has been shifted.. I believe Wikipedia was hit the hardest and earliest.. from there it spread like wildfire all over the place. It&#39;s really quite frightening what&#39;s been happening in the past few years. The bigger Reddit gets the worst it will get. I already consider Reddit an irradiated wasteland. This is the longest I&#39;ve used a single account in a while now and I&#39;ve also been on Reddit for a while. Not 8 years while like you, more like 6. However, I&#39;ve been on Wikipedia for over a decade and I watched as that place completely transformed from the inside out. As Hakim Bey, the great anarchist so beautifully said, &quot;<em>So the modern Tong cannot be elitist - but there&#39;s n reason it can&#39;t be choosy. Many non-authoritarian organizations have foundered on the dubious principle of open membership, which frequently leads to preponderance of assholes, yahoos, spoilers, whining neurotics, &amp; police agents. If a Tong is organized around a special interest (especially an illegal or risky or margin interest) it certainly has the right to compose itself according to the &#39;affinity group&quot; principle. If secrecy means (a) avoiding publicity &amp; (b) vetting possible members, the &quot;secret society&quot; can scarcely be accused o violating anarchist principles. In fact, such societies have a long &amp; honorable history in the antiauthoritarian movement, from Proudhon&#39;s dream of re-animating the Holy Vehm as a kind of &quot;People&#39;s Justice&quot;, to Bakunin&#39;s various schemes, to Durutti&#39;s &#39;Wanderers.&#39; We ought not to allow Marxist historians to convince us that such expedients are &#39;primitive&quot; &amp; have therefore been left behind by &#39;History.&quot; The absoluteness of &#39;History&#39; is at best a dubious proposition. We are not interested in a return to the primitive, but in a return OF the primitive, inasmuch as the primitive is the &quot;repressed.&#39;</em>&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-2YQgHGSj4">Video</a></p>

<p>Although they don&#39;t strike me as very intelligent and their arguments are easily demolished, they could wear down the disaffected and weak-minded. This is what they seem to be after.

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who doesn&#39;t believe in mainstream narratives like the holocaust. I generally get the anti-Semitism remark, however, I do recognize the difference between a regular Jew and Zionist/elitist Jews. That&#39;s something I do notice between some people in this subreddit. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the whole white rights remarks. It comes off as clear racism, not just having pride in ones race. I would love to see whites, blacks, browns, and yellows (its a joke), to have all have strong nationalist views for their people, but not with the hate for others. I don&#39;t know if all the white nationalists are just blatantly racist or maybe they don&#39;t know how to formulate a proper response on the subject. </p>

<p>I think people from both sides need to improve on their assertions on individuals in this sub. We should both not label someone instantly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aww, it&#39;s too bad you can&#39;t control the content of this sub, OP. From your post, clearly you want to. But you can&#39;t, so deal with it. People here still get to post things you don&#39;t like, and don&#39;t agree with. I admit that&#39;s rare on Reddit, and we do get censored even in here, but we have a <em>bit</em> more true freedom to say what we think here than in most other subs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the votes on this thread, it tells you enough whats going on. We here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> don&#39;t believe in controlling &quot;racism&quot;, that&#39;s typical jdf tactics to stifle criticism of Israel and the Jews. It&#39;s not gonna work, and the upvotes from outside are clearly an attempt to create the illusion that the community wants this censorship. I hope the mods see this for what it is, there have been many who want to push this concept on to us. </p>

<p>Remember we had this sub drama with a mod who wanted to change a lot in our sub, one of the things he was pushing for was this &quot;racism&quot; censorship, the flak from the community was so high that he was forced to leave his position. And now they are trying to bring the idea through different means. </p>
