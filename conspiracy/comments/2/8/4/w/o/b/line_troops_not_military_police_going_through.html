        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today, one of my friends posted a video of my old troop going through OC pepper spray training. I was in the army as a Cavalry Scout (in urban combat pretty much a glorified infantryman) in an  Armored Cavalry Regiment. I spent 3.5 years in active duty and we trained for urban combat in Iraq. We spent 14 months in Iraq and at no point did we EVER train for crowd/riot control or even come close to having to deal with large groups of people.</p>

<p>The reason I am posting this is because it is becoming very real to me about the militarization of America. Supposedly, we are supposed to be pulling out of the Middle East. All of a sudden, our military is being trained in non/less-lethal tactics and we have the training in place for urban combat on every military base in the country. I do not know where else we would send our military that would require that type of training. </p>

<p>I would rather not speak too much about the source of this, but it has also come to my attention that a fairly high ranking member of the police in my area has been informed to expect mass public demonstrations/riots in the very near future (2016 or before).</p>

<p>Are all of these unwarranted concerns or am I actually becoming more aware of the very real danger of our government training to combat the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fellow ex-19D here. I joined in 1996, and, same as you, there was <em>zero</em> emphasis on crowd control. Just a smattering of training on urban combat from a fighting vehicle perspective. </p>

<p>Thanks for the post, OP. The sweeping trend of militarized <em>polizei</em> and unrest-oriented military needs all the publicity possible. I have been reading about this since 2006 and before, with some early DemocracyNow! articles, along with other sources. The &quot;cop-as-soldier&quot; model is entirely disturbing; but, as far as empires go, not entirely unsuspected.</p>

<p>It seems to be a fairly natural trajectory: as the empire grows bigger and continually more ossified, large-scale internal strife seems inevitable, and the empire seeks to preserve its own existence and self-betterment. Still, it doesn&#39;t make it any less frightening or fucked up.</p>

<p>Edit: punctuation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could just be training for the next Iraqistan.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve got some time, there&#39;s a ~1.5 hour presentation from an American military geostrategist that may provide some context: <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?182105-1/pentagons-new-map-powerpoint-presentation">The Pentagon&#39;s New Map</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s an alternate grand strategic vision for the US which came out of an office Rumsfeld put together after 9/11.  We had a military designed for beating up other militaries in a post-Soviet world and didn&#39;t know what a post-9/11 world demanded.  This presentation is what they came up with.  </p>

<p>One key plank is that the military needs to get better at handling civilian populations.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Food is on the shelf. </p>

<p>Gas is still affordable (until Baghdad falls and then probably Kuwait). </p>

<p>The cell phones are still working and taking selfies. </p>

<p>Tweets are still tweeting.</p>

<p>The porn is still being fapped to. </p>

<p>Facebook is still liking pictures of lunches. </p>

<p>Reddit is still upboating cats. </p>

<p>The television is still selling to consumers. </p>

<p>Life is good right now. </p>

<p>I personally think the happening will be forced. Gun control all the way.</p>

<p>An attempt to pass a mandatory federal firearm background check on all firearm sales. De facto federal firearm registration before the confiscations.</p>

<p>The civil unrest would come if they attempted to pass/enforce a federal firearm background check on all private sales of firearms. </p>

<p>That is my personal belief and what I am personally preparing and training for.</p>

<p>Then again damn near anything could set it off. A huge mass wave of immigrants rushing the border at once (say in the millions). </p>

<p>An outbreak or dangerous infection that has a high fatality rate.</p>

<p>A natural disaster of large enough magnitude. </p>

<p>Racial divide (black/white mostly). </p>

<p>But like I said I personally think the war will be between those with guns and those without guns who want to order statism enforcement agents to remove through force the guns of the civilians. </p>
