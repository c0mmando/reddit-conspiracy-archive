<p>12 years after Afghanistan and 10 years after Iraq … well, why did we invade these countries anyway? In the first case it was to catch Usama Bin Laden, but he was allowed to escape during the airlift at Tora Bora. Then, Saddam Hussein didn’t actually have any weapons of mass destruction – but everyone knew he didn’t actually have any and that the neo-cons were lying even before the war started. Remember Valerie Plame?</p>

<p>Don’t blame the neo-cons, blame the morons that bought it.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>It is also kind of hysterical that this group, ISIS, has been disowned by The Official COBRA Command Al Qaeda. You see, ISIS used to be an “Official Affiliate” of The Official Al Qaeda, and the US supported them against Assad. (You see, it’s just like a franchise. Think McDonald’s … but instead of Delicious Cheeseburgers they serve Hate Terrorisms, and instead of Ronald McDonald the Clown it’s Usama Bin Laden the Jihadi.) But when they were no longer useful and the US stopped supporting them, The Official Al Qaeda removed their “official affiliate” status.</p>

<p>It’s ok to laugh, it’s funny.</p>

<p>Vallely also co-authored a 1980 paper with then PSYOP analyst Michael Aquino entitled From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory. MindWar is defined as “the deliberate aggressive convincing of all participants in a war that we will win that war.” The paper contrasts a use of psychological operations such as propaganda with a new approach</p>

<p>I blame the neo-cons who sold it <em>and</em> the morons that bought it.</p>

<p>Too bad nobody practiced &quot;Just Say No&quot; when it actually could have done some good.</p>

PNAC makes for a great framing device.</p>
