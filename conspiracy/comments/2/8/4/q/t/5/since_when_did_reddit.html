       ...become the voice box of the deceivers? 
Almost every single, even moderately controversial post I click into (in every sub) there are blind-faith supporters and logical fallacy disseminators.  I do not judge this because I 'lack upvotes' as I usually take no notice (and usually have negative karma anyways), but it isn't just my comments that are getting ritually downvoted.
Though this post will probably get it also, I'd at least like to say that alternative view points are most assuredly NOT welcome on this site (any longer, as if they ever really were) and are being 'censored', but not by reddit or moderators.
You have to look to your fellow user to show appreciation for that.

       Anything that gains enough traction, enough of a following, will be co-opted. They gain and maintain control by operating on this principle. That's why you get so many things - movements, people, sites, etc., 'selling out'. The operational principle is to control anything that could be a threat and you don't do that by ignoring popular movements. In fact you look for them and then begin shaping them to go your way as soon as possible.

       I feel like reddit was "ruined" two or three years ago, when it started to become infested with "normals" and became ridiculously "mainstream". Of course "normal" people are conformists and never encounter different viewpoints in their day to day life, so there ya go ... the voting system exacerbates the problem, because people just downvote something they don't agree with instead of debating it

       If you've been on reddit awhile you'll have noticed the inverse effect of popularity and group think mentality.  The more views something gets, the more infested it becomes with dare i say, shills.  A website like reddit can't exist with that many views without a large contingent of people paid to be here to control the many different interests' official stories/lies/etc (corporate/medical/political/military)

       The problem with statements like this is that with Reddit, it entirely depends on which subreddits you visit.  Some of them welcome various points of view, although many do not.  The thing is that each subreddit has it's own point of view, or things that you cannot disagree with, but it is different for each subreddit.
      </p>

       If you want different points of view, visit different subreddits.

       That was the point I was making. I do/have visited different subreddits. I have unsubscribed to about 3-4 of my regular ones because I believe...I don't know how to put it.
I don't want conversations where everyone is 'stroking each other off' for a lack of a better expression. 
But, it always degenerates into that, after the 'provocateurs' are good and downvoted.

       Yeah, most every subreddit have at least a few topics where there is a huge circlejerk over them.  The better ones (of the ones I'm subscribed to at least) are usually willing to have other viewpoints, unfortunately they tend to be few and far between.

       Unfortunately, it is really hard to fight against, at least in larger subreddits.

       By aligning yourself to a specific political label you are limiting your perspective to a single box of thoughts. Try thinking for yourself on each individual issue compared to the needs of the time. When times have gotten to liberal, like high national debt and a growing dependency on government welfare programs, more conservative action is needed to balance things out. And vice versa. It is about balance. Not the extremes of either side.

       This partisan response suggests you "don't get it". The current Democratic administration has passed draconian anti-freedom laws that would have made Reagan or the Bushes blush. The pseudo-adversarial nature of the US political system is a charade - a false dichotomy.

       The N.S. A. Domestic surveillance law was passed in 2006/07, very secret doings, along with the FISA Court approval in 2008.

       Now will you tell me just what new anti freedom laws, besides health care signed by Obama, and you seem to forget, the Republicans have had filibuster power from day one and except for a few weeks of over lap from when Franken was seate and Kennedy died.

       Just a comment, one that is probably more shared by the readers of this sub than others, which is why I posted it here. 
It's just a bust everything that is even slightly askew from the 'average interweb user' opinion is downvoted to the depths.
Call it a whine.

None of those conspiracy dealies are real, right?

       Arguing over majority/minority (not only a weak argument, because consensus is ALWAYS correct, right?)has proven that you, in this thread, are a minority, and will be 'attacked' on all sides, no matter how logical of an argument you represent.
So...
