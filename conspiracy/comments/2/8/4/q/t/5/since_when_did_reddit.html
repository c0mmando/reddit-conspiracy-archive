Almost every single, even moderately controversial post I click into (in every sub) there are blind-faith supporters and logical fallacy disseminators.  I do not judge this because I &#39;lack upvotes&#39; as I usually take no notice (and usually have negative karma anyways), but it isn&#39;t just my comments that are getting ritually downvoted.
Though this post will probably get it also, I&#39;d at least like to say that alternative view points are most assuredly NOT welcome on this site (any longer, as if they ever really were) and are being &#39;censored&#39;, but not by reddit or moderators.
You have to look to your fellow user to show appreciation for that.</p>

<p>The problem with statements like this is that with Reddit, it entirely depends on which subreddits you visit.  Some of them welcome various points of view, although many do not.  The thing is that each subreddit has it&#39;s own point of view, or things that you cannot disagree with, but it is different for each subreddit.  </p>

<p>If you want different points of view, visit different subreddits.  </p>

<p>Yeah, most every subreddit have at least a few topics where there is a huge circlejerk over them.  The better ones (of the ones I&#39;m subscribed to at least) are usually willing to have other viewpoints, unfortunately they tend to be few and far between.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is really hard to fight against, at least in larger subreddits.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By aligning yourself to a specific political label you are limiting your perspective to a single box of thoughts. Try thinking for yourself on each individual issue compared to the needs of the time. When times have gotten to liberal, like high national debt and a growing dependency on government welfare programs, more conservative action is needed to balance things out. And vice versa. It is about balance. Not the extremes of either side.</p>

<p>This partisan response suggests you &quot;don&#39;t get it&quot;. The current Democratic administration has passed draconian anti-freedom laws that would have made Reagan or the Bushes blush. The pseudo-adversarial nature of the US political system is a charade - a false dichotomy. </p>
