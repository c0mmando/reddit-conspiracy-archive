       Eh, yea something like that. The law of attraction as i mentioned is written abiut in rhinda burnes book called the secret. Theres a bunch of stuff written abiut it by very famous people. Its interesting, but unproven. So its almost like a cultish type belief, though in a very positive sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It basically talks about how our brains create brainwaves (proven) and those waves vibrate at certain frequencies (proven) based on specific thoughts (proven). So, negative thoughts vibrate differently than positive thoughts. The law of attraction teaches that certain frequencies will attract the same type of frequencies, so if you think positively, positive things will be attracted to you. And vice versa. Its very interesting. I dont necessarily bekieve it, but its pretty pleasant. It actually has a lot of similarities to buddhism and other religions (prayer for instance is just merely focusing your thoughts, and according to the law of attraction, helps to attract the outcome you are praying for...)
      </p>

       Ill try and find some links tomorrow for you if youre still interested...

       The Secret isn't incorrect as such, but it is way too simplified and misses the point imo. Karma is confounding to mortal man and attempting to alter it to gain money or some other kind of fleeting novelty is kind of a waste of human potential. My previous comment was actually a paraphrasing from a mahayana sutra fwiw.

       Gotcha.. yea i assume it is over simplified due to the proponents attempt to spread it on a mass scale. It has actually inspired me to look deeper into buddhism, though i still have to own up to that inspiration. And yes, you are definately correct that it is a bit more materialistic than other ideologies. Nonetheless, the core foundations are condusive to a happier being, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least it can serve as a wonderful segway into a more spiritual (in the nonreligious sense, as i view the two as mutually exclusive, meaning you can be spiritual without being religious and vice versa) way of life.

       Here is the full movie based off of the book. The Secret, an hour and a half long. It is interesting. The premise is like attracts like. There are many interesting views expressed by a lot of non orthodox people.

       You know I have heard stories of people coming together in a group sitting in a circle and meditating. In the middle of the circle was a bucket of water. They apparently meditated about liquid water becoming ice. Eventually the water did turn to ice.

       Now I don't know if this is true or not, but I do know that the power of suggestion has saved some lives for those dealing with terminall illnesses, simply because of their outlook.

       I agree with you. The mind is amazing. And if we have yet to unlock our full DNA potential who knows what we are capable of. My mother travels the world studying with indigenous shamans. She walks on hot coals and other odd unexplained things. Perhaps it is mind over matter? Perhaps much more. I do hope you watch the video. Aloha.

       Man I am just thinking what if we got all 7 billion of us to pause in the same moment and conscientiously think about positivity? What we could do with that is so limitless. Our petty quarrels would over. We would wonder why we ever killed another human. Fuck I wish I was high right now.

       Well, many are creating conscious communities living self sustainable life's and doing just that. Even small steps in the right direction like gardening, getting to know your neighbors, supporting local business/farmers markets, hosting a community potluck etc. All of these can lead to more awareness and creating strong foundations for community evolvement and raising vibrations.

       Possibly, although the number 13 doesn't hold as much weight with numerologists as others like 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Friday the 13th gained its notoriety as being the date that the Knights Templar got massacred.
       <sup>
        <sup>
         [citation
        </sup>
       </sup>
       <sup>

         needed]
        </sup>
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's possible something is planned as a "commemoration" of the date, but I don't think it's a very important day from a numerological standpoint.

       Interesting, maybe a "re-enactment" type massacre to comemorate that? Though, for some reason i get the feeling the templars were tools for a bigger machine.
      </p>

       However, a lot of shit has been talked about the pope... I wonder if that holds water... Something religious anyhow... What do you think?

       Regarding the Knights Templar... Absolutely! They revolutionized the banking industry following the crusades, but who has the gold now?
      </p>
      <p>
       But I haven't heard much about the new pope. What little I did hear seems to have been mainly positive, although that could just as easily be the propaganda machine spinning its gears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it seems interesting that so many collapse-type threads are hitting front page on mainstream subreddits. Perhaps something is planned regarding a financial collapse. (Significant connection to the contribution of the Knights Templar.) After all, money is the new religion...

       Could be, though im betting theyre saving the financial collapse for the finale. Maybe theyll report that russia and china finally and officially abandoned the petrodollar or something along those lines, setting the stage for the process of financial collapse to begin?
