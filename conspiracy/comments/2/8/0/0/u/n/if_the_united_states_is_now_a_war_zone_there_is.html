<p>&quot;The few who understand the system, will either be so interested from it&#39;s profits or so dependant on it&#39;s favors, that there will be no opposition from that class.&quot; — Rothschild Brothers of London, 1863</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are copy pasting quotes that have no meaning out of context.  Yes, the rothschilds heard about Waterloo a day before the London market opened.  A days&#39; head start is not enough to take over the world.</p>

<p>The Families, The Illuminati, the 300, are metaphors for the powers that be.  There isn&#39;t an all powerful organization that has secret codes and keyrings... There IS a group of corporate interests who manipulate the market... but they are not on the same team...  They are not trying to build a NWO, they are looking for profit pure and simple.</p>

<p>Using &#39;wake up&#39; proves yourself a self important prick who thinks he is smarter than other people.  Stop kidding yourself. You are not awake, you are a cog in the system that is capitalism.</p>

<p>I grow my own food on what will soon be my own land, I pay hardly any taxes, and hardly use money. You&#39;re the COG </p>

<p>“The central bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the Principles and form of our Constitution. I am an Enemy to all banks discounting bills or notes for anything but Coin. If the American People allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the People of all their Property until their Children will wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered. ” - THOMAS FUCKING JEFFERSON</p>
