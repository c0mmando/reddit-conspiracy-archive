       Let me ask a tough question. In WW2 lots of Jews died in the ghetto uprising. Which death would you pick? Fearless, and resolve knowing your doing the right thing by fighting tyranny. Or quiet obedience in a prison of fear as they lead you to slaughter?
      </p>

       Determine your values, learn to sustain yourself by growing your own food, arm yourself. Then they won't have any power over you.

       I don't think voting is the right way, it only serves the majority (see Tyranny of the majority).  What we need is a cultural revolution that changes the way people think.  Capitalism is an amoral system which assigns little value to human life.

       education is not culture.  We need a fundamental change in the way we think.  We admire rich people because they are successful.  We define success as having money.  We need to define success as something else such as in number of valued inter-personal relationships or love or charity or etc etc

       All the federal reserve does is set interest rates.  The banks that take advantage of them are the problem.  A CEO of a large corporation is beholden to his shareholders and employees, the rest of society can burn for all he cares.

       No, they print the money and it's owed back to them at interest. The Federal Reserve is not part of the government. It's a private conglomerate of those same private banks you think are the problem.

       "The few who understand the system, will either be so interested from it's profits or so dependant on it's favors, that there will be no opposition from that class." — Rothschild Brothers of London, 1863

       you are copy pasting quotes that have no meaning out of context.  Yes, the rothschilds heard about Waterloo a day before the London market opened.  A days' head start is not enough to take over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Families, The Illuminati, the 300, are metaphors for the powers that be.  There isn't an all powerful organization that has secret codes and keyrings... There IS a group of corporate interests who manipulate the market... but they are not on the same team...  They are not trying to build a NWO, they are looking for profit pure and simple.

       Using 'wake up' proves yourself a self important prick who thinks he is smarter than other people.  Stop kidding yourself. You are not awake, you are a cog in the system that is capitalism.

       “The central bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the Principles and form of our Constitution. I am an Enemy to all banks discounting bills or notes for anything but Coin. If the American People allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the People of all their Property until their Children will wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered. ” - THOMAS FUCKING JEFFERSON

       you need to understand that quotes attributed to famous people are not evidence of anything.  Jefferson also thought that slavery was necessary and had countless illegitimate children.  I am so sick of people quoting founding fathers like they are saints.  They were politicians and celebrities, they told people what they wanted to hear.

       Its been a warzone since they passed the NDAA after 9/11. It literally says in the legislation (though i dont think verbatim) that the United States if America is now a battlefield. Hence why they can detain american citizens, even on american soil, without due process or any of the good stuff we have grown accustomed to. They dont even have to tell anyone, you just....disappear.
