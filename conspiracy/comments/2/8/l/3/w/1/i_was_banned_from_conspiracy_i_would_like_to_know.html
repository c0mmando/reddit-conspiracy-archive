       Well, as stated in my initial comment, a "stupid/shit" comment is one that, among other things, "doesn't ad to the dialogue or to the fact that this sub is SUPPOSED to promote intelligence and critical thinking."
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck,
       <em>
        your yourself
       </em>
       even agreed that
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       isn't a good/great thing to do either.  Your saying "fair enough" attests to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment that you made that got you banned was unnecessary, as comments like that serve to bring this sub and intelligent discussion in it
       <em>
        down
       </em>
       - not up.  That's, again, unnecessary, and there are enough shit-head trolls and shills in this sub for people to not have to also deal with other others adding to the pile of manure, you know?

       I was the mod who banned you, after you were reported by another user. FT just happened to read the modmail before I or the other mods had a chance to.

       Who were you supposed to be verbally abusing? I see your opinion in the form if a statement. Mod says verbal abuse but I don't see it in that particular statement. Were there other statements that you made previous to what you showed us?

       I personally favor content relative to Global events as well as philosophical/contentious issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally feel this subreddit has suffered from quite a lot of Metadrama involving Moderation as it is, and this current Mod team has not warranted such drama to dominate any narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally feel this anti-Flytape drama is not only a product of that special subreddit, (that in my eyes, historically only served to encourage people to be disruptive and intolerant of this one
       <em>
        in our own cemment sections
       </em>
       ) but also serves to distract from the overall intent of this place -Discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, my suggestion is, instead of arguing and insulting users you disagree with, converse respectfully with ones you do if you can't with the ones you don't. There is such a thing as destructive behavior and I feel it is generally frowned upon here, there are plenty of other Subreddits that don't.

       Agreed. Furthermore, he wasn't even the mod who banned him. That was my doing, after he was reported by another user. Due to a drastic increase in trolling and attacks against our users and the sub as whole, I've had to be more aggressive in countering said attacks as of late.

       I consider the decision fully justified. Doubly so considering this information.

       I do not envy you guys at all. I have about 2

        1/5

       /3 weeks of moderator experience, and it was a nightmare. Not a comparison, just saying I couldn't handle a tenth of what you do for even a fraction of the time, in a

       of the experience.

       So your aggression is highly appreciated.

       It can be a pain in the ass at times. At least now I'm in a position to tackle to rampant trolling and hate spewed our direction on a daily basis, instead of having to see it occur day after day with seemingly nothing being done to address it.

       Indeed. I can say that for myself, it is because of that very tackling, that I have felt less inclined to stay silent here out of fear of said harassment.

       Well, as stated in my initial comment, a "stupid/shit" comment is one that, among other things, "doesn't ad to the dialogue or to the fact that this sub is SUPPOSED to promote intelligence and critical thinking."
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck,
       <em>
        your yourself
       </em>
       even agreed that
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       isn't a good/great thing to do either.  Your saying "fair enough" attests to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment that you made that got you banned was unnecessary, as comments like that serve to bring this sub and intelligent discussion in it
       <em>
        down
       </em>
       - not up.  That's, again, unnecessary, and there are enough shit-head trolls and shills in this sub for people to not have to also deal with other others adding to the pile of manure, you know?
