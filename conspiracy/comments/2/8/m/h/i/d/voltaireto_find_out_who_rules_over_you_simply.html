       In most cases, anyone who criticizes a prominent Jew, anything about Israel, or any Zionist policies is automatically labeled an anti-Semite and a racist. In a number of countries, anyone who questions the "official" version of the Holocaust can be imprisoned!

       Youre right, this is actually a misattributed quote that was originally from a dude named kevin strom. He was, apparantly, a "neo-nazi" racist. But i know nothing of him, and seeing the intense misunderstandings behind the use of the term "anti-semite", i wont bother to say whether or not he was indeed a racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, no matter the original tongue which spoke it (the quote), it certainly has some truth to it, and especially resonates in the clusterfuck of confusion that is the topic of zionism.

       Why is it the only argument anyone ever has these days is the extreme polar opposite of the viewpoint given?  I also love the indignation from a group of people whose government put Japanese-Americans into the same type of camps the Jews were put in during the same war.  What was the difference?  Well, we didn't start losing the war and have our supply lines cut off.

       The gas chambers was a lie, the six million killed number was a lie, the notion that all of these camps just executed prisoners all day long is a lie.  Most of the dead were due to starvation and sickness.  Yes, some were executed by the more disgusting officers I am sure, but it was far from the Jewpocalypse that it is claimed to be.

       You're right. If you account for gypsies, handicapped, homosexuals and other groups targeted, it's closer to 12 million.

       Many most certainly died from these causes, but it was again intentional. Even a quick glance at the conditions in the ghettos and camps would show this.

       I wasn't aware that the Axis was getting it's ass kicked as early as 1939... Hell, even in 1941 it was still doing fine. And I can list many examples of killings during that time period, most notably that of the

       Not too long ago i looked into the whole "holocaust denial" thing. I was curious as to why anyone would outright deny it. I didnt subscribe to that ideaology, but i feared judging those with ignorant bias, so i looked into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When indeed there are those that outright deny it ever happened (of which i have no idea if OP is a part of, nor do i care, i just dont feel like analyzing his comment history) there are many who merely questions the official story. For instance, some believe the actual number to be much lower than the accepted six million jews who were killed. Some others only question hitlers motives (for instance, instead of being a psychotic mass murderer, what if he saw the dangers of the zionist movement, however factual, and wished to stop it before the zionist movement totally and completely took over the world?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, all these folks, even those who question the smallest "official" "fact" concerning the holocaust, get lumped together as anti-semites and holocaust deniers. This is a common MO, to discredit a massive amount of people using emotional evocation and labels.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what i believe the OP is trying to discuss here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        (Again, i know nothing of the OPs past comments, posts, or responses. For all i know, he could be one of those that outright deny the holocaust. Even if he is, to which i reject that ideaology btw, he brings up a very good point.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Anti-Defamation League, for instance, uses the confusing terms, Jew (which, btw, could be in regards to ethnicity, or religious affiliation, or both), Zionism (which, btw, is a movement consisting of members who may be jewish by ethnicity, jewish by religious affiliation, both, or neither), and any criticism of Israel or the two terms above, to label those who are outspokenly against their beliefs and ideologies as anti-semites (another confusing term with more than one potential meaning), racist, or bigots.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been a controversy for sometime, despite the apparant lack of attention it receives worldwide by the common folk.

       To be honest, I rarely hear of these kinds of accusations of people calling people anti-semetic outside of this sub. And again, sometimes it's justified. If you criticize a prominent jew just on account of them being jewish, you're going to be called anti-semetic. And also, I've never seen someone who just disagrees with a policy/action by Israel that was called anti-semetic, without putting in something else that would legitimately be anti-semetic.

       You know that old adage, history is written by the victor, this is one thing I'm unfortunately finding to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler and the Nazi's did not exactly act in the way we've been told they acted. I've even found footage with holocaust refugees describing conditions of a virtually alternative reality compared to the Zionist shilled one we've been spoon fed since the late 1950s-1960s. It's kind of crazy how people can co-opt history, but I truly do believe the holocaust to simply be a another lie, and a long bridge of misinformation and ill truths by this cultist and enslaving organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some interesting parts I've learned, there were Jewish Nazi army personnel in the thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands controlling up to a hundred thousand German soldiers. Jewish Nazi officers we're not only low level, some operated closely around Hitler in the higher ranks, including one Hitler's personal driver prior to the start of WWII. Prior to WWII Hitler supported the immigration of Germanic Jewish people to Palestine and he went after Zionists in the German government, whom after WWI we're overly represented in the German government in positions of power, something you can see with the U.S. today sans the cleanse of Zionists. It's an issue that truly deserves a second glance over. Links below are basic at best... If you find anything interesting please share your sources!

       Dude, you realize that by that exact logic, you are admitting (if you are a citizen of the United States of course) that you are just as responsible for our politicians warmongering as well? Afterall, our country's citizens did (unless you subscribe to the voter fraud conspiracy theories) elect them into office.

       My point:
       <em>
        elected officials are responsible for their actions. And only elected officials are responsible for their actions. The citizenry is only responsible for holding their elected officials accountable. The lack of fulfilling the duties of the latter is usually what allows the former to go unchecked towards the road of tyranny.

       You dare to challenge the racist State of Israel?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads me to another question. Why is Israel always referred to as the "state" of Israel rather than the country of Israel? Is it because they and their brethren have so much control over the United States that they consider Israel one of the States? If it is, they probably consider it the seat of power!

       Tax evasion was NOT a charge. Preparing and filing tax returns for myself and others which I knew and believed to be false. As a staunch acolyte of nationally-known Jew income tax protestor Irwin Schiff for almost 5 years, I was not guilty because I did NOT believe that they were false.

       The law DOES give a shit whether or not I thought it was false. If I truly believed what I had been espousing for 5 years, the jury should have found acquitted me. If I had been trying to rip people off for 5 years, they should have convicted me.

       Our system of jurisprudence is not set up to determine guilt or innocence; it is a competition with the best team winning. The government had a better team than I did (just myself).

       How exactly? If I kill someone, but try and claim I didn't find killing immoral, the law wouldn't care, and would convict me anyways.

       And you were ripping of people. Those people were the government. Because of this you were convicted.

       No, it's called you clearly broke a law, and were convicted for that, as were many others, including Schiff I beleive.

       You're an idiot. Some laws, like the ones for which I was charged, are based upon the person's intent. If the person truly believes what he or she is espousing, he or she is innocent of violating the law.

       You're right. If you account for gypsies, handicapped, homosexuals and other groups targeted, it's closer to 12 million.

       Not all camps were death camps, but quite a few absolutely were.

       Many most certainly died from these causes, but it was again intentional. Even a quick glance at the conditions in the ghettos and camps would show this.
