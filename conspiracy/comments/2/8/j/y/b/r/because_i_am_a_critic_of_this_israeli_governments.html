    <div class="md"><p>The man is intelligent and speaks truth.  We are witness to their style of attack. Their perpetual misapplication of the antisemitic slur.  As with Helen Thomas for also speaking the truth.  Being critical of the murderous Zionist who criminally run Israel, you are suddenly a racist not worthy of debate, for they are, as many have reported, shameless, with policy unquestionable.  By the citizens or the world she affects. Her illegitimacy has been clearly seen through her actions over the last decade.  Watching a mob in action.  public hits, like no other culture or people.  Shameful.  Protection rackets.  Scams that even the next leading scammer just can&#39;t support.  Labeling it cruel and unnecessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as people are dumb enough to keep buying into the &quot;anti-Semite&quot; canard, the Jews will keep using it to silence their critics. It&#39;s that simple. If you keep accepting it as something of significance, as something you need to pay attention to, Jews will keep using it, as a trick, to shield themselves from criticism, or to silence any discussion they want silenced, for whatever reason. I&#39;m not talking here about the merits of any particular accusation or argument, I&#39;m talking about the &quot;anti-Semite&quot; trick that Jews use to shield themselves from criticism. The &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; label is a trick, nothing more and nothing less. Are you going to keep letting yourself be tricked? Are you going to keep giving lip service to this tired, stupid little stunt? It&#39;s up to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Political, Rothschild) Zionists =!= Jewish people. Saying the Zionists are Jewish or vice-versa is like saying &quot;all Muslims are terrorists&quot; and vice-versa.  Zionists are about as &quot;Jewish&quot; as much as Hugh Heffner is gay (not that there is anything wrong with LGBT people nor true Jewish people).</p>

<p>Zionism has only been around for a century and is a racist and genocidal ideology. </p>

<p>Of course you won&#39;t have many Zionists claiming they are such, but they will hide behind the Jewish religion to discredit anyone calling them out/criticizing them as anti-Semites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, Jewish Zionist here, feel free to downvote me to oblivion I don&#39;t really care. Before you call zionism a racist ideology, why don&#39;t you learn a little about it first? Read some Herzl and then form your opinions instead of jumping the gun. Also I&#39;m not talking about how most poeple learn these days by going to wikipedia and cherry picking what you feel are the worst aspects--I&#39;m talking about reading primary sources. It&#39;s a very sad world when people form opinions without facts!</p>

<p>I&#39;m more than happy to talk with you about why you have such a hatred for this ideology .</p>

<p>Edit: If I recall correctly, there is a Zionism (such as the one you claim to be) different from the political Zionism, which the later has a bad light.</p>
