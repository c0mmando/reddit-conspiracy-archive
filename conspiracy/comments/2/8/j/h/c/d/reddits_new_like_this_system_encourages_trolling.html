        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To understand why the new system is detrimental to the integrity of the site, you must understand why the <em>basic algorithm</em> regulating the ranking of posts is flawed. This <a href="http://technotes.iangreenleaf.com/posts/2013-12-09-reddits-empire-is-built-on-a-flawed-algorithm.html">blog post</a> that has <a href="http://np.www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1siiiw/reddits_empire_is_founded_on_a_flawed_algorithm/">3900+ cumulative upvotes</a> on <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> clearly illustrates the way <strong>time</strong> is a huge and deciding factor in which submissions are shown on the front page. Take the time to read the article (which is relatively short) to understand how, technically speaking, fast acting votes affect the ranking of submissions. In a sentence, the newer a post is, the more susceptible it is to up/downvotes affecting it&#39;s position on the &#39;what&#39;s hot&#39; section, aka, the front page. </p>

<p>This is crucial. The author of the article explains a hypothetical situation where a vote rigger with multiple sock puppet accounts can completely skew the sentiment of a submission in any subreddit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a hypothetical subreddit, <a href="/r/BirdPics">/r/BirdPics</a>, devoted to pictures of birds. An attacker despises puffins, and wants to keep all pictures of puffins off the front page. This attacker can downvote every picture of puffins, but will be outgunned by the other users who like and upvote puffin pics. On average, 350 people are watching the front page of this subreddit at any one time, so that’s a lot of upvotes to contend with.</p>

<p>Instead, <strong>our attacker will watch the new submissions very carefully, and the moment a puffin pic is submitted, immediately downvote it</strong>. If the attacker gets to the picture first, it will go negative and be utterly exiled, never again touching the front page. <strong>The only thing the attacker needs to worry about are the people watching the “New” ranking, which ignores votes</strong>. Our hypothetical subreddit only averages 10 people on the New page, so <strong>our attacker can defeat them simply by maintaining 10 sock puppet accounts</strong>, instead of the ~300 that would be needed to defeat the front page users. Just like that, our attacker has scrubbed the subreddit of all puffin pics, and the world is a poorer place for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is obvious how this can be applied to political opinions that are not held by the mainstream.</p>

<p>Because of the new system where up/downvotes are hidden, trolls and vote bots are now able to skew the ranking data much more dramatically and can effectively permanently alter the content of a given sub. The fact that downvotes are invisible makes it impossible to know whether a particular submission has a suspicious amount of up/downvote activity, especially when a sub hides the score of a comment for a given amount of time (allegedly to <em>combat</em> vote rigging). </p>

<p>Some users, (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20ic1g/every_post_in_new_gets_down_voted_within_the/">myself</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1zem0p/ive_been_watching_new_for_the_past_few_hours_and/">included</a>) have noticed these strange increases in downvoting at specific intervals and have advocated using the /new/ section of this sub to combat trolling and vote rigging. It seems now like even that vigilance is futile...</p>

<p>This is huge. Reddit is officially <strong>dead</strong>. Voting does not matter anymore as the content that reaches the front page can be, at any time, manipulated by a small group of infiltrators. It was bad before, but we have just passed the point of no return. </p>

<p>The only question is: What do we do now? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As <a href="/u/tele87">/u/tele87</a> pointed out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/28jhcd/reddits_new_like_this_system_encourages_trolling/cicc9ri">here</a>, the admins have apparently fixed the issue in regards to new submission voting being weighted more than older submission voting. However, this does not reconcile the fact that now it is still impossible to tell how many <em>downvotes</em> there were on a given submission or comment and still offers the benefit to would-be trolls and/or bots that are set on burying specific keywords and topics. User <a href="http://np.reddit.com/user/BashCo">/u/BashCo</a> has pointed out in <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/28hpop/will_todays_announcement_regarding_visibility_of/cie0jkj?context=3">this thread</a> the way in which thousands of votes were discarded to artificially presume the position that the majority of redditors are actually <em>for</em> the change. Downvote trolls are still protected because of the rule change, regardless of the fix in reddit&#39;s general vote counting algorithm. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT II:</strong> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/293oqs/new_reddit_features_controversial_indicator_for/">It seems the admins have recognized</a> the general discontent for the new voting system (presumably because of user&#39;s vocalizing their concerns), and have initiated a new &quot;<strong>†</strong>&quot; symbol as a[n] &quot;<a href="http://i.imgur.com/s5dTVpq.png">indicator on comments that hit a threshold of up/downvote balance.</a>.&quot; The only problem is that if a comment has a &quot;threshold of up/downvote balance&quot;, that would mean that the comment should be at <strong>0</strong> overall points, which really tells us nothing about the general controversy (or lack there of) of the comment. The † means absolutely nothing at all and is a shallow attempt at appeasing the people who have <strong>very valid reasons</strong> for disagreeing with the new changes.  <strong>Don&#39;t fall for it.</strong></p>

<p>Exactly, and then you have the admins going around saying &quot;the completely expected negative knee jerk reaction to the change&quot;; as if that somehow negates the overwhelming sentiment of the community against what they just did.</p>

<p>There is something more to this change than a desire to stop people saying &quot;why the downvotes&quot;, and it reeks of corporate bullshit. </p>

<p>Again...<strong>I don&#39;t care</strong>. It makes zero difference to how I browse Reddit on mobile or on my PC since I never look at those numbers. Going through life worrying about &#39;vote brigading&#39; and other nonsense is ridiculous. This is Reddit. Read comments, vote as you desire, and continue on. If you need some form of validation from imaginary points there are bigger problems in your life you should consider. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Solution Proposal</strong></p>

<p>Get rid of the down votes. Replace Up/Down Vote System with Activity Level System (ALS). ALS shows a level of interest in the post or comment and is set by an on-off check mark button to indicate interest. The ALS could show number of &quot;on&quot; clicks plus a number of comments (in the post or comments responding to a comment) multiplied by a preset factor (because responding comments should be wighted more then a click). </p>

<p>Since ALS is always a positive number showing interest, ALS cannot be used in a negative way since any action would only promote a post or a comment, i.e., any activity whether in support or opposition would improve the ranking (which is ALS over time).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea i have noticed this too, i am a watcher mainly and rarely cast votes in either direction. But the level of astroturfing, vote abuse and Straight account attacking in the past year has exponentially gotten worse month by month.</p>

<p>A few accounts i have see who are active in the comment section and submissions in the &quot;news&quot; reddits are getting more and more buried through the current system. </p>

<p>It reminds me of a book i read years ago about how every counterculture (not that reddit is) hits a level where it becomes big enough that threatens the status quo and so it needs to be made profitable. </p>

<p>So Main stream Culture/corporations cut up the the movement into mass producible items that hollowly symbolize and defuse. So you get tie dyed shirts at sears, silver safety pins at Tiffany&#39;s, Cut up jeans  at Macys and whatever shills/bots regurgitating corporate lines on reddit(twitter too). And then burying any discerning voices in a sea of Disinformation and name calling. </p>

<p>Nah, it&#39;s just that the women and beta pussies have taken over.  First they put their shrill subreddit onto the main page and now they have taken away downvotes because downvotes hurt their feelings.</p>

Even journalists covering the <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> censorship controversies can see what this site has become, in stark contrast to what it once was and what it once represented (RIP Aaron Schwartz). </p>

<p>Still, it&#39;s not too late for reddit to address these grievances reasonably, to actually stand by their users, who made this site what it is, rather than rigid policy and outside influences. Of course we all know <em>that&#39;s</em> going to happen..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t need to define vote tampering. But you could tell in smaller subs like this if certain posts were to have an unusual number of up or down votes. There was an open record of the direction an number of votes, and the whole thing about fuzzy numbers is basically rubbish. I agree in larger subs and front page posts it is harder to tell if something has either been downvoted and censored or upvoted because of money and promoted content. Now there is no way to even look at any of that. The votes go in a black box, and are in all doubt meaningless now.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the difference exactly?  At least, what&#39;s the difference that you couldn&#39;t tell by simply reading the comments?  (Which is what you should be doing anyways)</p>

<p>Where did you get that number from and what does it have to do with anything?  Not to mention that I can&#39;t show you a thread with 100 votes because, as we&#39;ve been discussing this whole time, reddit no longer provides up and downvote numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s super cool, man. Here I am sitting at home swimming in all the jew-gold they bought me with to convince me to be a zionist shill and you totally blow my cover. All these years, nobody suspected that my reddit account that mostly posts in subreddits about video games and nerdy TV shows was really just a cover story for that one time, three years later, that I would make fun of some egotist who had discovered the secret jewish takeover. I play the long game. </p>

<p>Why&#39;d you delete your post where you so thoroughly <em>told</em> me? Too obvious? About to blow your cover as a troll? </p>

<p>Or simply too embarrassing maybe. Doing an &quot;impression&quot; of another poster is definitely cringe-worthy. I really liked your impression of me, though. You got the way I write <em>down</em>, spelling errors and all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah so it is. Thank you for the updated article.</p>

<p>The increased probability of trolling and vote manipulation due to scores being hidden is still very real. Although maybe now voting on /new/ may not have the effect it did before the algorithm was fixed, vote brigades and bots can simply downvote whatever they like into oblivion without being noticed. Taking away the  up/down vote ratio makes it impossible to know whether or not something is suspiciously manipulated or not.</p>

<p>The point that I was making was that even the technique of keeping a watchful eye on the /new/ section to combat vote manipulation is futile now since anything can just be voted on by however many sock puppet accounts you want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understood the issue was that if you downvoted a new post before it got any upvotes it would disappear, and that&#39;s what they fixed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As before, the rankings are now positive with the new algorithm. But the biggest change is that newer submissions now rank higher than older ones. You&#39;d think that would have been the case before, but submissions with a negative scores would quickly disappear from the front page with the previous flawed algorithm. Now, these stories have at least a chance to show up if their score isn&#39;t too abysmal.</p>

<p>Why the fuck do people give loyalty to social networks, corporations and banks?</p>

<p>Because Grandma told them, &quot;I&#39;ve used Ford / Kellog&#39;s / GE / Gerber all my life&quot;?</p>

<p>TBH, I don&#39;t understand it, either; the big corporations moan weekly about the Millennials&#39; lack of &quot;brand loyalty&quot;. Inertia, however, is just as powerful as more dynamic physical forces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people are misunderstanding what&#39;s happening. The numbers were <em>always</em> hidden. Read the blog post for a more detailed explanation, but basically the numbers of upvotes and downvotes were fake. Every single post and comment once it reached a certain volume would have fake upvotes and downvotes added to it which is why all top submissions would be in the 55-65% range. This was done to fool spam bots. </p>

<p>One of the main reasons why the admins chose to change the system was their annoyance and having to <em>constantly</em> explain to people that no, 900 people did not downvote this.</p>

<p>The change is actually an improvement in a way. Now, the percentage is closer to the actual ratio of upvotes to downvotes and still maintains the protection against spam bots. </p>

<p>The one thing it can&#39;t show is if a submission gets a huge amount of downvotes and no upvotes, but oh well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, yes you can. You can tell if a certain domain has a higher percentage of upvotes when other domains are near %0. Also, this wasn&#39;t what busted the mods.

<p>Also, reddit has built in filters for accounts from the same IP address voting on the same submission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, comment scores were fudged in a very similar fashion. I ran a few experiments at times. High scoring comments were guaranteed to have around %30 downvotes. Mid-ranged comments were closer to %20. And no comment would ever get to 7 or above without seeing at least one. </p>

<p>And they would change from minute to minute. A comment at +7/-3 one minute may be +6/-2 the next. And this went for comments that were weeks old, so it wasn&#39;t like people would be constantly switching their votes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Often times I would see an unpopular post down voted heavily and there would be a noticeable correlation of comments that were likewise negative.</p>

<p>Other times I would see a post down voted heavily where most, if not all, of the comments were very positive.  These incidents are very suspicious to me, and I liked having the ability to analyze the fuzzy data for myself.  I can no longer do that.</p>

<p>If reddit thought the numbers were useless, why not make the numbers useful instead of just removing them? Surely they can find a way to rank submissions without fuzzing the numbers.</p>

<p>So instead of removing data all together, make it more accessible! Make it true!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why they kept the useless system in place for this long. It had something to do with tricking spam bots and vote bots.</p>

<p>And what do you consider &quot;down voted heavily&quot;? Like I said, the total was the only thing that mattered, not the down vote number. Either way, I don&#39;t find those things suspicious. It has a lot to do with the type of guy who would glance at a submission and upvote or downvote versus the guy who would read the submission and comment on it. Much of the time I find that a submission with a catchy click-bait title (SNOWDEN REVEALS HOW US TROOPS MASSACRED MALAYSIANS!!) get tons of upvotes even though the comments may be about how the article is heavily biased and the story is full of holes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. </p>

<p>All the upvote/downvote numbers on every tool (such as RES, Reddit Reveal or various Android apps) come from the same source, the reddit client API. You can see the raw data for yourself by adding .json to the end of any reddit link. And all of those numbers are fudged to a certain percentage, about 30% of the votes are fake, so if you see 70 upvotes and 30 downvotes, the reality is probably more like 45 upvotes and 5 downvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but reddit is far from &#39;officially dead&#39;, it&#39;s actually still very much alive.</p>

<p>The majority of users don&#39;t give a fuck about the voting system and will only start feeling the pain of people trying to fix shit when the number of good posts starts going down. </p>

<p>If this new &#39;feature&#39; is really that bad then the admins would likely go back to the way the voting system was before. I don&#39;t understand why they did this or if there was any kind of explanation by the admins about it, but it does seem pretty fucking stupid.</p>

<p>The god damn system worked, why did they feel they needed to change it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t need to define vote tampering. But you could tell in smaller subs like this if certain posts were to have an unusual number of up or down votes. There was an open record of the direction an number of votes, and the whole thing about fuzzy numbers is basically rubbish. I agree in larger subs and front page posts it is harder to tell if something has either been downvoted and censored or upvoted because of money and promoted content. Now there is no way to even look at any of that. The votes go in a black box, and are in all doubt meaningless now.</p>

<p>Then you must not have been looking, it was very clear with many posts both on this sub and elsewhere - particularly when viewing the posts in the new queue.</p>

<p>Edit to add: It also helped with noticing when certain comments or threads were being bombarded with downvotes - there&#39;s an enormous difference between a post or comment that&#39;s +2/-1 and one that&#39;s +46/-45.  But with the new voting system, there&#39;s no difference at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Solution Proposal</strong></p>

<p>Get rid of the down votes. Replace Up/Down Vote System with Activity Level System (ALS). ALS shows a level of interest in the post or comment and is set by an on-off check mark button to indicate interest. The ALS could show number of &quot;on&quot; clicks plus a number of comments (in the post or comments responding to a comment) multiplied by a preset factor (because responding comments should be wighted more then a click). </p>

<p>Since ALS is always a positive number showing interest, ALS cannot be used in a negative way since any action would only promote a post or a comment, i.e., any activity whether in support or opposition would improve the ranking (which is ALS over time).</p>
