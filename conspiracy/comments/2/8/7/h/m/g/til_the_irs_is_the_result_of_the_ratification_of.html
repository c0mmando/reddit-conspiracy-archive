      <p>
       Ive heard the argument that the IRS and its IRC are unconstitutional. I liked the sound of that, but never bothered to figure out why. So, lets discuss this little troddened theory that may or may not hold water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through a some research, one source explained that several statesin the early 20th century had, in their constitution, set forth how to deal with a proposed amendment to the constitution. They set rules and legislation within their constitution that prohibited them from voting to ratify a proposed amendment until after the very next state elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       This served to insure that the people got to have a say in whether or not the amendment should be ratified by making the proposed amendment a huge part in the campaign platforms of the potential incumbents; it served to act as a cool-down period to reduce the tendency to approve an idea because it is the moments trend (im feelin gun control parallels here).
      </p>
      <p>
       Other states, for various other reasons, have failed to properly ratify the amendment. Some of these reasons are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some, like florida, outright rejected the proposal
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some, like Ohio and California, never sent back certified, signed and seal copies of the proposal, which, if anyone has ever had to hand in a sealed copy of your college transcripts (for instance, to be accepted into the United States Navy at a higher rank), if the seal is broken, the transcripts credibility fails to exist, and another copy must be acquired
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The constitution of some states did not grant the state government the authority of taxing income, and therefore (alledgedly) did not have the authority to pass along that authority to the federal government
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some states, like North Carolina and Mississippi and Colorado, had outlined in their constitution that before voting to ratify a proposed amendment to The Constitution, the proposal must be read on three seperate days, in order to provide ample chance for members to be present should they be absent one day, to serve as a cool-down period, and to insure better understand of the proposal as sometimes some members in our government feel its okay to vote on a proposal, without even reading it! (Like that one chick who said, "You have to pass it to know whats in it!")
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Anyways, long story short, back in 1913, 36 states were required to vite in approval for ratification of the 16th Amendment which allowed fir the creation of the Internal Revenue Service.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a little bit of digging, it turns out that only about 20 states successfully and lawfully casted an approving vote--just a little more than half of what was needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, seeing whats going on today with all the scandals involving our beloved income rapists that is the IRS, is it really hard to believe that even its creation couldve been fraudulent? (I dont think i even have to ask you how they would benefit by forcing this scam back then...)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         Regardless of its believability, I am asking knowledgable individuals here to either provide evidence or information for or against this claim, and, provide any other reasons why the IRS is or isnt constitutional. Also, I would be willing to discuss other possibly unconstitutional bullshit scams our government has delivered us, like the War on Drugs, Obamacare, etc...

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       §63a - “taxable income” means “gross income” minus...
      </p>
      <p>
       §62a - “adjusted gross income” means, in the case of an individual, “gross income” minus...
      </p>
      <p>
       §64 - “ordinary income” includes any gain ... (watch for the word gain in the following Supreme Court decisions).
      </p>
      <p>
       §61a - “gross income” means all “income” from whatever source derived... (Note the Edwards vs. Keith Decision below)
      </p>
      <p>
       §??? - “income” means ????? ............... Nowhere to be found in The Internal Revenue Code!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the only definitions in Title 26, the Internal Revenue Code, that include the word “income” yet none of them actually define the word “income”. The definition of the word “income” does not exist in Title 26. How do we really know this for sure? The Supreme Court tells us so:

       U.S. v. Ballard, 535 F2d 400, cert denied, 429 U.S. 918, 50 L.Ed.2d 283, 97 S.Ct. 310 (1976)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        … the general term 'income' is not defined in the Internal Revenue Code...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Note that in section 61a the term “income” is claimed by IRS “agents acting in the governments behalf” (see the 2 decisions at the top of this page) to be defined by saying “from whatever source derived”. Let's look at §61a a little closer:
      </p>
      <p>
       §61a - “... gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) the following items:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Compensation for services...”
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: One receives $100 as compensation for services. How does one derive income from that $100 source? One simply invests the $100 and any any resulting profit is income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exactly what is this thing, this “income” that is taxed? Where can we find the legal definition as used in Title 26? Let's ask the Supreme Court:

It taxes only income 'derived' from many different sources; one does not 'derive income' by rendering services and charging for them... IRS cannot enlarge the scope of the statute." (NOTE: This is taken out of context but is an eye-opening statement nonetheless. It ties in perfectly with the other cases cited here.)

      <blockquote>

        ... whatever may constitute income, therefore, must have the essential feature of gain to the recipient. This was true when the 16th Amendment became effective, it was true at the time of Eisner v. Macomber Supra, it was true under Section 22(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1938, and it is likewise true under Section 61(a) of the I.R.S. Code of 1954.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yet it is plain, we think, that by the true intent and meaning of the Act the entire proceeds of a mere conversion of capital assets were not to be treated as income. Whatever difficulty there may be about a precise and scientific definition of 'income' it imports, as used here, something entirely distinct from principal or capital either as a subject of taxation or as a measure of the tax; conveying rather the idea of gain or increase arising from corporate activities. As was said in Stratton's Independence vs. Howbert, 231 U.S. 399, 415: 'Income may be defined as the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined.'

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is obvious that these decisions in principle rule the case at bar if the word 'income' has the same meaning as the Income Tax Act of 1913 that it had in the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, and that it has the same scope of meaning was in effect decided in Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 330, 335, where it was assumed for the purposes of decision that there was no difference in its meaning as used in the Act of 1909 and in the Income Tax Act of 1913. There can be no doubt that the word must be given the same meaning and content in the Income Tax Acts of 1916 and 1917 that it had in the Act of 1913. When to this we add that in Eisner v. Macomber, Supra, arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, with the addition that it should include 'profit gained through a sale or conversion of capital assets,' there would seem to be no room to doubt that the word must be given the same meaning in all of the Income Tax Acts of Congress that was given to it in the Corporation Excise Tax Act and that what that meaning is has now become definitely settled by decisions of this court.

        ... by the previous ruling it was settled that the provisions of the Sixteenth Amendment conferred no new power of taxation but simply prohibited the previous complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning from being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged and being placed in the category of direct taxation subject to apportionment by a consideration of the sources from which the income was derived, that is by testing the tax not by what it was -- a tax on income, but by a mistaken theory deduced from the origin or source of the income taxed.

       Some other interesting decisions:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43 (1906)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...we are of the opinion that there is a clear distinction in this particular between an individual and a corporation, and that the latter has no right to refuse to submit its books and papers for an examination at the suit of the state. The individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to the state or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to open his doors to an investigation, so far as it may tend to incriminate him. He owes no such duty to the state, since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and property. His rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the state, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his rights are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law. He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the other hand, the corporation is a creature of the state. It is presumed to be incorporated for the benefit of the public. It receives certain special privileges and franchises, and holds them subject to the laws of the state and the limitations of its charter. Its powers are limited by law. It can make no contract not authorized by its charter. Its rights to [201 U.S. 43, 75] act as a corporation are only preserved to it so long as it obeys the laws of its creation.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a reserved right in the legislature to investigate its contracts and find out whether it has exceeded its powers. It would be a strange anomaly to hold that a state, having chartered a corporation to make use of certain franchises, could not, in the exercise of its sovereignty, inquire how these franchises had been employed, and whether they had been abused, and demand the production of the corporate books and papers for that purpose. The defense amounts to this: That an officer of a corporation which is charged with a criminal violation of the statute, may plead the criminality of such corporation as a refusal to produce its books. To state this proposition is to answer it. While an individual may lawfully refuse to answer incriminating questions unless protected by an immunity statute, it does not follow that a corporation, vested with special privileges and franchises, may refuse to show its hand when charged with an abuse of such privileges.

        Silence can only be equated with fraud where there is a legal or moral duty to speak, or where an inquiry left unanswered would be intentionally misleading. . .

       You cannot quote U.S. Law to people who don't care about and violate U.S. Law. Courts do not care about the law. They literally make it up as they go along. It's called 'tort.'
      </p>
      <p>
       All of your quotations of tax code are irrelevant in a court of law.
      </p>
      <p>
       (See: Sherry Jackson and Larken Rose for details)
      </p>
      <p>
       That said I have halted participation in the tribute system [Federal Income Tax]. Should they turn their attention toward me (it's possible) I will not be quoting their law - the law they break daily. I will deflect their attacks through a very specific line: I'll challenge their standing. This is a complex concept, but it boils down to these points:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Violation of a right.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Injury.
      </p>
      <p>
       A code violation could only count as a violation of a right if and only if the codes applied to you. But there is no evidence [that I know of] to prove that their codes and laws apply to you. Yeah, sure their paperwork says they own you if you're born on land they've claimed to be theirs, but that has nothing to do with you. It would be like if I held up a piece of paper that said I had a right to everyone's house in North America. It's meaningless if it's not connected to the people from their end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without some kind of evidence that their codes apply the default position is that they don't apply to you or anyone you know. The U.S. Federal government is completely illegitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way of looking at this would be to use their own paperwork to see if their own paperwork match. The U.S. Supreme court found that a citizen was a member of a body politic owing a duty of allegiance in exchange for a duty of protection; these are reciprocal duties. The U.S. Supreme court has also found that they have no duty to protect anyone. So the only reason for government is to protect people and yet they don't protect anyone. Great - they just invalidated themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that any of this matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped participating for purely ethical reasons.

       It would seem to me that rather than an individual taking it upon themselves to declare that the 16th was ratified incorrectly, the proper venue would be the Supreme Court itself, as they seem to have the ability to judge the Constitution itself (Article III, Section 2), "The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution[...]"
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect that fighting it with nonconforming and disobeying the IRS will just end up with the outspoken individual being mired in the bottomless well of the Tax Code and never able to prove standing to challenge the constitutionality of the 16th itself. It would be a fascinating court case to watch, though.

       The supreme court already ruled the 16th amendment granted congress no new powers. In a court of law I would simply put it in the IRS to show the law that mandates US citizens file a 1040.

      <p>
       Hint: there is no such law.

       I read that summary. What I didn't read is where the Supreme Court actually ruled on if the 16th was constitutionally ratified, which was the original assertion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the attorneys for either side don't argue the point on if the ratification was legitimate in the first place, then it's not a question the court will address.

       I can look up the case if you can provide the name. I am specifically looking for one where SCOTUS ruled on the constitutionality of the ratification of the 16th, not whether it's interpreted to grant new powers (which is a different issue).

       Wish I could help but I've only heard it cited in documentary's and I don't remember.

       You cannot get them to acknowledge their own laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that they ignore and break their own laws daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you would have no standing in a court of law to sue or prosecute them.
      </p>

       Why? They have no fiduciary duties to you. They do not represent you in any legally speaking.
