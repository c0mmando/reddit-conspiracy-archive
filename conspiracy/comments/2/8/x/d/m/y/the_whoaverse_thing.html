       They don't care though, according to the multiple threads about it.  They don't care so much, in fact, that they registered 1000000 accounts with

       It's an honest point of contention though, those shills always bomb the threads with downvotes, especially the Zionist holocaust truther and vaccination information threads, and now with the new reddit counter system its a little harder to tell where they're trying to derail or bury a thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your interested, holocuast truther thread I made, based on hard evidence showing the camps were not in fact death camps but simple internment camps along with footage of survivors from Zionist Spielberg's holocaust casting footage showing the real events of the interment camps.

       The historical revisionism is so bad, the more I dig the more I step into an alternative reality with Hilter and the Nazi govenrment.

       I just messaged the creator of whoaverse to let him know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just told him what was going on in case he doesn't want that type of shit going down. So if he disapproves, maybe he will do something about it.  I mean it can't be that difficult to see that the same IP address has registered a bunch of accounts.
      </p>

       It would be pretty fucking hilarious to see all of those usernames become available again.  I think
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       posters would actually cry for not getting their way.

       I never said anything about rights. That is why I told the creator of the site.

       So yeah.  It could very well be that he thinks that we should have the right to our old usernames and they don't have the right to their sub verse.  It's his site, and if that is the route he takes, it'll be hilarious to watch.

       Meh, whatever.  I literally told him what was happening as a just-so-you-know.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case he didn't want one user squatting on a shit ton of usernames.  Because that's a problem.  That user could try to sell the usernames back to people, or try to impersonate somebody.  And someone made a bot that registers reddit posters automatically.  I put an issue on the GitHub about captchas and they added them so that should help, but who knows how many usernames that one person registered already.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       usernames as it is about security.  The added bonus of pissing off

       made it worth the 15 seconds.

       it's corrupt. you want to pretend it's not, because it doesn't benefit this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's corrupt for you to want to punish people who reserve usernames from reddit and not punish people who reserve subreddits from reddit simply because one benefits you and the other doesn't.

       Letting somebody control one subverse isn't corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are general rules on most sites that are against mass account creation, especially with bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to pretend like squatting on one subverse and a user creating a bot to squat on a shit ton of usernames is the same, you're pretty dumb...
      </p>
      <p>
       This has nothing to do with what benefits who.  Letting people create accounts in mass using bots is possibly the stupidest thing any site could do, which is why most sites have rules against it.  Stop crying.

       And I never said that the only reason I was against what they were doing was because it didn't benefit this subreddit, but I'm glad you one upped me with that ad hominem, it really proves your point.  In fact I have explained exactly why I'm against it you're just too stupid to read apparently
      </p>
      <p>
       The "punishment" is for using bots to create accounts in mass, not reserving a username.   Even I reserved my username.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to explain it to you again.  If you don't get it, look up some lessons on reading comprehension.  Google is very easy to use and I think you could benefit from it.

       this can also be done manually. this was your argument. if it's your argument i'd be surprised if you would want this to be done with any amount of usernames.
      </p>
      <p>
       as a matter of fact, i wouldn't be surprised it it was done manually seeing as how my username appeared in recent threads and wasn't taken.

       or
       <a href="/r/botwatch">

       bragging about making the bot.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone with experience making Reddit bots I know that that user could easily change it to take usernames from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       .
      </p>

       And yes, it can be done manually, but it would take much longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I raised the issue on the github and a captcha system has been implemented(you know, the things that were designed to stop bots from doing this).
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I was kind of right.  Sorry buddy, you aren't going to convince me that basic security on a website isn't something to worry about.  I mean, what's your argument here? Are you trying to say that it can be done manually so don't even worry about it?
      </p>

       Somebody could break into the guys house and change all the data manually if they really wanted to, so why even have usernames and passwords?

       i'm saying you shouldn't worry about squatting of individual usernames. if it is done by a bot (which you've shown), i'd agree that's not beneficial to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       my argument is that i don't see why your username here should need to be available on a different domain any more than a subreddit here doesn't deserve to be available on a different domain.
      </p>
      <p>
       if your original problem was the creation of multiple accounts with bots that would be one thing because you could make a bot that makes accounts with arbitrary names, but the complaint seems to be that the bot is making account names that are used by people in this subreddit.

       I never said it should be!
      </p>
      <p>
       If people are making multiple clone accounts, even manually, especially as early on as it is with the site(it's in alpha), I would say that that shouldn't be allowed purely because squatting on usernames from different sites is kind of shady,
       <em>
        in my personal opinion
       </em>
       .  So I passed the info on to the person who has the right to decide how the site is run.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never claimed that we had a right to our usernames, and I don't think we do, you were the one that claimed that you knew what I thought/was saying.  Jesus fucking Christ dude, you talk about logical fallacies when the basis of your argument came from putting words in my mouth and assuming what my stance was.  I say one thing and you interpret it in a way that says what you want me to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're acting like a fucking twit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you aren't doing it intentionally, you really need to work on your reading comprehension skills. At first I was just kind of being a dick, and now I feel bad because I feel like you might have a legitimate learning disability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  here is a guide to help you out a little bit.  if somebody says I don't like "A", that does not mean that they are saying, "I have a right to not be affected by 'A'".  To suggest that that is what they are saying is fallacious, and a demonstration of your tenuous understanding of basic logic.

       So I'm not allowed to voice my opinion? I'm not allowed to share my opinion with the creator of the site to see if he shares the same opinion?
      </p>
      <p>
       The site is an alpha, and I'm pretty sure that most sites have rules against squatting on usernames purely to squat on usernames so it's not really that far out of the realms of reality to think the site creator shares the same opinion and might want similar rules.

       All four posts say this exact same thing and there are a fuck ton more spamming like crazy by numerous usernames. Why do people to do this shit?

       Looks like Atko settled it, but account registration has been temporarily disabled due to this bot. :(

       So....some of us casually make a new sub on a different site.  And make a jab at our "rivals" by squatting on their stupid subreddits name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then these weirdos militantly go and register loads of our regular users, related subreddits, and anything they can get their grubby little mitts on out of sheer butthurt?

       Depending on the amount of usernames they are registering, we might be able to get them outright banned from the site considering it is a college students home computer(or something like that) and they are probably slowing down the system.

       Apparently every variation of my username was registered within the last 20 minutes. What the actual fuck. Even changing which letters are capital makes no difference. Serious fuckery is afoot here.

       So I'm not allowed to voice my opinion? I'm not allowed to share my opinion with the creator of the site to see if he shares the same opinion?
      </p>
      <p>
       The site is an alpha, and I'm pretty sure that most sites have rules against squatting on usernames purely to squat on usernames so it's not really that far out of the realms of reality to think the site creator shares the same opinion and might want similar rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see that you're grasping for straws at this point, have fun.
