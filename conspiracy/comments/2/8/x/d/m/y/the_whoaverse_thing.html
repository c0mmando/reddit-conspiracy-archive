<p>If your interested, holocuast truther thread I made, based on hard evidence showing the camps were not in fact death camps but simple internment camps along with footage of survivors from Zionist Spielberg&#39;s holocaust casting footage showing the real events of the interment camps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh, whatever.  I literally told him what was happening as a just-so-you-know.</p>

<p>In case he didn&#39;t want one user squatting on a shit ton of usernames.  Because that&#39;s a problem.  That user could try to sell the usernames back to people, or try to impersonate somebody.  And someone made a bot that registers reddit posters automatically.  I put an issue on the GitHub about captchas and they added them so that should help, but who knows how many usernames that one person registered already.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> usernames as it is about security.  The added bonus of pissing off <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> made it worth the 15 seconds. </p>

<p>There are general rules on most sites that are against mass account creation, especially with bots.</p>

<p>If you want to pretend like squatting on one subverse and a user creating a bot to squat on a shit ton of usernames is the same, you&#39;re pretty dumb...</p>

<p>The &quot;punishment&quot; is for using bots to create accounts in mass, not reserving a username.   Even I reserved my username.</p>

<p>this can also be done manually. this was your argument. if it&#39;s your argument i&#39;d be surprised if you would want this to be done with any amount of usernames.</p>

<p>As someone with experience making Reddit bots I know that that user could easily change it to take usernames from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.</p>

<p>And yes, it can be done manually, but it would take much longer.</p>

<p>Either way, I raised the issue on the github and a captcha system has been implemented(you know, the things that were designed to stop bots from doing this).</p>

<p>I guess I was kind of right.  Sorry buddy, you aren&#39;t going to convince me that basic security on a website isn&#39;t something to worry about.  I mean, what&#39;s your argument here? Are you trying to say that it can be done manually so don&#39;t even worry about it?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m saying you shouldn&#39;t worry about squatting of individual usernames. if it is done by a bot (which you&#39;ve shown), i&#39;d agree that&#39;s not beneficial to anyone.</p>

<p>my argument is that i don&#39;t see why your username here should need to be available on a different domain any more than a subreddit here doesn&#39;t deserve to be available on a different domain.</p>

<p>if your original problem was the creation of multiple accounts with bots that would be one thing because you could make a bot that makes accounts with arbitrary names, but the complaint seems to be that the bot is making account names that are used by people in this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said it should be!</p>

<p>If people are making multiple clone accounts, even manually, especially as early on as it is with the site(it&#39;s in alpha), I would say that that shouldn&#39;t be allowed purely because squatting on usernames from different sites is kind of shady, <em>in my personal opinion</em>.  So I passed the info on to the person who has the right to decide how the site is run.</p>

<p>I never claimed that we had a right to our usernames, and I don&#39;t think we do, you were the one that claimed that you knew what I thought/was saying.  Jesus fucking Christ dude, you talk about logical fallacies when the basis of your argument came from putting words in my mouth and assuming what my stance was.  I say one thing and you interpret it in a way that says what you want me to say. </p>

<p>You&#39;re acting like a fucking twit.</p>

<p>And if you aren&#39;t doing it intentionally, you really need to work on your reading comprehension skills. At first I was just kind of being a dick, and now I feel bad because I feel like you might have a legitimate learning disability.</p>

<p>Edit:  here is a guide to help you out a little bit.  if somebody says I don&#39;t like &quot;A&quot;, that does not mean that they are saying, &quot;I have a right to not be affected by &#39;A&#39;&quot;.  To suggest that that is what they are saying is fallacious, and a demonstration of your tenuous understanding of basic logic.</p>

<p>For the record, I am using the same username over there.</p>

<p>However both axolotl and flytape had their names squatted on. We&#39;ll see if I can get the admin over there to give those guys there accounts as opposed to the malicious trolls. Don&#39;t want to set a bad precedent though, as one of the good guys took bipolarbear already :)</p>

<p>All four posts say this exact same thing and there are a fuck ton more spamming like crazy by numerous usernames. Why do people to do this shit?</p>

<p>Looks like Atko settled it, but account registration has been temporarily disabled due to this bot. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So....some of us casually make a new sub on a different site.  And make a jab at our &quot;rivals&quot; by squatting on their stupid subreddits name.</p>

<p>Then these weirdos militantly go and register loads of our regular users, related subreddits, and anything they can get their grubby little mitts on out of sheer butthurt?</p>

<p>Way to show the world your true colors tardos.  Really not helping your &quot;WE&#39;RE THE SANE ONES!  THEY STALK <em>US</em>! DEATHTHREATS!  RACISTS!  TINFOIL etc etc.&quot; argument much....</p>
