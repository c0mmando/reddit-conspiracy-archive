    <div class="md"><p>Baby steps for most people. It cannot happen overnight unfortunately, and even after that the new ideas have to be put into place. Just a question, not being disrespectful, i genuinely would like to have a conversation and hear others ideas. </p>

<p>What would you have happen? would you create some kind of barter system? How would you regulate the country, firemen, police, water, food, electricity, public buildings, etc etc. Would you still use government philosophy and have one central gov, or would you allow for the more smaller governments(county,state,city) to have the complete power over their areas. </p>

<p>I understand a lot and agree with you initially, but there is no side to which has any planning long term. Honestly, most humans are still behind on evolution mentally and cannot grasp certain concepts. The animal still lives inside them. I don&#39;t like the police state, or agree with the excessive use of force. If we had no police though, you will be see the chaos. Example of this was when a hurricane ran through my town/city about 8 years ago, power was out for over a week, and things got really bad. My neighbour was held at gun point for his gas. Peoples houses were robbed, stores were broken into. It was chaos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a reason the NWO reviles activism, because its gives others a mental template to act against the government, if one person acts, in a psychological perspective it spreads the concept/act/idea like virus to the next person, with enough people creating a stampede. This entire system is design to pacify and prevent a violent revolt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Violence?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t the main problem with the &#39;NWO&#39; that they use violence?</p>

<p>If one used violence to jprevent violence wouldn&#39;t that just be more violence?</p>

<p>Why not simply stop paying the &#39;NWO&#39; to be violent?</p>

<p>Why not just halt compliance with their demands?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, turn off the TV, stop paying them to be violent and live a better life.</p>

<p>You&#39;re pretty much there.</p>

<p>I can tell by your phrasing that you&#39;re still highly enthusiastic abut all this. In a couple years you&#39;ll calm down and start looking for long term solutions that don&#39;t involve deposing an old tyranny for a new tyranny.</p>

<p>Strangely enough the most plain and unspectacular solutions seem to be the best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that.  If enough people got out there they would pay attention. Get the police and military on the peoples side and they will shit solid gold bricks to maintain their positions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not unlike the schoolyard bully analogy. Right now he is fighting back but a good punch in the nose will send him walking.</p>

<p>The only reason they can bully us around is because they control the  central banking money supply.</p>
