       Well, sorry to burst your world-view bubble, but the information in the doc was actually correct and valid regardless of its original intent.  Making a doc like this and calling it a "joke" is like making a doc on child prostitution as a "joke" and using The Franklin Scandal and

       No the US is a mess. I mean the indoctrination where literally anything that attacks the US must be right. Russia, NK, China are no better than the US. In fact, they may be worse! Shocking.

       Well, I can only assume you're referring to me in thinking that
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       personally think that "anything that attacks the US must be right."  If you are thinking/inferring that, then this is extremely limited, rudimentary, simplistic type of thinking.  Things are nowhere near that simple, and for anyone to think that I'm even implying this is quite silly actually.  Russia, NK, and China, of course,
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have their fair share of problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the number one biggest bully on the global block is indeed the US at this present point in history - this is a pure and simple fact - and, much as all other countries have their issues and problems as well, the problems that the US is being responsible for causing are for the most part the largest and most destructive of any other country on the planet at the present moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you want to call it "frightening indoctrination" when someone agrees with a presentation that points out the true extent to which the US is just as brainwashing of its citizens as North Korea?  Okay.
       <a href="http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/attach/4/6/9/8/0/SJ_Shoulder_Shrug_1264514233.jpg">
        Meh
       </a>
       .  I personally say it is you and anyone like you who is brainwashed if you think that it's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, again, showing that Russia, NK, China, etc, etc, are "no better than the US" doesn't make the extent to which the US is brainwashing of its citizens
       <em>
        any less the case
       </em>

       Well as far as foreign policy the US is worse then all these countries yes, but to say they're better at brainwashing their citizens or worse with internal policy is just a horrible lie. China, NK, and russia are actual totalitarian regimes, the US is a corrupt democracy sure, but it's not quite the dictatorship NK and china are, and at least has some regulation as far as human rights go. Where China and NK at least have almost none. Using these countries, that clearly have an agenda against america I.E. North Korea wanting to destroy the US. Is just a bad idea, they are not a good source of reliable information. The information they present is not true.

       US is more than merely a corrupt democracy.  It has become an all but putrid coporatocracy where the multinationals have almost total control of the government and the citizens.  It's just done covertly so the citizens are still under the blind and mistaken impression that they live in a "free country".  It's all bullshit.  The big difference between the US and places like China is that China walks up to you with bat in hand and swings for the fences right in front of your face.  The US covertly pays someone to beat your ass, and then comes to "save the day!" by offering you expensive medical services you can't afford but will live cripple if you don't shell out for them.

       I don't disagree with this assessment you made here.  I readily admit that a documentary like this one is, of course, slanted
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the West.  However, if even
       <em>
        five
       </em>
       percent of what is said in the doc is valid and true (and a LOT more than five percent of what is said in the doc is valid and true), then the doc is very much worth watching and learning from.

       Yes.  Correct.  It helps balance things a bit.  Not saying that this doc is "100% true and balanced".  Of course it's not.  It seems more valid than not to me, however.

        Funny though as true as alot of the stuff in that video is I can still at least watch the video and text about it and talk trash aboit my government, somehow I dont think your average North Korean can.

       I personally don't know if the reason why it seems to us that most people from NK don't talk bad about their government is because they get gulaged if they do, or if it's because they simply don't feel their government IS as bad as
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       personally think and have been indoctrinated to think it is.  Again.  I don't know.

       has a good point.  I'm not so sure that we in the West are anywhere as free as we think we are in terms of being able to talk shit about the government here.

       Just ask the man whose picture is to the right on the side panel here  (Michael Hastings: 1980-2013 - r.i.p.).
