    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>No the US is a mess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  That much is most certainly correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean the indoctrination where literally anything that attacks the US must be right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I can only assume you&#39;re referring to me in thinking that <em>I</em> personally think that &quot;anything that attacks the US must be right.&quot;  If you are thinking/inferring that, then this is extremely limited, rudimentary, simplistic type of thinking.  Things are nowhere near that simple, and for anyone to think that I&#39;m even implying this is quite silly actually.  Russia, NK, and China, of course, <em>do</em> have their fair share of problems.</p>

<p>However, the number one biggest bully on the global block is indeed the US at this present point in history - this is a pure and simple fact - and, much as all other countries have their issues and problems as well, the problems that the US is being responsible for causing are for the most part the largest and most destructive of any other country on the planet at the present moment.</p>

<p>So you want to call it &quot;frightening indoctrination&quot; when someone agrees with a presentation that points out the true extent to which the US is just as brainwashing of its citizens as North Korea?  Okay.  <a href="http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/attach/4/6/9/8/0/SJ_Shoulder_Shrug_1264514233.jpg">Meh</a>.  I personally say it is you and anyone like you who is brainwashed if you think that it&#39;s <em>not</em> the case.</p>

<p>And, again, showing that Russia, NK, China, etc, etc, are &quot;no better than the US&quot; doesn&#39;t make the extent to which the US is brainwashing of its citizens <em>any less the case</em>.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t quite understand that concept, do you?</p>

<p>Bad, <em>baaad</em> straw man fallacy there.  I never actually said anything like that.  I didn&#39;t say that the US is &quot;better at brainwashing their citizens&quot;.  WTF?  Come on, man.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>US is more than merely a corrupt democracy.  It has become an all but putrid coporatocracy where the multinationals have almost total control of the government and the citizens.  It&#39;s just done covertly so the citizens are still under the blind and mistaken impression that they live in a &quot;free country&quot;.  It&#39;s all bullshit.  The big difference between the US and places like China is that China walks up to you with bat in hand and swings for the fences right in front of your face.  The US covertly pays someone to beat your ass, and then comes to &quot;save the day!&quot; by offering you expensive medical services you can&#39;t afford but will live cripple if you don&#39;t shell out for them.</p>

<p>One fucks you through the front door.  The other fucks you through the back door.  Same difference.</p>

<p>See, that&#39;s the thing.  The information they present <em>is</em> actually true and pretty much spot on regardless of what their own agenda otherwise is.</p>

<p>If my enemy says &quot;You&#39;re an ugly male.&quot; I certainly can&#39;t get mad at him for calling me is a male, since - enemy or not - they&#39;re correct in saying that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  So you can go back to your comfortable, cozy, pig pen of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">cave</a>, right?  Can&#39;t have any of that inconvenient cognitive dissonance getting in the way of your &quot;blissful&quot; ignorance, right?  You&#39;ll be able to go right back to sleep then.</p>

<p>I wonder what you&#39;re even doing in a sub like this, period.  Go back to r/animals or wherever.</p>

<p>Yes.  Correct.  It helps balance things a bit.  Not saying that this doc is &quot;100% true and balanced&quot;.  Of course it&#39;s not.  It seems more valid than not to me, however.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t know if the reason why it seems to us that most people from NK don&#39;t talk bad about their government is because they get gulaged if they do, or if it&#39;s because they simply don&#39;t feel their government IS as bad as <em>we</em> personally think and have been indoctrinated to think it is.  Again.  I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/28rlx4/i_never_thought_id_agree_with_something_kim_jong/cie2vm4">low_la</a> has a good point.  I&#39;m not so sure that we in the West are anywhere as free as we think we are in terms of being able to talk shit about the government here.</p>

<p>Just ask the man whose picture is to the right on the side panel here  (Michael Hastings: 1980-2013 - r.i.p.).</p>
