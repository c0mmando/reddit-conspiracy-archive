<p>video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A1o1Egi20c">Witness testimony</a> -- hard to watch..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Five judges and 27 jury members from six countries including the USA, considered evidence on over 50,000 missing Canadian, US, Argentine and European children who were suspected victims of an international child sacrificial cult referred to as the Ninth Circle.</p>

<p>Two adolescent women claimed that Pope Francis raped them while participating in child sacrifices. Eight eyewitnesses confirmed the allegations according to evidence presented this week at a Brussels Common Law Court of Justice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evidence of a Catholic Jesuit Order document called the “Magisterial Privilege&quot; was presented in court by the Chief Prosecutor. The record dated Dec. 25 1967 was said to show that <strong>every new Pope was required to participate in Ninth Circle Satanic ritual sacrifices of newborn children, including drinking their blood</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Chief Prosecutor presented alleged links between the British, Dutch and Belgian royal families to disappearances of Mohawk children at Canada&#39;s Church of England&#39;s Brantford Ontario Indian residential school. In 2008 a child mass gravesite was discovered at the Mohawk School. An ITCCS dig by archeologists was shut down when remains of a small child was uncovered.</p>

<p>Since then over 30 child mass grave sites have been located at Indian residential schools across Canada. The Catholic and Anglican Churches, United Church of Canada, Canadian government and Crown of England have refused ITCCS&#39; repeated requests for excavation of the mass grave sites.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not surprised with how the Church operates anymore, I suspect the church&#39;s inner mechanization has always been more luciferian and peaganist/hedonistic. I&#39;ve heard free masonry is controlled by the Jesuit as a sub group under the Zionist controlled NWO, given the systematic abuses which occur in the Church and the strong will of it to protect pedophiles, these mass child graves simply add to a prevalent and reoccurring theme... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most certainly! spirituality is quite important, the idea alone that we are somehow connected to others is so critical. The current economy is consumerist and atheistic to train us to worship material possession and to strip the ideology of connection to other human beings, to enforce the dog eat dog world enima/matrix/facism, all of this is intentionally forced upon us to divide and conquer us as a society. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a researcher in pedophilia per say, but its worth investigating considering the Church&#39;s very length past with its whole host of evils with which its been evidenced to have engaged in. As horrible as this may seem Charlotte&#39;s experience is somewhat tame in comparison to the Church sponsored genocide and sanctioned experimentation of the Canadian Indigenous peoples, though there were other smaller Church&#39;s involved in that massacre. </p>

<p>Kevin Annett, don&#39;t think he was a Roman Catholic priest, but his insight into what occurred to the Canadian Aboriginals is key to understanding the abuse against them. The Tales about the residential schools are also nightmare class materials. </p>

<p>I was wondering, prior to leaving high school I had a Roman Catholic history teacher who talked about Pope John Pope II having an upside cross, and Ratzinger also using the supposed upside down cross Christ staff which is supposedly a symbol of Luciferianism, do you have any insight to this?</p>

<p>Just because terrible things aren&#39;t happening in your specific branch of Christianity doesn&#39;t mean that they aren&#39;t happening elsewhere - that&#39;s the only point I was trying to make.</p>

<p>You&#39;re completely right but the Vatican is a <em>huge</em> part of the problem and have done more harm to Christianity than good.  They&#39;ve completely corrupted the core teachings and are and have been involved in some very dark, very evil things throughout their history.</p>

<p>I hope you don&#39;t take this as me attacking Catholicism as a whole as that isn&#39;t and has never been my intention.  Most Catholics I know are kind, awesome people who are far more aware of what&#39;s going on in the world than most.  That&#39;s the main reason why I hate seeing them come to the defense of the Vatican as if it has their best interests at heart.</p>
