       That's a given but you don't get my question I think. I mean why did you not have ad block turned on all the time? I honestly see no reason to look at ads or experience the annoyance of them or popups.

       Intesesting.   Just days before the change, the Siffy channel ran an ad for a new science fiction show that was filled with negative comments on how crappy the channel had become, and the ad was pulled.   There's likely a connection there - not that one ad would do it, but that must have been the last straw.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't even find the post any more, it must have been completely deleted, but it was an ad for a show called Defiance and 99% of the responses were "I don't watch/have that channel because they stopped being scifi and started being reality shows and wrestling."   The remaining 1% were PR reps talking about how the channel is the best it has ever been and everybody should watch the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing us, if that ad
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       problematic for Siffy, they should have read the input.   The comments generally sounded like people
       <em>
        used to
       </em>
       like the channel until the execs decided to change it - even the name was changed so it wasn't "sci fi" any more, and if you're that dedicated to driving away your viewers, you shouldn't be upset when you succeed in doing so.

       Haven't watched - I cancelled the channel because they decided to stop being sci fi and started being a reality-show &amp; wrestling channel, and even changed the name to prove it.  That was the gist of the post that I reference overall response; it seems like Sci Fi had a dedicated and interested audience but threw it away to try and be more generic, and now that they lost those viewers they're trying to get them back while remaining generic.  If the ad had enough impact to get pulled, I hope someone at the network forwards that criticism to whoever can improve things; science fiction as a genre is rising in popularity and
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       something to be avoided or hidden, and they already had the formula for success:   Science fiction.   SG-1 was awesome, Galactica had its issues later on but was great in the early running...   wrestling and reality TV, on the other hand, isn't what people subscribe to a Sci Fi channel for.

       Karma on whoaverse is calculated dynamically based on post and comment history. I would have to import all comments and posts linked to that account as well. So no, unfortunately import of karma count is not possible for now.

       Ask for some help - I saw quite a few devs in the main thread about this subject yesterday talking about starting a "new reddit".  I'm sure you would be able to find people who could lend a hand - the only issue would be properly vetting them and making sure no one is trying to take advantage or has nefarious motives.

       I will gladly accept any help! I simply can't do everything alone and I don't want the site to be solely dependent on me. I was thinking about registering a non-profit foundation (like Wikipedia) which would provide even more transparency and allow more people to get involved, but I would need some help for this too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any ideas where I might ask for help?

       <a href="/r/redditalternatives">
        /r/redditalternatives

       and maybe something on this sub as well - I'm sure that there are many people who would be happy and excited to help out.  Maybe try making a post on whoaverse, too - I'm sure that people who are over there checking it out would be interested in lending any help they could.  I wish I had dev skills of my own to contribute but I'd be happy to help in any way that I can too.

       Thank you. I guess the best way for the word to get out is by word of mouth, so I can leave that to the people. I do need help with administrative side too. More devs would be great, but other help is apprecaited too. I need moderators for default subs, I need help setting up a foundation (to make whoaverse US based non-profit) etc. And most of all, I need to not be the only person behind whoaverse, so that I can finally start saying WE.

       I hope that you're able to find other people as excited about this idea as I am who can help you with development/design.  I'm not sure what help I can offer but I'll do my best to get the word out, at the very least.

       If the advertisers had that as a problem, they could remove voting for those posts as clear indication they are ads, other than the sponsored post note. I think it's more about the AMAs for celebrities and their egos that can't handle criticism.

       A score of 0 with negative comments will give the payee the idea advertising here was a bad idea.

       I'm talking about the sponsored links, there's no such thing as hitting the front page, they're the blue links on the top of the front page, guaranteed a spot there.

      <p>
       It won't receive a score of 0, it appears there isn't a score to sponsored links anymore. People won't see the downvoting going on in the link and are less likely to also downvote, and probably less likely to comment negatively too. Before that lots of people just jumped on disliked ads that they knew were disliked because of RES and added to the negativity.

       As with any major admin decision, there will have been several different "benefits" which together made the case for pushing through this change, and this reason certainly sounds like one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason was probably to counter the obvious brigading problem that reddit has. The "invisible downvote wheeze" makes this issue go away, not by solving the problem but by hiding it.

       And in fact makes it far easier to bury threads/comments without many people noticing.  I think a lot of people in the main subs had been catching up to the obvious voting manipulation that goes on all over this site and reddit, inc. didn't like it.
