    <div class="md"><p>Intesesting.   Just days before the change, the Siffy channel ran an ad for a new science fiction show that was filled with negative comments on how crappy the channel had become, and the ad was pulled.   There&#39;s likely a connection there - not that one ad would do it, but that must have been the last straw.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t even find the post any more, it must have been completely deleted, but it was an ad for a show called Defiance and 99% of the responses were &quot;I don&#39;t watch/have that channel because they stopped being scifi and started being reality shows and wrestling.&quot;   The remaining 1% were PR reps talking about how the channel is the best it has ever been and everybody should watch the show.</p>

<p>The thing us, if that ad <em>was</em> problematic for Siffy, they should have read the input.   The comments generally sounded like people <em>used to</em> like the channel until the execs decided to change it - even the name was changed so it wasn&#39;t &quot;sci fi&quot; any more, and if you&#39;re that dedicated to driving away your viewers, you shouldn&#39;t be upset when you succeed in doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t watched - I cancelled the channel because they decided to stop being sci fi and started being a reality-show &amp; wrestling channel, and even changed the name to prove it.  That was the gist of the post that I reference overall response; it seems like Sci Fi had a dedicated and interested audience but threw it away to try and be more generic, and now that they lost those viewers they&#39;re trying to get them back while remaining generic.  If the ad had enough impact to get pulled, I hope someone at the network forwards that criticism to whoever can improve things; science fiction as a genre is rising in popularity and <em>isn&#39;t</em> something to be avoided or hidden, and they already had the formula for success:   Science fiction.   SG-1 was awesome, Galactica had its issues later on but was great in the early running...   wrestling and reality TV, on the other hand, isn&#39;t what people subscribe to a Sci Fi channel for.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the sponsored links, there&#39;s no such thing as hitting the front page, they&#39;re the blue links on the top of the front page, guaranteed a spot there.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But if a thread receives a score of 0 and the comments are largely negative, what&#39;s the difference?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It won&#39;t receive a score of 0, it appears there isn&#39;t a score to sponsored links anymore. People won&#39;t see the downvoting going on in the link and are less likely to also downvote, and probably less likely to comment negatively too. Before that lots of people just jumped on disliked ads that they knew were disliked because of RES and added to the negativity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been waiting for the day when Reddit starts trying to take it&#39;s chips down.  It&#39;s way too popular not to be tuning a profit.  </p>

<p>We don&#39;t really need vote counts in subreddits like this anyway, but it&#39;s going to fuck up the larger subreddits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with any major admin decision, there will have been several different &quot;benefits&quot; which together made the case for pushing through this change, and this reason certainly sounds like one of them.</p>

<p>Another reason was probably to counter the obvious brigading problem that reddit has. The &quot;invisible downvote wheeze&quot; makes this issue go away, not by solving the problem but by hiding it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And in fact makes it far easier to bury threads/comments without many people noticing.  I think a lot of people in the main subs had been catching up to the obvious voting manipulation that goes on all over this site and reddit, inc. didn&#39;t like it.</p>

<p>I see potential here. Is there a way to import reddit usernames and karma count?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, thanks for that. I signed up today. I find it pretty grand even in it&#39;s infancy. What are the risks of being banned or censored over there now? Are there rules? Or is it just the wild west in there right now?</p>
