       You know I always dismissed posts claiming reddit is turning to shit, we should go elsewhere, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I always thought, if each of us puts the effort into upvoting and downvoting and commenting, we can create the community we want.
      </p>
      <p>
       This new downvote fuzzing bullshit, in my opinion is the last straw. Reddit is no longer viable in my mind, where do I go now?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I will still comment and upvote but it seems we have lost this one people.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit2: tried to find one comment saying something, anything, positive about the new change in the thread that announced it. I could not find one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bought a domain, though, that is the first step, now I have to figure out everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit3: I have been browsing
       <a href="http://whoaverse.com">
        http://whoaverse.com
       </a>
       that
       <a href="/u/fenixrisin">
        /u/fenixrisin
       </a>
       suggested. It has many kinks in it to be remedied, though I am down to start anew and get a couple years, if not more, of quality discourse than the rubbish we have gotten to. Check it out if interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit4: Thank you all for your comments, I greatly appreciate them. I will still visit reddit but over time that will probably dwindle down until I stop entirely. I have been here for two years and its been great while it lasted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit5: Figured this was worth posting:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now that Reddit is losing its transparency, I will slowly be moving on to another site, i.e, posting all my links to whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy ...and splitting my time between here and there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just figured that it's best to start building the content on the other site now that Reddit has obviously decided to go the way of google, turn to the dark side.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am making this same post to the subReddit that I am most active on just in case others are looking for alternative.
       </p>
       <p>
        As far as disclaimers go, there are none. I am just a user and not affiliated to the other site.

       You don't go anywhere because they already own it, too.  And if they don't they will just buy it with a tiny fraction of their trillions of dollars.  You see, that is what you are actually living in.  A system where a few handfuls of families own enough wealth to buy every good new technology so they can control it and turn it against the people.

       I'd still lurk here until a distributed micro blog comes out.  It would need to work something like between Bittorrent, Bitcoin, Twitter and Tox.  Probably messages would be limited to a something short but maybe not as short as Twitter.  There would be various issues to overcome like how to deal with spam and who has the right to post and for quite some time it would only be able to attract technical users.

       Is the Reddit codebase not sharable?  Could a branch be started from a non-Reddit.com domain?  I know not of the copyright and legal ramifications, but the code appears relatively open.  Similar to Wikipedia code?

       That is where the crypto currency algorithms come in. They can define work and credit in a variety of ways.  So without spending two years working on the project and off of the top of my head I would say that upvotes could be defined as work credit to allow posting.  The problem though is that there would be nothing stopping people from simply making a lot of accounts to upvote each other.  The main trick would be to prevent a runaway botnet.  If people could run their own fiefdoms from within the system then that could solve a lot of issues right there as likely there would need to be a starting point of trust to set things in the right direction.  I think that this problem is overall an order of magnitude more complicated because it would need to borrow from all of the latest innovations.

       I think you are right. But I also think any system has to allow bots and spammers to use it, but just make it easy to see who is doing what.

       you are, dare I say it, mentally overboard
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit originally offered its source code free of charge for other sites to be created and exist
      </p>
      <p>
       the audience refused to leave because of laziness and complacency
      </p>
      <p>
       this is not the fault of the elite power base, this is the fault of the audience for not taking action
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit was hated among the internets for a strange and text heavy interface when Digg was the big boy but Digg sold out for moneyz and all but the most mental came here (Check the forum posts from digg submissions, I dont even believe that those people even have a human brain, i sound cocky but its true)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, go and make an alternative. Noone is doing it because the only alternatives for conspiracy related forums are 1) Anti-semitic sites like stormfront, etc 2) Sites that dont allow alternative and creative thought processes ie: If you go against the grain of hive-mind thought, you are banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one good thing about
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is the mods lack of full control over every detail allowing us to supply various alternative thoughts. It is more liberal than other sites too despite the so called shill infestation. For example, a mod here starting with "S" is a transvestite cross dresser which is awesome except for the anti-jewish fervor in her posts which is a shame since I am german and jewish and can see through a lot of the stuff going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of interesting things happening on conspiracy every day internally, externally, and from the audience which is why it is so fascinating.

       for the most part I agree, apathy is truly our greatest enemy.

       I would wager that the next real forum for open thought will be on some kind of meshnet, whatever form it may take.

      <p>
       anything else will be corrupted eventually, because the network itself is corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why we need to stop faffing about and begging our masters for that wolf in sheeps clothing, "net neutrality", and we need to stop crying when a corporate owned site like reddit inevitably is subverted to support the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead we should focus on building real alternatives, the possibilities for this are multiplying fast.

       We have our porn, and our netflix, and amazon. Sometimes I fear that this is all that people want, and all this outrage is simply because Orange is the new fucking Black is buffering too long.

       then I look around a bit and I see amazing people doing amazing fucking work the world over, people that truly understand the predicament we are in.

       Not a bad idea. You'd have to take that up with the other mods. Though I'm not sure they'd feel compelled or motivated to do so. There's already a similar alternative in place, whoaverse, with a limited userbase and the predicament of having to start fresh. Then you have the matter of the nearly quarter of a million users we have here already. While I do not like this latest development to say the least, for various reasons, it isn't necessarily the worst we've seen so far. That accomplishment would be the fact the site has become inundated with shills/special interest advocates, corporate and government alike, who use their clout to influence and censor the larger subs (conspiracy aside), a minority of which organize brigades and attacks against our own. Well them, and there useful idiots of course, of which there is no shortage in sight.

      <p>
       Perhaps. One way to look at it, is if we simply give up and leave the sub or site as a whole, rather than standing up for we believe in, then it is essentially mission accomplished for those who have positioned themselves against us.

       On the other hand, as mentioned prior, if we simply give up and leave over something as minor (though incredibly shady) as this, and allow those who troll and brigade our sub to take over, we are essentially handing them an even greater victory, and abandoning all other users here  in the process, those dedicated enough to not give up so easily.

       Shut down the subreddit if necessary, better than letting it turn into an astroturfed parody of itself. We already saw disinfo and other posts designed to discredit us getting suspicious amounts of upvotes. Back when we could still see the votes.

       I think we're too far gone for reddit as a whole quantum... Don't get me wrong r/conspiracy is the last to be conquered it seems and we may be able to defend this place but I am not so sure it worth saving at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love this community and I love our mod team and think they have been doing phenomenal considering the constant uphill battle we fight.

       Possibly. As I just mentioned prior:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The mod team could create/endorse a new website utilizing the basic reddit code?
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Not a bad idea. You'd have to take that up with the other mods. Though I'm not sure they'd feel compelled or motivated to do so. There's already a similar alternative in place, whoaverse, with a limited userbase and the predicament of having to start fresh. Then you have the matter of the nearly quarter of a million users we have here already. While I do not like this latest development to say the least, for various reasons, it isn't necessarily the worst we've seen so far. That accomplishment would be the fact the site has become inundated with shills/special interest advocates, corporate and government alike, who use their clout to influence and censor the larger subs (conspiracy aside), a minority of which organize brigades and attacks against our own. Well them, and there useful idiots of course, of which there is no shortage in sight.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I am already feeling uncomfortable browsing this sub, flying blind as it were, without the upvote/downvote information that I've come to rely upon in the past year.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        I know what you mean. Then again, I'm more concerned with the aforementioned problems at the moment.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Maybe what's left of our community can be salvaged in some way, but even rats know when to flee a sinking ship.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Perhaps. One way to look at it, is if we simply give up and leave the sub or site as a whole, rather than standing up for we believe in, then it is essentially mission accomplished for those who have positioned themselves against us.
       </p>

       I'm not sure. I haven't had to approve others who have submitted successfully. The site might be experiencing a sudden peak in traffic.

       I am not familiar with moderating, and don't plan on doing much of it. I created that a month or so ago when I saw the 'writing on the wall' in this forum.

       Once we get a few hundred regulars over there I'll cut all ties with this place.

       Lost in all this nonsense is the power we have when we come together. By collaborating in our efforts to find the 'truth' we devote a copious amount of energy and resources. If we worked together, collaborate, we can achieve the unimaginable. If we allow ourselves, and our public forums, to be divided, that is how we will remain.

       The more I've looked at it, it seems that subscriptions just aren't a feature on the site yet.  It's apparently only one person who created and is running the entire site so it makes sense that it's a work in progress - that's a huge undertaking for one person to work on by themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I knew more about developing/designing a website so I could help in a more concrete way.  For now, I think the best I can do is try to get the word out and attract more people which will hopefully lead to what you're saying - a mass of like-minded people coming together and creating something great.

       Whoaverse can't display a list of subscribed forums.

       Hi! I am currently the only developer of whoaverse and I never actually expected that this many people would be using it. Whoaverse was more of a side project to me, heavily inspired by all the mistakes reddit keeps making (forced default subs and now downvote change). There is currently no private messaging system and no subscriptions, but these are top priorities among other issues that need fixing/implementing. For a full list check here:
       <a href="https://github.com/whoaverse/whoaverse/issues?state=open">
        https://github.com/whoaverse/whoaverse/issues?state=open
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Could whoaverse replace reddit? In current state, hell no. Being a poor student, I could in no way afford to pay for the servers needed to run this on such a large scale, but there is a chance that whoaverse becomes a foundation (like Wikipedia) if enough people are interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, the only better thing whoaverse offers is genuine account deletion feature which actually deletes all data you left on whoaverse if you ever decide to delete your account. Unlike reddit where all your comments and posts remain intact, whoaverse actually overwrites every comment and post with "deleted" if you delete your account and then proceeds to remove your username and encrypted password from the database.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoaverse is in very early alpha so I suggest you don't move to whoaverse unless you can handle some downtime, bugs or missing features :)

       we need a replacement/improvement to reddit. here's what i've been thinking about it:
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the community should be pay to participate. Not a large amount, a one-time charge of a dollar or two should be enough to get the desired effect. The idea is to make it fairly painless to join the community and participate, but prohibitive to exert influence through bots and the like. Being banned would actually matter. Users buying accounts would require that moderation would have to be fair and transparent, necessary to a thriving online community in any case. For users that require anonymity, bitcoin could be an option. I think this would encourage a community of thoughtful participation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could have the community democratically decide on a few different worthy causes, and then members could choose which one they wanted their money to go to when they signed up. Relatedly, the same process could be applied to any ad revenue the community generated(beyond what was required to pay for hosting/bandwidth). I think this would have a few knock-on benefits, the first being that people would be encourage to use the community more, as they would be aware that their ad-impressions were paying for solar water desalinators in africa or cancer research or whatever, which should make people feel less guilty for redditing the day away. Secondly, by making the community a philanthropic instead of for-profit enterprise, you remove the monetary incentive for corruption. (On the organization side, at least. People looking to drive traffic will still have plenty of incentive to do so.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, and most nebulously, I think that making philanthropy a part of the bedrock of the community would really help to foster a culture that feels empowered to effect positive change in the world. To my mind, the aspect of reddit that I find most unpleasant is the constant defeatism and apathy. While I would love to be a member of content aggregation/discussion community that made the world a better place just through its use as an entertainment outlet, what I really hunger for is a community and platform that could come up with some novel means of improving our collective lives.

       You just described SomethingAwful. That's where I ended up a few years ago when the decline started. I still stop in here from time to time, but when you might have to pay 10 dollars to get your account unbanned every time you post, you actually think about what you say.

       Oh yeah, oops. The first time I posted this I clarified that I was thinking something like the SA forums(but built on transparent accountable moderation, and effecting change.). I've been on the SA forums forever, and think that the synthesis between the and something like reddit is where we should be going.

       You think the timing is a coincidence?  We say no to ___ when they demand we go into Iran, and then again when they demand we go into Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now suddenly we're being told that Iran and Syria are about to go into Iraq.  Are you looking at any of this coverage btw?  It's the run-up to Gulf War II all over again.

       And oh look, ___ is getting shut out of power in Washington now, witness Cantor's wipeout.

       I like the new change. If you say what you believe in, who cares what your downvote/upvote ratio is. You can still have the exact same discussions as before, and the content of your discussions is what you should be putting importance on.

       Obviously having the content manipulated by anything other than the users is bad. Can't we just browse "new" and not have to worry about it? As long as it doesn't break any rules, we'd see it in "new".

       I like it because sometimes I put far too much emphasis on how many downvotes I get in relation to upvotes. A few times, I have made comments that got tons of downvotes because everyone thought I was wrong, but later more info came out and I turned out to be correct. In the end, I've come to realize downvote/upvote ratios mean nothing, and it's the content of your comments which is important. And nothing has changed in regards to what kind of content you can submit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        we are being controlled by an invisible hand.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I see no reason to believe anything has changed in terms of what content people upvote/downvote. Content is subject to the exact same influences they were before the change. People will continue upvoting, and people will continue downvoting. What reason do you have to think that there is now some manipulation going on that wasn't before?

       When you're on the ideological fringes like we are, downvotes are par for the course. just seeing that I got 10 upvotes and 15 downvotes on a comment instead of zero upvotes and 5 downvotes means a lot to me, personally. Without this feedback, this ridiculous change will only further discourage people from voicing unpopular opinions.
