I used to be consistently downvoted in certain subreddits and would have 10 minute time limits in between every post until I worked my way back up to positive karma there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit. That&#39;s the whole point of the voting and comment system in the first place. If you are on a sub like <a href="/r/MechanicAdvice">/r/MechanicAdvice</a>, surrounded by other people who are knowledgeable on the subject, trolls and ridiculous answers would (or at least, should) get downvoted into oblivion. The new system does nothing to curb trolling and actually <em>protects</em> trolls and bots by hiding downvotes so people don&#39;t know when a submission has been highly contested. If you thought reddit was dead before, the new policy change has put the nail in the coffin for good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most obvious was how r/technology had a &quot;dispute&quot; which resulted in all the stories being buried while the remove net neutrality bill was going through. </p>

<p>Then not even a week later, reddit admins pick a new 50 default subreddit leaving out r/technology losing it&#39;s unregistered viewers which is the vast majority. </p>

<p>However honestly, reddit was hijacked several years ago when there were major mod disputes on most of the default sub reddits. Then not long after they removed r/politics from the defaults. </p>

<p>I think it has something to do with the number of downvotes your comments get. If you get a certain number of downvotes within a given time period, you get comment-rated, or something like that. For example, I have a -77 comment rating for <a href="/r/Economics">/r/Economics</a> and I constantly have to deal with that 10 minute waiting period.</p>

<p>You can just set up a new email and verify that if you don&#39;t want reddit linking to your actual email, btw. It takes like 30 seconds on gmail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few ways to get the restriction. One is to be a new account, in which it acts as a probationary period. The second is to be consistently downvoted in a certain subreddit or having a single post with a large amount of negative karma.</p>

<p>What <a href="/u/Ketomaa">/u/Ketomaa</a> is saying is absolutely correct. There could be other reasons (maybe mods or admins can manually impose it?) but the two I mentioned are the most common.</p>
