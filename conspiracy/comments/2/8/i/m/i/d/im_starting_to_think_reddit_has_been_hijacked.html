       Have you seen the movie "the Corporation"? It was made in the 90s but resonates today. 3 hours: One of the best Documentaries Ever. IMHO. Corporate infiltration and espionage is more in depth and subtle than most people expect. Lots of stuff i see on the front page appears to be "product placement" For a while I thought i was seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger on the front page, and THAT made me go "hmmmmm....."

       I just noticed the no down vote thing..The "time thing" had been normal on certain subs, but all of the sudden started on r/mechanicadvise a day or 2 ago.. The shit is getting ready to hit the fan. Maybe they are clamping down.. I have been brigaded by communists rhetoric comments lately on this sub.

       If you're getting brigaded as you claim, you'll get a post limit on subreddits where downvotes are consistently accrued. It's a way to incentivize making quality posts (aka conforming to the majority), but that stuff has been around for as long as I've been here. I used to be consistently downvoted in certain subreddits and would have 10 minute time limits in between every post until I worked my way back up to positive karma there.

       Same here!  I got brigaded by a group of extremist ideological communists that seemed like freshman college 4chan trolls.  I thought like that for a few months in college, but they were organized and brigading, were incredibly vicious, militant, unreasonable, stupid and pretentious - immune to even acknowledging history or partaking in any form of intellectually honest discussion.  They were religiously ideological and blinded by their passion, and I've been left-leaning my entire life.

       Yeah limits to discussions are extremely contrary to the original nature that was reddit. I was recently banned from a subreddit for giving my opinion in a thread from the mods asking for opinions and input on new rules.... I really think people are going to start to flock away from this site because it has some serious problems now.

       Bullshit. That's the whole point of the voting and comment system in the first place. If you are on a sub like
       <a href="/r/MechanicAdvice">
        /r/MechanicAdvice
       </a>
       , surrounded by other people who are knowledgeable on the subject, trolls and ridiculous answers would (or at least, should) get downvoted into oblivion. The new system does nothing to curb trolling and actually
       <em>
        protects
       </em>
       trolls and bots by hiding downvotes so people don't know when a submission has been highly contested. If you thought reddit was dead before, the new policy change has put the nail in the coffin for good.

       I think the most obvious was how r/technology had a "dispute" which resulted in all the stories being buried while the remove net neutrality bill was going through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then not even a week later, reddit admins pick a new 50 default subreddit leaving out r/technology losing it's unregistered viewers which is the vast majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       However honestly, reddit was hijacked several years ago when there were major mod disputes on most of the default sub reddits. Then not long after they removed r/politics from the defaults.

       I think it has something to do with the number of downvotes your comments get. If you get a certain number of downvotes within a given time period, you get comment-rated, or something like that. For example, I have a -77 comment rating for
       <a href="/r/Economics">
        /r/Economics
       </a>
       and I constantly have to deal with that 10 minute waiting period.

       I'm pretty sure it's true. I kept having to wait 10 minutes in between comments then realized it told me in the meantime I could verify my email. Once I verified it, I had zero troubles with the 10 minute thing.

       You can just set up a new email and verify that if you don't want reddit linking to your actual email, btw. It takes like 30 seconds on gmail.

       In that case I don't know, I had this account with -50~ karma and it could only submit one post each 7 minutes than it got to -70~ and the limiter became 10 minutes on all subreddits by the way.

       There are a few ways to get the restriction. One is to be a new account, in which it acts as a probationary period. The second is to be consistently downvoted in a certain subreddit or having a single post with a large amount of negative karma.

       What
       <a href="/u/Ketomaa">
        /u/Ketomaa

       is saying is absolutely correct. There could be other reasons (maybe mods or admins can manually impose it?) but the two I mentioned are the most common.

       I just got 5 upvotes on a post that 85% liked apparently, no upvotes added to total. Not that care that much or I'd post popularist crap in the first place.

       I've been having a fun time on this site and others. It's not just reddit. I had my facebook profile disabled for days without reason or communication. They hate me because I post only funny obscure youtube videos and post false information about myself and don't use a real name. I'm not surveillance friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods on this site are ridiculous. I was banned from a sub for questioning EULAs.
