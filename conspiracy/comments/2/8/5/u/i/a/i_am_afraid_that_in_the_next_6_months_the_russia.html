       The Chinese military has increased their military budget by over 500% in the last few years. It has also very successfully acquired (through Spies and Hacking) an insane amount of US Defense Technology. It can track any of our planes, ships and subs now and can probably disable our Electric/Internet/Communications grids both Civilian and Military at will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Factor in the sheer size of the Chinese and Russian Military Complex (over 1 Billion people total) and we do not stand a fucking chance. The entirety of the US Military is under 300,000 people and 2/3 rds of them are currently outside the US Border.

       In the Revolution, nations like Russia and France helped Washington and the Founders throw out the British crown and its banking goons. History will hopefully repeat itself and Russia will be an instrumental ally in assisting with the restoration of America's Constitutional Republic and the overthrow of the banker goons who have assumed the powers of government.

       I imagine a revolutionary movement in the US to restore the Constitutional Republic needing some foreign assistance just as the Founding Fathers had help from Russia and France. Russia was a key ally during the Revolution and the Civil War versus the British robber barons. Our modern plight is the same.

       Russia and China don't WANT the US.  They're not going to conquer us for land.  They may want to destabilize the government and economic system, but they would hardly need to invade to do that.  You should try Xanax to ease the paranoia.

       Not paranoid, might be wrong (hopefully) but definitely not paranoid. Having said that, China and Russia own over half of US Debt. China has setup/bought thousands of businesses and manufacturing plants in the USA in the last few years. There are more Chinese and Russian born citizens living inside the United States today than all other countries (except their home countries) combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now factor in the fact that Russia and China are both running dry on oil and the United States has untold (and as yet undiscovered) wealth of Oil. The United States also has one of only a few working Uranium mines in the world. We also have vast amounts of Plutonium and other rare metals that are scarce in other parts of the world.

       Canada has oil. Canada has A LOT of oil. Fracking produces natural gas, which is good for heating, but not good for lubrication. Texas has oil as well, but I am quite certain Alberta has more.

       Once again, Canada has high grade Uranium. An enormous amount of it.  "Most uranium ore in the United States comes from deposits in sandstone, which tend to be of lower grade than those of Australia and Canada"

      <p>
       <strong>
        IF Russia or China was thinking about invading to gain natural resources...
       </strong>
       , they should invade Northern Canada, most specifically, Alberta. Leave most of Canada and USA alone, and annex Alaska, BC, Yukon, NorthWest Terrotories, and Alberta, then stop.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       This will likely NEVER occur. Why? Because Canada already has the infrastructure set up to extract it and they export 99% of it. It is sold at "market price" which means that as soon as it becomes economical to extract, it will be extracted. Canada is a developed nation, which means they can do things as economically as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea where to begin calculations on whether or not it is economical for China or Russia to invade Canada, (rebuild all the infrastructure, and train new employees to do the work). However, I am very confident it is not. Canada already uses the BEST methods to get the stuff, and sells at a slight margin.

        Much easier, would be for the Chinees or Russian governments to purchase a majourity stake in the mining companies.

       You have a point that Canada would be a better (resource) target than the USA, but Canada is also better liked in the world (more friends/allies), it is more civilized and extremely heavily armed with the vast majority of their forces AT HOME in Canada.

       Yes, almost the entire world is Canada's Ally. Usually, when canada goes to war, they play a support role. US soldiers drive the tanks, and Canadians repair them.

       They don't need to. The plan to destabilize the petro-dollar started about a week ago. A military with no funding, that will be used to control domestic insurrection after the economic collapse doesn't pose a large threat to either regime.

       As a Canadian, I can honestly tell you this will not go down. Why would we possibly want those states? Whereas Canadians and Americans share much in common, there are lots of things Canadians take for granted that just wouldn't make sense to our cousins to the south, like socialized health care. Even If the US does end up breaking up into pieces, I doubt any American would actually be ok switching to Canada's Parliamentary Monarchy system of government.

       I can see the West Coast going to China, I can see Alaska going to Russia (again) and Hawaii going to China or Japan.....but I think the south with become Texas instead of Mexico. I think the North Central will become its own country and I think the East Coast will rename to the United States Republic or something similar.

       There are over 7 billion people in China and almost 1 billion currently enrolled in the Military. Add in the living former military and that numbers swells to almost 3 billion potential troops for a USA invasion. They would out number us 2,500 to 1.

       I have seen you quote numbers earlier in the thread but bit my tongue because maybe you meant million instead of billion. But, as this is a repeated quotation of chinas population to be in the several
       <strong>
        <em>
         B
        </em>
       </strong>
       illions, i have to say something.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of 2014, China's population was around 1.35 Billion. Thats less than one and a half billion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you have mistaken the entire wotlds population (which back in 2013 was estimated to be around 7.169 Billion people) for chinas? I dunno. I dont wanna be a dick but i couldnt not say something this time, as this isnt the only thing youve misquoted in this thread (mainly population and number misquotations, and for the record, chinas military, inckuding reserves, is around four million, americas alittle over two million, and russias is alittle over three million. So, that puts russia and china tovether at roughly seven million, to americas three. For an invasion to be successful, we gotta also look at the invaded country's of age/fit for service population. For america, its about 120 million folks. Plus nonfit folks with a bunch of guns (old people have guns too). Point is, they would, no doubt, have a very tough time invading us, even working together, at least in any conventional sense.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I do like youre perspectives, though, so im not trying to offend you. Your view made me reflect back on the emp threats and whatnot, which would give them quite an advantage if you ignore the numbers game. Now, if they were to use nonconventional methods for invasion, for instance, in order to match or better our fighting numbers, they would have to forcefully conscript around one tenth of their ENTIRE chinese population. This doesnt seem to be a feasible notion as far as im concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point if this is, i believe with my whole heart that russia and china are not going to team up together to pull off a "Red Dawn" type of invasion. I dont see it. It would involve way too much effort, it would be a very arduous and tough undertaking, and their return on investment would be very shitty considering the global backlash and economical black hole they would be creating for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not feasible.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is more likely, imo, is a type of war weve never seen before. Economical warfare:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        the destruction of the dollar through local asset acquisition (like china buying a bunch if shit over their in detroit and stuff),
       </li>
       <li>
        debt (which china holds 8% of our total debt and russia holds less, whereas the federal reserve holds about 12% and another 6% are in mutual funds, arguably making international bankers the largest holders of our debt at around 18% of the total)
       </li>
       <li>
        competition (by establishing the cheapest manufacturing, or close to it, in order to undermine our manufacturing process and thereford hurting our economy. Trade treaties further this agenda).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Once we are hurting economically, we will begin to turn on ourselves. Desperate people do desperate things during desperate times. We will be hungry, angry, scared, confused. With a lack of an obvious foreign aggressor, we will begin to create enemies within and of our neighbors. One of two things happen at this point, both in favor of russia and chinas "agenda"
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         first. Seeing the commotion and the barbaric results of economic collapse, our military and our DHS and various other armed abc agencies will begin to realize they need to "protect their assets" and establish martial law, emergency dictatorship, whatever, you get the point. This weakens our defense as our muzzles turn into our borders, btw. If russia and china want to invade, THIS is when they will do it, possibly blaming america with a false flag (like what we were gonna do to cuba a few decades ago) type event for justification.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         second, the economic collapse hurts the trust we have in our government, and we begin to blame them for (criminal) inaction/neglect due to a lack of a clear outside aggressor. We create an enemy out of out own state, and declare war upon our own government. Now, russia and china can wait for us to kill ourselves and call mission successfully completed; they can play proxy war and support us rebels and then take over once were weak enough; they can "loan" us support as a loan shark loans money to a needy gambler, with a contigency that if we win, yada yada yada and then they wouldnt have to lose so  many of their men or assets and get to enslave us for the foreseeable future all at the same time. Huge return on investment, if you ask me.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Thats how i see it going down. It makes more sense when you consider greedy people do complex things for one thing, greed. Lust for power, wealth--greed. And, the greediest people who are also incredibly successful, understand that the best investments have the highest returns for the lowest capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, i conclude that nuclear first strike or red dawn type invasion or even an aggressive EMP first strike (though, the emp would return more than nuclear strike or all out invading) wouldnt be the optimal course of action. These scenarios dont offer russia and china the highest return, and will no doubt create many problems for them, some of which cannot be predicted or foreseen. They would instead opt for the course of action that woukd guarantee them the highest return, off them plausible deniability to protect their credibility within the global community, and allow them to use the lowest amount of men and the least amount of moneys and other assets as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is, of course, assuming the internationak bankers who collectively own 18% of our debt and russia and china arent colluding. This is also only reffering to americas "public" debt, which the total is over $17 trillion now. But, this is also not including our liabilities, which can sting us just as hard as the public debt, and considering the estimates, could be unfathomably painful to deal with. Basically, our total revenue versus our total financial obligations nets us around $220 trillion in the hole, some reports say. Ive done a littke diggin, and no one seems to agree on the exact amount, anywhere between well over $30T to over $200T, depending on what you consider "debt" and "liabilities" and other bullshit terms. What everyone does agree to is our true debt/obligations is well over the $17.5T they commonly quote. Why do i bring this up? Well, it makes me wonder where the other ends of the obligations are. I wanna know how obligated we are to china when we start to consider unfunded liabikites, securities, and all the stufc no one understands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Final point, the majority of my proposed theory considers a ridiculously conservative point of view, and in reality, there are many more variables ajd even more possibke outcomes and motives that we cant possibly say what will happen. we can only make certain that we obtain knowledge of how to provide for ourselves and our own families while relying only on ourselves and nothing else.

       Nuclear first strike maybe; certainly eventually, if things keep on the way they are. But the US is too big to occupy, even for the Shanghai Cooperative; just Texas alone is too big. No invasion of the kind you are thinking of is possible at this time. After the US has been nuked, they will invade the parts that are still good for sure though.

       Invade?  Not a chance.  Some sort of strike is possible, although unlikely, but an actual invasion is so unlikely that it is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that in order to invade, they would have to get the coast.  How would they do it?  Ships?  The US's navy is far superior and larger than anything Russia or China can muster.  By air?  Again, our Airforce is second to non, and they would have to land safely somewhere.  Also, consider that it wouldn't just be the US, Canada, the EU, Australia, Japan, etc. would all come to our aid.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, they may have tons of people, but they don't have a reliable means of getting those people to our shores.

       You are joking right....
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes we have a massive Navy but almost all of our ships (West Coast Ships) aren't in the USA right now. Additionally, there are over a dozen former military bases in California, Oregon, Washington that are sitting empty and unsecured they could land their planes on. Third the US west cost is the least secured section of our country. Most of the bases have been closed or scaled back and the vast majority of the troops stationed there are not currently in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a quick search for "China Military" on Google will reveal that they have built hundreds of Ships and Thousands of Fighters in the last couple years.....and that's just what they want us to know about.

       No, I'm not joking.  The ships might not be there right now, but we would see them coming, since an invasion fleet would be large.  Our ships could easily move to intercept, along with our allies before they could even see our coast.
      </p>
      <p>
       You recognize that many of our troops are over seas, but seem to fail to see the implication of that.  Most of them are near either Russia or China.  Any move to invade our homeland would not be received well by those well armed an equipped troops all of the world, not just our troops either, but those of our allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could things change in the next 20 years or so?  Sure.  But within the next 6 months like you think?  Not a chance.

       You are correct, I did fail to account for the fact that a large number of our troops are near Russia and China and theoretically if they attempt to invade us we could turn around and invade them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless of course they have someway of disabling our (and our allies) ships, weapons and communications before they launched an attack on us.

       Your concerns aren't unfounded. I don't think the media is touching this, which makes it all the more frightening.

       Exactly, Russia has repeatedly tried to fly their Long Range Nuclear-Capable bombers into the USA over the last few weeks. We have detected and intercepted them several times.....makes me wonder how many we didn't detect/intercept or if Russia's jets where a distraction while China moved stealth planes/ships/subs into the USA.

       And you are probably right that they are just drills, but the only reason Russia would practice flying to US airspace repeatedly is they are training.

       You are correct, I did fail to account for the fact that a large number of our troops are near Russia and China and theoretically if they attempt to invade us we could turn around and invade them.

      <p>
       Unless of course they have someway of disabling our (and our allies) ships, weapons and communications before they launched an attack on us.
