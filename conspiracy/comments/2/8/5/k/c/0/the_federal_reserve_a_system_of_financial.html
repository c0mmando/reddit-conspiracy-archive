       So I hear a lot of people say they don't like the Fed but not a lot of people explaining their exact methods. This is most likely because the Fed is so secretive. But, I read from some source I have since forgotten the process by which they operate. To begin:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Service were created on the same day
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Fed and the IRS work hand in hand to create the system of financial enslavement
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The reason we know this is because Ronald Reagan audited the Federal Government
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is how it works: It starts with income taxes. When asked why we need to pay income taxes the rational is because we need to pay for services. But, because of Ronald Reagan's audit of the Federal Government we know that this is simply not true. As it turns out, our income taxes are paying for the interest on the loans originated by the Federal Reserve. Therefore, the loans from the Fed are what is paying for the services, not our income taxes as people claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a system of perpetual debt, and another term for perpetual debt is financial enslavement.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in reality, we are paying interest to the Fed for the right to use our own money. What does that sound like to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is why Rand Paul wants to audit the Fed so much, because this type of practice would be exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Bureau of Internal Revenue was created in 1862, but it wasn't formally known as the Internal Revenue Service until 1953.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a federal income tax from 1862 to 1874. The Bureau of Internal Revenue continued after that, collecting taxes from alcohol, tobacco, and a few other non-tariff sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a new income tax passed in 1894, but the Supreme Court
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollock_v._Farmers'_Loan_%26_Trust_Co.">
        declared part of it unconstitutional
       </a>
       , so it was repealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1909, Congress passed the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">
        16th Amendment to the Constitution
       </a>
       , which made the income tax consitutional. It was finally ratified by enough states (36) in February, 1913 to be adopted as an amendment. Congress passed the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1913">
        Revenue Act of 1913
       </a>
       on October 3, 1913, which created the modern income tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve Act passed Congress on December 23, 1913. It was unrelated to the income tax, except that both were
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era">
        Progressive Era
       </a>
       reforms.  For its first 20 years of existence (except during World War I), the Federal Reserve did not buy Treasury bonds, so the revenue from the income tax didn't go to the Federal Reserve in any significant way. The Federal Reserve Banks paid a franchise tax to the U.S. government.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       I believe you're thinking about the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grace_Commission">
        Grace Commission
Report
       </a>
       . The Grace
Commission was a group of businessman which looked for inefficiencies
and waste in the government and issued a number of recommendations for
improvement, many of which were implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cover letter for the report had these two paragraphs, which I classify as being at least highly misleading if not an outright lie:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One-third of all their taxes is consumed by waste and inefficiency in the Federal Government as we identified in our survey. Another one-third of all their taxes escapes collection from others as the underground economy blossoms in direct proportion to tax increases and places even more pressure on law abiding taxpayers, promoting still more underground economy-a vicious cycle that must be broken.
       </p>
       <p>
        With two-thirds of everyone's personal income taxes wasted or not collected, 100 percent of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the Federal debt and by Federal Government contributions to transfer payments. In other words, all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services which taxpayers expect from their Government.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This web page discusses why this is wrong:
       <a href="http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/jsiegel/Personal/taxes/debt.htm">
        http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/jsiegel/Personal/taxes/debt.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That web page also mentions that most of the interest payments
       <em>
        do not go to the Federal Reserve
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to stress that: The federal government
       <strong>
        does not borrow directly from the Federal Reserve
       </strong>
       . The Federal Reserve purchases a portion of the Treasury bonds on the secondary market—usually between 10 and 20 pecent. That means that the Federal Reserve only gets that portion of interest payments. The rest goes to other owners of Treasury bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the Federal Reserve gives most of its profits to the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year, I personally calculated the percent of the
       <em>
        net
       </em>
       interest on the national debt that has gone to the Federal Reserve since World War II. From 1947 to 2007, only 2% of the net interest went to the Federal Reserve!
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 2007, the Federal Reserve has given far more
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       the government than it has received from the government.

       The Federal Reserve Act needs to be repealed. The Constitution states that Congress has control over the currency which is done through the Treasury Department. Since the Federal Reserve is a private bank, that violates the Constitution. Too bad politicians and the public believe it's a great thing to pay only interest on loans we can never pay back.

       If we're paying off the loans we used to build the roads or other services... WE ARE PAYING FOR THOSE SERVICES.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not perpetual debt, it's not a cycle. It's a simple loan payment situation. Where is the cycle? Of course there's perpetual debt, the government takes out loans to pay for things they don't have cash on hand for. It makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       No government that oversee's a country of our size can pay upfront for everything they do. Think about natural disasters. States can't pay for them (states that are binded to have a balanced budget by their constitution), so they turn to the fed, the fed borrows money by selling bonds at low interest, and pays to fix things that need immediate fixing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Financial enslavement? How? What is your solution? Not paying taxes? Only fixing roads, dams, bridges, veterans healthcare, schools, etc. on an as you go basis? Where would that money come from? Direct taxes? If anything your only complaint is that we have to pay interest instead of paying the initial amount, but as I explained, that doesn't work.

       IMO Its a debt based system of enslavement using Interest-Bearing Currency. Its nof "Federal" because its privatly owned, it has no reserves because it prints the money, and its not a system because its a criminal syndicate. If we were using non-interest bearing currency, like silver dollars or greenbacks, we wouldn't have a national debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imo the people who own the Federal Reserve are a group of families (Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Warburgs, and more aristocratic families of Europe) who are Sabbatean-Frankist "Jews" who practice rituals and incantations out of the Kabbalah, and superseed the will of God by creating something out of nothing (i.e money) which is a form of black magik.

       To answer your question, no I don't think we would lose the benefits of international trade. I'm no economist, but if the US had a non-interest bearing currency then the congress, along with the US treasury, would have the power to print/mint silver dollars or "greenbacks" without imposing interest to the general population.

       Yeah I get that but we cant just revert back at this point. The financial world is too forgone to current financial practices. This is a source of power for the financial system, its too big to fail on the largest scale possible. Carrol Quiqley's (sp) Tragedy and Hope covers this I believe - how a new world order will be created through the financial system. The TPP thing ties into this, it brings in countries into the fold of technology and whatnot and any country that doesn't join is in the stone age. /rant
