<p>The reality is that people start drinking because of peer-pressure and because society has forced the narrative on people that if you <em>don&#39;t</em> drink then there is something wrong with you.</p>

<p>Yet adults still do the same lol. Hangovers suck but adults still enjoy getting wasted, late-teens even more so. </p>

<p>The great thing about coke and bourbon is that you can effectively mask the taste of bourbon if you add enough coke. Or replace the bourbon with vodka if the smell of bourbon bothers you and you want it to be a bit stronger whilst still hiding the taste. </p>

<p>If you enjoy softdrink, you can enjoy a shot mixed in with it. And teens sure love softdrink. </p>

<p>And all of this is related to the fact that society deems drinking normal. So of course it is easier to get laid while drunk, the chick is drunk too. Of course it is easier to have social skills when drunk, everyone else is drunk.</p>

<p>All of this is related to what I said. Peer-pressure and society causes people to drink, and then drinking becomes normal, and then people benefit from this group-think. Its like mirrors reflecting on mirrors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take pure caffeine pills along with L-theanine. 2 to 1 ratio. My usual is maybe 3 times a week I take a 100mg caffeine pill (8oz cup o coffees worth), then 200mg of L-theanine. Pure awesome. No need for coffee (I&#39;ve had maybe 15 cups my entire life), control the dosage exactly, no fillers, no dairy or sugar. Just the L-theanine which unlocks the potential awesome from caffeine. The 2 work together to diminish the negative side effects of each &amp; enhance each other&#39;s strengths. L-t is a simple green-tea amino acid, completely harmless. I think it&#39;s by far the best &amp; least impacting method of using caffeine as a stimulant.</p>

<p>**Edit-Found this mention over at r/nootropics:</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Which cognitive enhancer would you recommend most?</strong></p>

<p>L-theanine and caffeine.</p>

<p>L-theanine appears to be both very safe and effective. It has a long history of use, an LD50 estimated to be over 1000 times larger than a standard therapeutic dose and no known contraindications with any food or drug. It may well be health-promoting. ref ref ref</p>

<p>The science behind the L-theanine-caffeine combination seems almost equally compelling. L-theanine seems to mitigate the negative aspects of caffeine, such as anxiety, increased blood pressure and diminished sleep quality, while improving upon the positive aspects. Its ability to enhance attention, over and above that of caffeine alone, has been repeatedly verified.</p>

<p>For beginners without a caffeine tolerance it&#39;s recommended to start with 50mg caffeine and 100mg of L-theanine. Once in the morning and once around noon.&quot;</p>

<p>Theres mold in coffee. Now before anyone gets worried most people can handle this with no issue, you eat and drink mold on a regular basis. </p>

<p>Some people have more difficulties and are more sensitive to these molds, now again this isnt everyone. Personally Im pretty sure I would die if I didnt drink coffee daily. </p>

<p>Edit</p>

<p><a href="http://authoritynutrition.com/the-mycotoxins-in-coffee-myth/">http://authoritynutrition.com/the-mycotoxins-in-coffee-myth/</a></p>

<p>Opposite end of the spectrum, just my belief that some people are sensitive to this. My recommendation would to be try some caffeinated tea and see if you feel the same way. </p>
