       I'm normally hesitant to endorse some of the conspiracy threads in this sub, but I accept that police saboteurs are a fact, and a tactic that police consider acceptable, which is of course completely unacceptable. We saw this in Canada at the G20, as well as other tactics like kettling, where the caught up completely innocent people and assaulted them.

       If you suspect that protestors are police saboteurs it is encouraged that you beat them into submission and relieve them of their duty. They are not welcome in peaceful protests -- cop or not.

       The most fouled up part is that they don't have to be actively serving as police, in any capacity, to have assaulted a police officer. He/she could identify themselves as an ordinary citizen, the moment you strike them you've committed a felony.

       No, the protesters should be made aware that this tactic may be used against them; and they should be prepared to respond, but not in a violent way. Perhaps having the  protesters immediately start pointing at the suspected saboteur and yelling at them to put their rock/stick down and shame them, or forming a human chain around the saboteur and incapacitate them while removing the kerchief they use to hide their face, and filming them, or some similar peaceful organized tactic would be more effective.

       People are still getting 3G and shit there, right? Thus the uploads of Vines and whatnot for footage?

       Would it be feasible for someone to get a site set up informing of these cops' tactics, things to watch out for, and the "ideal" methods of dealing with them, then it can get linked back to the people in the area to know how to deal with it?

       That sounds reasonable. I am not a fan of doxxing but in this sort of circumstance, it sounds completely reasonable that if it can be confirmed that the agent is in fact a member of the police force, a poster should be shared online and in the community stating his/her actions, identifying the officer and demanding that they be fired and whoever directed the activity be fired, and making that agent essentially unemployable in undercover police activity in the area. One of the few weapons available is public shaming. It should be clear that behaviour like this is completely unacceptable in any community; they are behaving fraudulently in ways which encourage the police to assault the innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, great care must be taken. Mistakenly identifying a person as a police agent could get them assaulted, or worse, killed.

       These are called provocateur agents. They will try to get the crowd riled up but if that doesn't work they can still cause some chaos on their own and like you said, just leave after the fact.

       I think we learned from OWS to distance ourselves from those creating trouble. But controlling a mob isn't really that easy, so getting everyone to not join in the destruction is pretty much impossible.

       Is there any way we can use that tactic against those that wish to do it to us?

       yep. we're discussing tactics though. occupying a space with molotovs and laser pointers is a good tactic to neutralize the effect of agents provocateur.

       It was started by bigger forces. The fight in Ukraine is not about the people. It's a proxy war between the US and Russia. Nobody gives a fuck about those people. Both sides want to rape Ukraine for their natural resources and land.

       Black Bloc was used to de-legitimize Occupy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully for TPTB, America has a long history of seeing a black face as synonymous with crime and violence. I bet the cops didn't even have to send black people in to get things started.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering there was looting at one store for two hours, and not even that's confirmed, I wouldn't be surprised if the cops didn't just SAY there was looting and it carried forward into the white media as plausible. They do this to black people

       source of past examples? pretty much decades of demonstrations in Europe.

       One specific example are the events of "2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests"

       "Agent provocateurs"... We've had those non-stop in Greece since the military dictatorship of the 60s-70s. I'm actually pretty sure I saw them initiate shit in the peaceful anti-austerity demonstrations of June 2010. They started as demonstrations, ended up as riots - thanks to those fuckers.

        "Red Squads"
       </strong>
       have been confirmed in NYC, Chicago, and L.A.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         In the United States, Red Squads were police intelligence units that specialized in infiltrating, conducting counter-measures and gathering intelligence on political and social groups during the 20th century
        </strong>
        . Dating as far back as the Haymarket Riot in 1886, Red Squads became common in larger cities such as Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles during the First Red Scare of the 1920s. They were set up as specialized units of city police departments, as a weapon against labor unions, communists, anarchists, and other dissidents.

       One can clearly see these tactics being used at the G20 protests in Toronto. "Anarchists" in balaclavas smashed windows and burned police cars while police in full riot gear stood back and let them do it. Why did the police not intervene then? Once the vandals were finished, they threw away their masks and disappeared The police then used ridiculously heavy-handed tactics on protestors with absolutely no way of knowing if they had been involved in the earlier vandalism. Only braindead hypnotized sheeple can't see how this was obviously a police operation using agents provacateurs. It was even more obvious in Montebello when the agent was discovered and escaped by going BEHIND the police line. He was also wearing the same standard issue boots as other police officers.

       If the "peaceful crowd" starts rioting, then they aren´t peaceful anymore. If "peacful crowd" goes along with fakes, then they had rioting in the mind in the beginning, they just needed the trigger. If agents wouldn´t trigger it   then something else would do it and the rioting would happen anyway.

       a manifestation may have ten of thousands of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       it takes a dozen of agents to create chaos. even if another dozen of people from the crowd join in, the number is not representative for the rest of thousands participants that are there peacefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       so your peaceful crowd is and remains peaceful but is still beaten by the police, because fuck democracy and human rights, who complains and don't love the authorities is a terrorist who needs to be beaten by our brave ignorant, low iq, brainwashed tugs.
