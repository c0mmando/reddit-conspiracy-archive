    <div class="md"><p>No, the protesters should be made aware that this tactic may be used against them; and they should be prepared to respond, but not in a violent way. Perhaps having the  protesters immediately start pointing at the suspected saboteur and yelling at them to put their rock/stick down and shame them, or forming a human chain around the saboteur and incapacitate them while removing the kerchief they use to hide their face, and filming them, or some similar peaceful organized tactic would be more effective.</p>

<p>People are still getting 3G and shit there, right? Thus the uploads of Vines and whatnot for footage?</p>

<p>Would it be feasible for someone to get a site set up informing of these cops&#39; tactics, things to watch out for, and the &quot;ideal&quot; methods of dealing with them, then it can get linked back to the people in the area to know how to deal with it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds reasonable. I am not a fan of doxxing but in this sort of circumstance, it sounds completely reasonable that if it can be confirmed that the agent is in fact a member of the police force, a poster should be shared online and in the community stating his/her actions, identifying the officer and demanding that they be fired and whoever directed the activity be fired, and making that agent essentially unemployable in undercover police activity in the area. One of the few weapons available is public shaming. It should be clear that behaviour like this is completely unacceptable in any community; they are behaving fraudulently in ways which encourage the police to assault the innocent. </p>

<p>That being said, great care must be taken. Mistakenly identifying a person as a police agent could get them assaulted, or worse, killed.</p>

<p>Thankfully for TPTB, America has a long history of seeing a black face as synonymous with crime and violence. I bet the cops didn&#39;t even have to send black people in to get things started. </p>

<p>Considering there was looting at one store for two hours, and not even that&#39;s confirmed, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the cops didn&#39;t just SAY there was looting and it carried forward into the white media as plausible. They do this to black people <a href="http://gamertherapist.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/looting.jpg">all the time</a> and chump ass Americans STILL fall for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>&quot;Red Squads&quot;</strong> have been confirmed in NYC, Chicago, and L.A.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>In the United States, Red Squads were police intelligence units that specialized in infiltrating, conducting counter-measures and gathering intelligence on political and social groups during the 20th century</strong>. Dating as far back as the Haymarket Riot in 1886, Red Squads became common in larger cities such as Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles during the First Red Scare of the 1920s. They were set up as specialized units of city police departments, as a weapon against labor unions, communists, anarchists, and other dissidents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One can clearly see these tactics being used at the G20 protests in Toronto. &quot;Anarchists&quot; in balaclavas smashed windows and burned police cars while police in full riot gear stood back and let them do it. Why did the police not intervene then? Once the vandals were finished, they threw away their masks and disappeared The police then used ridiculously heavy-handed tactics on protestors with absolutely no way of knowing if they had been involved in the earlier vandalism. Only braindead hypnotized sheeple can&#39;t see how this was obviously a police operation using agents provacateurs. It was even more obvious in Montebello when the agent was discovered and escaped by going BEHIND the police line. He was also wearing the same standard issue boots as other police officers.</p>
