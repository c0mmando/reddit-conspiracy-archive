<p>If we don&#39;t wise up, we will drive ourselves straight into the singular tyranny we fear most. We lack the organization, consciousness and calm reserve not to step right into the trap that is laid out before us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, the minute a 3rd party gains traction due to voters rejecting the R&amp;Ds, the facade of democracy will come crashing down hard on everyone&#39;s head- I believe the first action that the govt will take is a Ferguson 1,000X- meaning they will shock and awe the entire country. </p>

<p>I believe the best course of action is a unified non-compliance in which no complicated political theories are expressed other than the statement that American citizens no longer have confidence our government is providing the democracy we all believe is central to this nation-- then after that  announcement Americans just refuse to vote in any elections or participate in any polls en masse peacefully.</p>

<p>If MLK showed anything, it&#39;s that oppressors have difficultly responding to peaceful non-compliance.</p>

<p>To me what&#39;s clear is that only about 10% of the population graduating school these days can truly participate meaningfully in the economy- everyone else is just feeding on crumbs that are becoming more scarce as everything is automated.  But because the are citizens, they can&#39;t take the abundant cheaply payed jobs.  Thus a mass of people is just utterly stagnant.  The US simply allows the best and brightest of the entire world to immigrate here--how the heck are average Americans supposed to compete with the most gifted people of each foreign country?</p>

<p>And as long as the cost of living is so high, and employees have to either pay out profit and business killing wages to meet this cost of living or higher illegal immigrants, we are going to have a huge mass of people that is just being left to either become homeless or if they are lucky move in with family.</p>

They are weak and unorganized, already comfortable with a military state and raised on MTV without music.  Then they crush the resistance in a series of waves. wiping out much of the population. They are several years off. they have to wait till most of the older military and people that grew up on actual learning start to die off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have aligned yourself with negative thinking way too much. You might want to start looking at the positive side of things, and there are positive things going on in this conflict. The situation is already changing due to the amount of awareness that is rising in every individual. Its not going to be an easy take over like the originally planned. I think the main problem is for people not to get there attention hooked into the doom aspects of what is going on. Understand that reality is created by collective thought processes and if we think things are going to be bad its very likely that it will. &quot;Century of the self&quot; is an excellent video on how our materialistic society was created by a vision. The future is made by visions of the future and we can unmake reality and turn it into something different. Part of this has to do with aligning our thinking to smart projects that give us power instead of taking it away and then acting together to make it happen. I have been working on a commonwealths project to turn society into empowerment, but I cant do it myself.</p>

<p>I understand the theory of attraction. Goodness attracts goodness and such. If that seems to be the case then why are we in the situation we&#39;re in right now? Hasn&#39;t the picture of the future always been <a href="http://cdn.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/future_city_downtown.jpg">optimistic</a>?

<p>So how&#39;d we get where we are? Because, personally, I feel we are headed for the worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between positive thinking and an imbalance on how positively you think.</p>

<p>Most people i feel are dangerously imbalanced with their view on things. Change is good. Chaos leads to a higher rate of evolution. But as the other poster pointed out, its programmed evolution. Its evolution with an agenda. With every conflict or major event comes a narrative than ends up being stranger than fiction. We adopt and regurgitate these narratives and become ourselves, mediums for brainwashing others.</p>

<p>But most of the time thats all it is, regurgitation ... We swallow THEIR facts and spit them back out .. not much has been from direct experience.</p>

<p>Its a slippery slope were walking up.. and as much as the internet can and is and should be more of a medium for positive change, its having very many negative consequences on each and every one of us unwittingly; and worse on our children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read The Crowd a Study of the Popular Mind by Gustave Le Bon 1896. His crowd psychology explains what&#39;s happening perfectly. We are far past the point of change... reforms are violent, as crowds cannot change quickly, and can only be swain(sp?) to different beliefs very slowly. The time to spread ideologies is far from over... like the Germans of Nazi Germany, they were slowly changed, and by the turning, when people were being hunted door to door, that was the time to fight back, but no ideological change had occurred- no one fought back. We need a big change in ideas NOW, but that isn&#39;t going to happen. We cannot sway the public opinion fast enough without revolt and reform- which ends in violence and often time failure, and are rarely successful. The fall of the Roman Empire happened because of a change of ideas and ideology, the French Revolution happened via violent reform as scientific and industrial ideas up-heaved the rooted social, religious and political ideas of the day, by the power of crowds. Whom ever controls the crowd, controls the outcome. This is the era of crowds... in my opinion, the era of controlled crowds. Check the book out, you&#39;ll understand immediately just from the preface. And the only thing you&#39;re saving yourself from by seeing through these things is yourself- when they call every man to war, you can stand by and say &quot;no&quot; because you will know exactly why the men leave to fight. It&#39;s sad, but true. </p>

You are going to respawn in the game of course, but it&#39;s what you did with the time that&#39;s as given to you in that moment. Fight because you&#39;re here and now, you can make a difference with what&#39;s given to you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except none of that is going to happen. The authorities are going to back down. The cop that shot the kid is going to lose his job and might even be prosecuted. (For his own sake &amp; safety, he better be...)</p>

<p>Too many people all across the country got very pissed off about this, and rightly so. This might even be the catalyst that causes the pendulum to begin swinging the other way.</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m just an optimist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. They didn&#39;t spend billions upon billions of dollars to implement a surveillance and police state, simply to back down when the public begins to dissent. They&#39;ve militarized the police BECAUSE of public dissent. Do you really think that what happened in Ferguson was merely a case of a local PD gone rogue? That it took FOUR DAYS for the governor to reign them in? Hello no. Those police did exactly what they have been trained to do. Ferguson was but a taste of what is to come.</p>
