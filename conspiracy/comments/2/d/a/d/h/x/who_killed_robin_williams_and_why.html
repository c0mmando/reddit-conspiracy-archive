       What's going on that the Williams diversion is concocted to hide?
      </p>
      <p>
       Williams had too much going on for suicide...  family, wealth...
       <br/>
       He was an easy target to create a diversion.

       I have friends who lost parents to suicide.  A lot of them feel so alone and helpless, and when you have adult children and are so mentally drained and ill maybe just maybe the brain can convince you, "they're strong. they'll be fine without me.  i'm an embarrassment.  just look at me.  i'm so weak.  they'll be better without me..."

       Not every celebrity death has to be a conspiracy. Creatively intelligent people can be prone depression because the peaks and valleys of their emotional states can be extreme and varied.

       It is ALWAYS called an apparent suicide before a coroner confirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best friend's foster family found her hanging in her closet and it was called an "apparent suicide."
      </p>
      <p>
       A friend of mine found her father dead in their basement with his gun near him and it was "apparent suicide."
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of these people were very depressed, and they were legitimate suicides.  But they're always apparent until the coroner confirms, as to avoid spreading WRONG information to friends and family.  So they say "this is what it looks like to us - but we need to have professionals make the final call and confirm.

      <p>
       Jeez you people just want

       This "everything is a distraction" mentality is ridiculous. Robin Williams died. How could the government 'distract' us with that? You read an article on his death, feel sad, and within the hour, you're back doing what you were doing before, because most people have things to do. The news channels aren't going to run this story 24/7/365. And everyone who finds out about his death isn't going to go, "Oh my god, I'm sooo distracted! I'll never think about Gaza or Ukraine or ISIS again!" Yeah, a lot of people are going to be sad and mope because they really like Robin Williams, but the whole country, 300,000,000 people, are not going to be 'distracted' from the global geopolitical scene by his death for any length of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's this thing called the human mind. It's a complex thing. It's capable of making the human body do this sorcery called, 'Do one thing. Finish doing it. Then do another thing.' After reading an article about Williams or Bieber or some entertainment/celebrity news, you're able to then open another internet tab and type into the search box, 'Gaza invasion', 'Ukraine crisis', 'ISIS threatening genocide'.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the news, they alot different times to talking about different stories. Just because they're not blasting one story all the time, doesn't mean they're 'suppressing' it. They're going to talk about Robin Williams' death for fifteen minutes a day and what will they talk about for the other 1,425 minutes? Other news.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is really a big problem. So many critics of main stream media pride themselves on never watching it, and then complain that the MSM isn't talking about an important story. If you never watch it, how do you know what they are and aren't talking about?

       His CBS show was cancelled. He checked into a rehab to readjust himself. Sometimes people just kill themselves to kill themselves. Nothing to hide here. Assuming it's a ploy to cover up something bigger is not what's going on here.

       Based on that article it sounds like between losing $20 million in his two divorces and paying for all of Christopher Reeves medical bills he went broke and went looking for work again which still doesn't explain why he would take his own life. I am really curious wha tthe investigation turns up.

       Seems like it would fit better. The pocketknife cuts were probably inflicted by the family to reenforces the idea of suicide. Nobody does that stuff seriously.

       These events often have personal echoes. My grandmother died after falling from window and it was ruled suicide by the coroner.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that for the authorities, suicide is often the most "convenient" cause of death - no time-consuming and expensive police enquiry, no insurance claims, no "loose ends".

       Absolutely.  And we had suspicions with my best friend that she was either abused heavily by her foster parents, driving her to suicide, or killed by them directly and had her death staged as a self-hanging. Who would suspect a troubled teen to be murdered by foster parents?  The bruises that covered her body at her funeral were quite suspicious though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is really why I hope he wrote notes.  Authorities do tend to take the path of least resistance.  The eternal wondering and what ifs can almost drive loved ones to insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally though, if you're asphyxiated in your own home and have a history of mental illness, it's probably suicide. Falling out of a window is one thing.  You can't accidentally fall into a noose.
