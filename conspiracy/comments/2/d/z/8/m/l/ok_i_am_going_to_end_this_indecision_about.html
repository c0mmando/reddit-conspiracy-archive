        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Fluoride is a byproduct of the aluminum industry and strip mining, particularly the phosphate strip mining. The aluminum company of america (Alcoa) was the company mining for phosphates. The problem they ran into was the byproducts which included way more than just fluoride but that&#39;s for another time. </p>

<p>This is the process of phosphate processing</p>

<p>&quot;During the smelting and reduction process, when bauxite ( aluminium oxide ) is dissolved and electrolyzed in molten cryolite, hydrogen fluoride and other volatile fluorides are released into the air, and sodium fluoride remains in the bath&quot; ( source: Davenport, S. J., and Morris, G.G.: US Bureau of Mines. Circular 7687, US Department of the Interior, June 1954, page 8 ).</p>

<p>As you can see Alcoa has a problem they needed to either store or get rid of the byproduct they did not need. They at first tried to just dump it in the Columbia river near them and that back fired immediately because it killed the ground, grass and cattle in the field nearby. that happened in Dec 16th 1952. </p>

<p>At the end of World War II Americans had control of the German I G Farben factories and all of it&#39;s technologies. Charles Eliot Perkins was a researcher in chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and pathology. He and other scientists were put in charge of the Farben industries shortly after the cessation of hostilities but it was Perkins who was informed that the German General Staff adopted the plan of using sodium fluoride to make prisoners-of-war more docile and easier to manipulate and control. There is no surviving evidence to suggest the Germans did actually do this though it was well within their doctrine to carry out such a practice. It is also claimed that the ultimate intention of the Nazis was to fluoridate every country that they occupied and this story, which the Pushers are desperate to ridicule, has gained credibility in recent years for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>Perkins did try to stop the fluoridation program but he died to early to make an impact. Now Harley Rivers Dickinson did raise the issue and brought it to light in an &quot;Address in Reply to the Governor&#39;s speech in Parliament.&quot; Here is a quote from him concerning Mr Perkins </p>

<p>&quot;At the end of the Second World War, the United States Government sent Charles Eliot Perkins, a research worker in chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and pathology, to take charge of the vast Farben chemical plants in Germany. While there he was told of a scheme which had been worked out by them during the war and adopted by the German General Staff. This was to control the population in any given area through mass medication of drinking water. In this scheme sodium fluoride occupied a prominent place. Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual&#39;s power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotisizing a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him. Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners-of-war to make them stupid and docile.&quot; (Victorian Hansard of 12th August 1987)</p>

<p>So even infinitesimal amounts &quot;over time&quot; would eventually cause a reduction in you ability to resist control in one way or another. It gets even worse than that though. According to science it uncouples the DNA. The problem with that specifically is that DNA IS LIFE. Since America will not do any studies that directly point out oh hey that shit we are putting into the water is literally killing you softly I will provide a paper from china that shows its effect on DNA. 
<a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/12411198">http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/12411198</a></p>

<p>There is a ton more to this and I would love to make this shit an essay but I have been up for 20 hours straight and I am just starting to zone out. </p>

<p>This is a great link with lots more data and if you actually read the damn thing might see a couple of familiar names of people and companies come up like hmm J. P. Fuckhead Morgan, The Standard oil company, (also involved in cannabis prohibition because of greed) Dupont, (same shit with the bud as Standard oil), The Dow chemical Company, Kellog, Proctor &amp; gamble And Paul Warburg.  Quite the list of elites and corporations all over this like flys on poo huh? Anyways here is a good site to give you some of the information being intentionally tucked away so you cant rationally think for your self. 
<a href="http://www.beaconoftruth.com/f5.htm">http://www.beaconoftruth.com/f5.htm</a></p>

<p>I will be on much later if you have a question or you just wanna tell me how wrong I &quot;am&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: I am glad we have had the discussion on fluoride today. I must say I have learned a lot, I did not expect too. We have a lot of really bright people here and I hope that my responses have caused too many users stress lol. Either way guys I think the jury is still out on this issue but I have some reading to do and well its not what I think objectively. It is though about what we all think subjectively. Thanks guys for the time today and have a goodone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually <a href="http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9924296"><em>Hydrofluoric Acid</em></a> (they add silica to make Hydrofluorosilicic Acid which is like sand and easier to contain, store, and ship) boils at 226.4°F and water boils at 212°F.  But that is pure water.  Water with minerals, chlorine, microbes...tap water...could have a different boiling point and may be close enough to that of Hydrofluoric Acid that you may be distilling both at the same time while cutting down on the impurities in the water essentially concentrating the fluoride levels a little.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a little something you might want to consider when discussing fluoridation:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.sharecare.com/health/dental-drugs/how-does-systemic-fluoride-work">Q. How does systemic fluoride work?</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stacy Wiegman, PharmD, Pharmacy, answered</p>

<p>Systemic fluoride works to help your teeth fend off tooth decay in two important ways. <strong>When young children consume fluoride in drinking water and other beverages or in supplements, the fluoride is absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract, taken up by the bloodstream and deposited into the permanent teeth</strong> as they are developing behind the gum line. Systemic fluoride makes those developing teeth stronger and better able to withstand the effects of cavity-causing acids and bacteria later on. Once the permanent teeth have erupted from the gum line (usually by the time a child is eight years old), <strong>systemic fluoride still offers benefits because it becomes incorporated into saliva</strong>, making that protective. Talk to your dentist about the benefits of systemic fluoride and whether you and your family are meeting your fluoride needs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Into the stomach, into the blood, on into the saliva (and brain every other part of your body).</p>

<p>If Wegman is correct (and she certainly seems to be) we&#39;re all walking buckets of fluoride.</p>

<p>So, drink bottled water? What about your beer? Your soft drinks? Your &quot;from concentrate&quot; fruit juices? Were they manufactured using fluoridated municipal water?</p>

<p>What about your foods - soups, condiments, canned fruits and vegetables... anything that is processed with water?</p>

<p>Did you cook your pasta or beans or (whatever) using tap water? Guess what?</p>

<p>On a brighter note, I always used fluoridated water to wash my car, flush my toilet and water my lawn - and LOOK MOM! NO CAVITIES!!!</p>

<p>Fucking insanity.</p>

<p>You pay for city water, that again is a choice, you can pay for a well instead if applicable, you can again... install reverse osmosis like I mentioned.</p>

<p>You may not like the other choices, but they are still there, and relatively comparably priced.</p>

One of them was a girl I dated who was so self-conscious about it she had veneers put on all of her front teeth.

    <div class="md"><p>Not really.</p>

<p>The only two choices are A) Cities do it for us, and we don&#39;t have to handle the concentrated source of the material which is dangerous, which causes the (minority) of people who are totally against it to have to pay a small amount more to remove it.</p>

<p>or B) Cities don&#39;t do it and the people that want it have to add it themselves paying probably a similarly small amount to do it, and then normal people have to handle concentrated dangerous material.</p>

<p>Either way one side has to pay a slight bit more than the other. The way it is now (which may be changing, I admit, but as of now the &quot;Don&#39;t Cares&quot; + &quot;Do Wants&quot; are the majority compared to the &quot;Do Not Wants&quot;), the minority have to pay the slightly higher fee.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rainwater is usually worse than city water in hardness and in dissolved solids.</p>

<p>It should be filtered especially if being used from a large tank for entire home use. The iron content of rainwater can be anywhere from .7 to 1.8 from what I&#39;ve learned in the past. Which is too high, and will destroy any appliances you use it on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming there is extremely trace fluoride in it, but there very well may be zero. </p>

<p>Either way, it is worse for you to drink all the different elements and such. Like, lead for example, and Ozone, as well as big cities are going to contain lots of pollutants, and even the farmland chunks of the US is going to contain pesticides and other chemicals.</p>

<p>Depends on where you live, if you get rainwater with something like 200ppm dissolved solids, then you are probably just fine.</p>

<p>Filtered Rainwater however, is probably amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just how are they not forced into it? Because they have the option to install an RO filter??</p>

<p>I&#39;d say if your municipality puts it in your water, you&#39;re forced to have it - as you don&#39;t get an option to have it without (unless you have the resources to filter it out).  RO filters may be cheap to you - but to those without such resources, they&#39;re costly/prohibitive. (plus they waste a good deal of water in their use - which is a definite negative to those in drought-stricken areas, or those of us concerned about usage).</p>

<p>Most &quot;extremely cheap&quot; (to <em>you</em>) RO filters are those which have a single tap, and only filter the water coming out of it - which doesn&#39;t affect the entire house&#39;s water supply, as you seem to be inferring.  (You still will shower in the fluoridated water, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally have well water. At some point in the past, this home was on city water, and so I do technically have 2 main water inlets to my house. The city water has been shut off for many years, but the pipe still exists out to the main. (though I&#39;m sure since no water has been flowing it is likely corroded past the point of repair.)</p>

<p>The people you are speaking about who only have single taps, they have 5 or 8 gallon RO tanks.</p>

<p>I have the same filtration as those people do, however I have a 45 gallon tank that is directly out of my iron filtration system, and in place even before my water heater.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve run a full bath (faucet is 2.5gpm), and 15 minutes later my g/f has run a full bath, and we&#39;ve been unable to empty that tank and outpace the filtration, I have a quite large bathtub too, much bigger than most.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t the filter that is the limiting factor, it&#39;s the tank.</p>

<p>Please <em>thoroughly</em> explain how to source alternative water in one&#39;s home - and not via some RO / filter &quot;solution&quot; - I want to know who else is available as a vendor for water for a home, as you seem to imply.  Perhaps you envision living like those in Gaza do, with water tanks on every home?

<p>By your &quot;logic&quot;, you could also argue that you&#39;re not forced to use the natural gas that is piped into your home, or you&#39;re also not forced to breath the air in your home, etc. etc.  That line of thinking can get pretty asinine fairly quickly..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could have a tank on your home. The stories about people being sued by the city are blasted by the media as if they are happening all over the place, when they really aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>However, it is a bit primitive I will agree.</p>

<p>Well water is a perfectly valid source of water, and someone who finds this topic can easily use filtration on their home until such a point that they are able to have well water.</p>

<p>Spring water is also entirely viable for drinking/cooking/cleaning, and everything except for bathing.</p>

<p>Filtration can&#39;t be excluded as you say, because it is literally the cheapest most cost effective way to deal with it. After an upfront purchase, it costs like a quarter a day if that. It is a perfectly good solution until such time as you can get yourself into a springwater/well water situation.</p>

<p>People who live in huge cities, filtration is simply the best course of action, so it can&#39;t be neglected as if it&#39;s not a good one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, agreed - filtration is fine, if you can afford it, and if there&#39;s enough water to go around, as it&#39;s rather wasteful.  The thing is, we&#39;re (collectively) providing a utility &amp; infrastructure for folks to use and, by your logic, you just presume everyone can afford to take corrective measures and amend the utility provided.  I can assure you, not everyone has those kinds of resources (and here in drought-stricken CA, if everyone was RO&#39;ing their water, we&#39;d have an even bigger problem with supply, as we just don&#39;t have enough water to do that).  Also, i don&#39;t think you can just drill a well and get water any/everywhere (like on the coasts, for example), to say nothing of the fact people would be paying for a utility they aren&#39;t using - where&#39;s the logic there?
Wouldn&#39;t it make a helluva lot sense to just NOT fluoridate the water supply, and let people fluoridate themselves as they see fit?  I fail to see how this forced medication seems like a good idea.  Your solution of &quot;then take corrective measures&quot; just fails the logic test - when it would be far easier to just not put the stuff in the supply to begin with.  Where is the big win here?  The only benefit pro-fluoride people say is that it&#39;s good for your teeth - well, those benefits end when the water leaves your mouth.  Why ingest it when it&#39;s known to cause health concerns when it&#39;s consumed??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sense your cognitive dissonance.  You presume that all people have the necessary resources to filter their water.  I&#39;ve repeatedly tried to get you to consider that there are <strong>many</strong> folks who don&#39;t have the resources to filter their water (no matter how economical you feel it is), as well as the fact that there isn&#39;t enough water to have people RO filter the stuff out, but these facts seem to be oblivious to you. The initial costs to setup an RO filter are minimally a few hundred dollars (up to thousands), plus every year another hundred or so to replace the filters.  Not to mention the increased usage, as to RO filter water, creates a LOT of waste water.  This may not be much to you, but to more and more Americans, this is a very substantial, unaffordable cost - which could be eliminated by just not putting the stuff in the water to begin with, and letting us decide how much, when, and how to <strong>properly</strong> use the fluoride.</p>

<p>To argue this isn&#39;t &quot;force&quot; - seems like you&#39;re trolling.  You suggest that the municipalities putting it in the water supplies, <em>without the consent of the populace</em>, is somehow not a measure of FORCE.  Indeed, that&#39;s exactly what is happening and constitutes unsolicited FORCED medication on a widespread scale.  Why not just let us fluoridate as we see fit?  Why the need to have it forced - yes FORCED, upon us without consent? Unfortunately, fluoridation via water is not a choice in most of the USA.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like you&#39;re arguing that &quot;well, if ya don&#39;t like pepperonis on your pizza, you can always just pick them off&quot; - well, when I order a cheese pizza, i don&#39;t expect, nor do I want, pepperoni on it - even if you and the government just LOVE pepperoni and know how great they are.

<blockquote>

<p>Untrue, you can very easily start the whole process for about 100 dollars fully installed, along with around 15 bucks a month for renting. Nationwide brands such as Culligan and Clearwater both offer such services. 100 dollar setup and less than 15 a month... this is what is stiffling the populace into utterly being unable to afford it?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this is true</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They are putting it into an optional service that you are under no pressure to purchase from them, especially considering you know what you are getting into when you purchase/rent the home. None of your argument stands up when you realize, you are under zero obligation to rent, or purchase a home on city water, nor are  you under any obligation to keep that water turned on.</p>

<p>I fail to see any force being levied when once again, you&#39;ve not shown that anyone who can afford basic water from a municipality, can&#39;t possibly afford a few extra bucks, if this debate on fluoride is <em>that</em> important to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post is riddled with fallacies. Your genetic fallacy is almost text book. Not only that, but you couple it with both an anecdotal and appeal to authority fallacy and top it off by begging the question. Let me explain.. You argue that a supremely qualified person (appeal to authority) was sent to Germany where he was told by people (anedotal) about a plot of Nazi Germany (genetic) to use &quot;infinitesimal&quot; does of sodium fluoride to &quot;reduce an individual&#39;s power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotisizing a certain area of the brain&quot; (begging the question).</p>

<p>You then go on to argue that sodium fluoride decouples DNA by linking to a study that doesn&#39;t help your cause at all. In actuality, what you did here is called a fallacy of composition. You are assuming that because large amounts of sodium fluoride being injected directly into the brains of rats causes DNA damage, all other uses of sodium fluoride must cause DNA damage as well.</p>

<p>This thread is littered with ignorance like this. Sad day we live in where so many people are afraid of something that is proven to prevent cavities when used properly.</p>

<p>Not only do you need to diversify your language so you don&#39;t look like a bot, you also need to realize that there is no link to oral ingestion of fluoride ever helping reduce cavities or dental related diseases. Topical treatment, sure, but not from the water supply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no clear advantage of water fluoridation over direct application for prevention, and systemic exposure via drinking water is unlikely to benefit people whose teeth have already grown. Europe-wide trends show a reduction in tooth decay in 12 year-olds regardless of whether water is fluoridated or not.</p>

<p>Direct, topical application is the most effective way to prevent tooth decay. It keeps up fluoride levels in the mouth but does not normally raise them appreciably elsewhere.</p>

<p>In children, there is a very narrow margin between the beneficial effects of reducing decay and exceeding the dose which causes dental fluorosis. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given peoples discontent with the practice of, and the fact that  little to no  science exists showing benefit of and the cost factor, there isn&#39;t much of an argument to have to keep water fluoridation going. The happy medium is to accept that topical treatment works exceedingly well, and ingestion through water supply, even though trace amounts are &quot;topical&quot; there, that the water supply being fluoridated does next to nothing. As proven with peer reviewed studied and real world examples of 3rd world nearly ending tooth decay in some places without water fluoridation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am too tired to continue it for today. I planned on literally giving the entire history of it but w.e. Yes it effects the pineal gland and it also causes calcium problems. Which actually is why you get a calcified pineal gland, they don&#39;t call it a fluoridated pineal gland do they? lol Also I picked up a new word today when researching and its called <strong>Osteofluorosis:</strong> &quot;<strong>a generalized disturbance of bones caused by chronic fluorine poisoning and characterized by the development of multiple exostoses. There is lameness, ease of fracture of bones and mottling and pitting of the teeth.</strong>&quot; which is insanely ironic. The reason why is because you hear all the time to consume all the calcium you can, that can be a good thing if your other minerals are in check namely Magnesium. The problem though is how fluoride interacts with calcium. </p>

<p>Here I will just paste the bit:</p>

<p>As far back as 1993 the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry reported on the toxicological profile of fluorides and stated “<strong>because fluoride interacts with calcium ions needed for effective neurotransmission, fluoride can affect the nervous system</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition the Journal of Biological Chemistry found that fluoride not only inhibits enzymatic metabolism but that it also functions to prevent vital calcium and magnesium reactions as well as dramatically destabilising calcium binding in the body. Furthermore the Journal Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, found that systemic calcium and magnesium levels in the human body are depleted as a result of fluoride intoxication. The bio-availability of fluoride and the role of calcium were also reported as a matter of some concern by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) in 2002. They raised serious questions as to the health risks of water fluoridation in geographic areas with low calcium and magnesium levels such as  found in large areas of Ireland, particular Cork, Kerry. Limerick, Mayo and Donegal. Areas which also have an increased level of hypothyroidism most likely brought on from the increased bio-availability of fluoride in soft waters. </p>

<p>Fluoride is known to be capable of inhibiting a number of important enzymes in the human body, including preglycolytic enzymes, phosphatases, and cholinesterase. In addition, it is reported by the United States National Library of Medicine, that inhibition of one or more enzymes controlling cellular glycolysis may result in binding or precipitation of calcium as calcium fluoride. Perhaps one of the most alarming potential consequences of fluoride exposure, as highlighted in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine in January of 2012 (titled: <strong>Association of vascular fluoride uptake with vascular calcification and coronary artery disease</strong>.) is that a significant correlation exists between fluoride uptake and calcification of the major arteries, including coronary arteries. </p>

<p>That is, you are at a higher risk of having a heart attack with increased exposure to fluoride, for example by consuming fluoridated water</p>

<p>It would behoove you to have a bit of knowledge of psychology or neuro-chemistry to see why calcium being effected could have negative consequences. I hope I don&#39;t have to try to explain that one tired rofl... </p>

<p>This would only be caused by an extreme amount of fluoride ingestion, like <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16301964">this</a> case where a woman brushed 18 times a day and swallowed the fluoride toothpaste, because she liked the taste. Show me a study where just ingesting flouride in water would cause something drastically higher than the average of 1.5 micromol/L</p>

<p>dont worry about the haters, they dont realize how fluoride studies on LDL(lowest lethal) dosages mean nothing in terms of its long term heath affects which is basically the same shit like vioxx, which gets out there with only 90 day studies done, then kill a bunch of people, then get recalled, people don&#39;t to like to believe they have been fooled</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nailed it, I started reading labels in about 2006 and that really opened my eyes. I had to actually be responsible and learn about what I am eating because it really through me off to know that their is like 40 ingredients in a cracker... most of which I cant tell where they came from lol. That&#39;s my go too thing If you don&#39;t know what it is, then why is it in your food. Yea big pharma could sell crack as a prescription if they had a 90 day trial and only half the people committed suicide within a weak. I am exaggerating but its pretty much true. </p>

<p>You know its hilarious to me and probably only me but when people offer me a head ache pill or something I say no thanks I don&#39;t do drugs and I really mean it. But I truly believe in psychadelics being a tool for good in the world and smoke da bud. But see in my mind those are not &quot;drugs&quot; they are plants and shrooms and cacti. Soo yea. At least I know I am not gonna lose my mind on some natural stuff. </p>

<p>I remember being in jail seeing this dude all fucked up on prescription medicine. He looked lifeless like a functioning zombie, quite literally. He groaned and moaned but never spoke, seemed like he was seriously in a whole nother place or just unconciously functioning. That has to be one of the worst things you could do to your self. Allowing these people to guide your life for you. </p>

<a href="http://www.radio4all.net/index.php/program/73676">http://www.radio4all.net/index.php/program/73676</a></p>

<p>Flouride ruined my teeth before I was 10 years old with brown/white discoloration.  I still got cavities.  </p>

<p>When I went off the stuff, I stopped getting headaches as often and felt more clear in my head.  Meditation and concentration became way easier.</p>

<p>Between the mercury fillings and flouride, I spent the first 30 years of my life probably 10 iq points below my actual level of intelligence, and who knows what other effects.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing, it&#39;s well known that babies, who don&#39;t even have teeth yet, are harmed most by flouride but in 95% of grocery stores you can only get &#39;infant water&#39; with flouride added.  And unless it says specifically, i hope, &#39;no flouride added&#39; all &#39;natural&#39; and &#39;spring&#39; water has flouride added because it is just tap water from new jersey or something.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up with fluoridated water at my parents&#39; house, and the first couple of houses I rented also had municipal water.  But then moved to where I am now, with wonderful sweet clean water from a well.  No chlorine, no fluorides.  My children have grown up with this water.</p>

<p>Back in the 1980s, I worked with a guy who had an inorganic chemistry PhD.  His postgrad work was entirely in fluorine compounds.  Since getting his degree, he had entirely banished any fluorides from his life.  He drank bottled water and brushed with baking soda to avoid fluoridated toothpastes (few alternatives back then).  He said that fluorine compounds were entirely anti-life, they disrupt normal biological processes.  This was back when anti-fluoride people were few and far between, disparaged in the press and even in movies.  (Dr. Strangelove for example.)  He was a sharp guy, not paranoid; and since he&#39;d actually studied these compounds as a scientist, I tended to believe him.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve noticed any profound changes, but the changes would be gradual, wouldn&#39;t they?  Also, I don&#39;t have a hypothetical &quot;control me&quot; who continued to ingest fluorides, to use as a comparison.</p>

<p>I like to think I&#39;m healthier for it, but of course I can&#39;t offer any proof.  Ghod knows I&#39;ve ingested plenty of other toxins in my lifetime, deliberately or not.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always hoped to hear someone&#39;s personal story about going fluoride free but it&#39;s probably very hard to do. Also, if there are any negative effects of ingesting fluoride who knows if they can be reversed or how long it would take?</p>

But yes sir you sure can make perform this at home with very minute effort, though some of those distillers are expensive. There are some water suppliers that will deliver distilled water with a report on the latest water test. I have no idea WHO does that service though, sorry.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um carbon filter is supposed to remove it. Most water filters that I have seen use carbon filter then a regular filter. The fluoride is not removed by 99% of common filters and that includes Brita. Distillation is the only way I am even aware of that for sure removes it. making a carbon filter is pretty darn simple if I remember correctly too.

    <div class="md"><p>One problem you will also have to worry about is catching your water at the main instead of at the tap. Like a whole house system. People seemingly forget that drinking water is not the only factor in absorption of fluoride. Transdermal absorption is very good for nearly all substances. It is something like 90% or more. So yea just because you filter your drinking water would not guarantee your protection because you are also bathing in it. Best advice I can give is take cold Showers so as to not open the pores and keep it short. </p>

Other filter material like activated alumina will remove fluoride but there is some danger of the filter material getting into the water.. depends on the system.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea the activated alumina is a bad choice. It has to flow so slowly through it and then you are trading fluoride for aluminum toxicity.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done a fair amount of research on this subject, and there is an incredibly long list of good arguments against fluoride. However, the argument about the connection between fluoride and nazis seems to be anecdotal, and possibly even made up. <a href="http://onespeedbikerpolitico.blogspot.com/2010/05/debunking-fluoride-use-by-nazis.html">This</a> blogpost sums up the misconceptions pretty well.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate that this was your main argument against fluoride. I don&#39;t have time to cite all my sources right now, but here are a few good reasons that I can think of against water fluoridation:  </p>

<ul>
<li> Calcification of the pineal gland. Important for production of melatonin and sleep cycles. It is also the source of the &quot;third eye&quot; for those who are more spiritually inclined. Even Descartes speculated that the pineal gland is the &quot;seat of the soul.&quot;<br/></li>
<li>Fluoride is a proven neurotoxin</li>
<li>The majority of early studies on the effect of fluoride on dental health were studies on adolescents, not adults. There does seem to be some evidence for the positive effects of fluoride on developing teeth, but I have found very little about the efficacy of fluoride preventing cavities in adults.</li>
<li>Dental fluorosis</li>
<li>Skeletal fluorosis</li>
<li>CONSENT</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always thought the best argument against fluoride is the fact it is mass medicating an entire population.  Even if it&#39;s good for you, who&#39;s to say it&#39;s good for other people.  And <a href="http://thezoepost.wordpress.com/">who will be held accountable when a batch Chinese fluoride turns out to be something else</a> and actually injures someone, luckily this time they pulled it quickly. </p>

<p>Edit: By the way, the counter argument I get is they already add other chemicals to the water, which are for sanitary reasons (I agree with sanitizing water), which is than construed as medicating because they are sanitizing the water trying to keep people from getting sick.  </p>

<p>Every argument I&#39;ve heard <em>against</em> fluoride has to do with it being ingested, as opposed to just topical use. I don&#39;t see a reason why we can&#39;t just say, &quot;yeah, sure, use it on your teeth, but let&#39;s stop putting it in the drinking water&quot;?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the cheap ones like Brita, just have charcoal and won&#39;t remove too much beyond a bit of chlorine and particulates.  A fluoride removing faucet set up will use reverse osmosis, deionizers, or activated alumina and will run you between $100 and $200.

    <div class="md"><p>I worked at a RO plant.  If you set the recovery rate to 50% (half RO water and half unused) then you might still get some fluoride.  If you have a 10% recovery machine (90% waste) the water will be much more pure.  DI water (De-Ionized) is the purest and is too pure.  DI water is used to etch glass, you can&#39;t drink it straight.  I expect the fluoride filters are the most economical and practical choice. No waste, change filters as needed.   </p>

<p>Note that we are getting more fluorine than we assume due to people pissing/flushing their meds away.</p>

<p>I once read an interesting hypothesis as to why many of the fluorinated medications can cause psychosis reminiscent of PCP when improperly metabolized--something about the fluorine mixed with something else, but I haven&#39;t been able to find it since...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea what pisses me off is man that fluoride has to mess with the pineal gland. The master hormone gland. Most doctors call the pituitary the master hormone gland but that is not completely true. The pineal gland is the part of your body that effects your sleep wake cycle ...so if you are getting crap quality sleep it could be because of a calcification of you pineal gland inhibiting your homeostasis. More sunlight increases your meletonin formation at night though and apparently the light from the sun can reduce the calcification slowly but surely. </p>

<p>Oh and yes I have a hypothesis about that actually. This again has to do with the pineal gland. I have been around a lot of psychedelics and I know what it is to trip. Thing is almost everyone I know feels that the trip seems to emanate from a central point. Once thing almost every person experiences on a high dose trip ( at least as far as I have heard and experienced my self) is the pressure in the head and it feels as if the center of your head is a projector. </p>

<p>What I am getting at is the pineal is the gateway to the other side in one way or another. I mean look at that guy with the surgery posted here in the sub. He had surgery on his pineal because of a tumor or something and his artwork is just like and mushroom art or peyote art or lsd etc. SO fluoride calcifying your pineal could absolutely cause symptoms or even full blown manifestations of psychosis. A perfect example would be schizophrenics, They have all sorts of symptoms that are very much like a psych trip. Either way there is some correlation there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my take,</p>

<p>You can&#39;t find much legitimate non-positive studies on Fluoride in the States and most other democratic nations.</p>

<p>So you go and get data from one of the most repressive regimes in history, China?</p>

<p>Come on now, Banking on a country having actual factual data when they have proven time and time again that they can not control their own adulterated food supply is just a joke and is reaching for straws.</p>

<p>Take China out of the equation totally and you might have a leg to stand on. Or why don&#39;t you go live in China if you so feel that they are better at telling the truth, especially to their own people.</p>

<p>You have a choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/tb/2dqwwi">http://www.reddit.com/tb/2dqwwi</a></p>

<p>is a better article and the better theory hypothesized that it is not the Fluoride but ill refined Fluoride that is the problem. (I know they are putting this in the water so we need to stop it, Same Argument, YES we need to stop the use of Adulterated Fluoride but not the use of Fluoride.)</p>

<p>Fluoride has always been obtained through refining of metals,</p>

<p>WE do know without a doubt that heavy metals can effect, destroy, alter the brain. Irrefutably.</p>

<p>The lab is a different than real life. I would put that the credible labs are not using the same Fluoride that is actually going in the water but Fluoride that is pure therefore they are not getting any problems. </p>

<p>Maybe China is right but if they are using the Fluoride that has Heavy Metals in it then their results are an effect of the Heavy Metals not the Fluoride itself.</p>

<p>I might of wandered but my message is that by all indications Fluoride is safe. What we MOST likely have is a problem with the Fluoride source being contaminated with Heavy Metals. That is why there is a lot of Corollary Data like IQ of populations in Fluoride areas VS Non Fluoride areas. but no reputable lab results and Academic Papers.</p>

<p>It might be right to get rid of the Fluoride in the water supply or change to a better supply of Fluoride. but NOT to stop using it, IE Fluoride Drops or other Pharma Grade solutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back when I was in middle school, (early 2000&#39;ish) I remember us being given little cups fluoride by the school nurse twice a week to swoosh around and spit out. (I remember a couple class clowns who would swallow it nearly every time aswell) It was 6th and 7th grade and it was optional... but of course sheep mentality prevailed, and nobody as far as I can recall opted out.</p>

<p>My concern is I wonder if this is still happening in schools... and if so, should we really be subjecting our future generation to these kinds of chemicals, just for some pretty white chompers? Given the OP&#39;s info is indeed true... </p>

<p>The real effects of fluoride ingestion needs to be brought to light... soon... because if it truly is in our public water supply too... well we&#39;ve got a shit load of work ahead of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two types of fluoride to consider: natural and synthetic.</p>

<p>Calcium Fluoride: which naturally occurs in the earth&#39;s crust and is in the ground water. From what Ive read it is considered least harmful because its highly insoluble and has calcium in it which is an antidote to fluoride toxicity. But it should be noted that all fluorines are considered toxic to humans.</p>

<p>And then synthetic fluorides which are often the byproducts from industry.</p>

<p>Sodium Fluoride: used in toothpastes, mouthwashes, and even as &quot;nutritional&quot; supplements. </p>

<p>Fluorosilicic acid: This is what is mostly added to fluoridate the water supply. The CDC approximates that 95% of our water is fluoridated with fluorosilicic acid. (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/factsheets/engineering/wfadditives.htm#a1">http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/factsheets/engineering/wfadditives.htm#a1</a>). Fluorosilicic acid aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexafluorosilicic_acid">Hexafluorosilicic acid</a> is corrosive, cities that added it to their water began having problems with their pipes corroding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The anti-fluoride conspiracy is not grounded in fact, at all. The most compelling argument is that fluoridated countries have shown little to no improvement in dental caries compared with non-fluoridated countries according to WHO and NIH data, even though <a href="http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/261284">study</a> after <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0528.1997.tb01729.x/abstract">study</a> after <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0528.1997.tb01729.x/abstract">study</a> after <a href="http://jdr.sagepub.com/content/75/9/1687.short">study</a> indicate that fluoride does have a positive effect on tooth enamel. This discrepancy lies with comparing a general population when fluoride is most effective given to children under 10.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact that many of the anti-fluoride studies used Chinese data which is 2.5ppm, or 250% greater than safety guidelines recommend, the fact that most water is <em>naturally</em> fluoridated between .5-4ppm and that most &#39;fluoridated water&#39; is simply treated to bring this to an optimal level, the fact that the German mind-control theory can&#39;t be traced back more than 20 years from any reputable source, the fact that pineal calcification only occurs when consuming a <a href="http://meridianenergies.net/the-effect-of-fluoride-on-the-physiology-of-the-pineal-gland/"><em>ridiculous</em></a> amount of fluoride, the fact that the owner of tom&#39;s non-fluoridated toothpaste is a huge backer in the anti-flouride movement, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Also in your links regarding DNA damage, like research touted by pretty much every anti-flouride source, the amounts given were WAY past toxicity. 150ppm/L in water would cause ill effects in any living creature and is 149000% greater than the levels proposed in drinking water.</p>

<p>Does water need to be fluoridated? No, not unless you&#39;re under 10 and never brush your teeth. Is it safe? Absolutely.</p>

No one, it started when a study or two were misinterpreted (in fluoride&#39;s case, when the levels administered were known to be toxic yet that factoid was left out of sensationalist headlines). Fluoride is completely safe at about .7ppm/L to 1.5ppm/L, and virtually every doctor and dentist agrees with that.

<p>I will look at the studies and draw my own conclusion but you are absolutely right about a lot of what you said. Toms of main is definitely just using marketing to sell tooth paste lol </p>

<p>My only question for you is what about the babies born and given water with fluoride? Would that harm their body because of a lack of a BBB (blood brain barrier) Obviously all the other contaminants would cause problems but I am just asking about fluoride. </p>

<p>Also I do not expect an answer to that because I realize its pure speculation. Just a casual answer will do since you provided plenty for me to read through on a more relevant topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here in Santa Cruz, California, our municipal water supply is <strong>not</strong> fluoridated, and I&#39;m not sure how much you know about good ol&#39; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz,_California">Santa Cruz</a>, but suffice to say, this town does not exactly jive with the rest of America, and certainly cannot be seen as &quot;submissive&quot;. (from the <a href="http://rcnv.org/">Resource Center for Nonviolence</a> to the activist Veterans, to the very liberal nature of the government, police, etc., just a stroll downtown and one can immediately sense this town is fairly unique.)  &quot;Keep Santa Cruz Weird&quot; is an unofficial motto.  Santa Cruz was rather alone back in 2003 when they officially <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/14/local/me-santacruz14">condemned the Iraq invasion and requested impeachment of dubya</a>, and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marijuana-is-medicine-in-santa-cruz/">distributed medical cannabis from city hall to beloved resident Robert Anton Wilson, back in 2002</a>.  There are countless examples of Santa Cruz being <strong>officially</strong> non-submissive. It would be interesting to compare/contrast other municipalities which don&#39;t fluoridate - what other cities don&#39;t?</p>

<p>Does it all stem from non-fluoridated water?  Who can say, but one can definitely infer Santa Cruz is one of few rather non-&quot;submissive&quot; cities in America.</p>

<p>Some people don&#39;t have access to other sources of water due to poverty, illness, etc.</p>

<p>The fact is they make a tremendous effort to clean the water up and they just poison it afterwards with fluoride. They do it with OUR tax dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just drinking it.  There are studies out showing that fluoride can go right through your skin, so if you shower, bathe, swim, or anything with it, you are still getting those infinitesimal doses.  Against your will.  That lead to Alzheimer&#39;s disease, an average of 7 less IQ points in children, and other neurological disorders, (as well as broken hips in the elderly through fluorosis of the bones).</p>
