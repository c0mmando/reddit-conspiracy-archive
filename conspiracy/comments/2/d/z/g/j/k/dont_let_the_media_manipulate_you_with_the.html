        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are two distinct issues here that seem to be getting packaged together to create a false dichotomy.</p>

<p>One issue is the shooting itself and whether or not it was a murder.  The other is the police militarized response to the demonstrations.</p>

<p>The initial reports definitely did make it seem as though it could have been a brute cop with an itchy trigger finger.  But the more hard evidence that comes out, the more it appears that there may be more to this story than was originally thought.  From the video of the theft showing Brown intimidating a man at the store to the recorded conversation where the eye witness said he charged the cop, this is by no means an open-and-shut case of yet another police murder.</p>

<p>Being someone who doesn&#39;t think the cops should exist in the first place and views them as thugs in general, you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find me making excuses for them.</p>

<p>That said, the police militarized response is an entirely separate issue.  There is no question that the people have a right to protest (meanwhile, looters have a right to be shot in the face by shop owners so as to not be confused with the peaceful protesters).  Whether we&#39;re dealing with a racist, murderous cop or a thug kid who was attacking a cop, the people don&#39;t have to ask permission to demonstrate.  And the cops <em>certainly</em> don&#39;t have a right to the gear, tactics, or mentality that they&#39;ve put on display here, in Oakland, and Boston.</p>

<p>Yet, we&#39;ve seen this hijacked by the brainwashed left/right media and their viewers packaging both together as a left/right issue.  If you think there&#39;s more to the shooting than just &quot;<em>racist!</em>&quot;, then clearly you love the cops having snipers, tanks, and rocket launchers.  If you&#39;re someone who is against the militarized weaponry, then clearly, the cop who shot is a murderer and you don&#39;t need any further evidence from the event.</p>

<p>Be open to evaluating evidence as it surfaces.  <em>Don&#39;t</em> tolerate the police power grab that&#39;s been ongoing for the past 40 years.</p>

<p>And more than anything, don&#39;t let Fox and MSNBC play you.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr - Don&#39;t let the media manipulate you into the same old left/right packaging of issues.  You can be against the militarized police protest response while still objectively evaluating the evidence about the instigating event.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  This is one of those things I&#39;m keeping an eye on.  If it&#39;s true, that would be consistent with the story that Brown slammed the door on him which would give credence to the part about the gun struggle.</p>

<p>Could he self inflict that?  It&#39;s possible.  But if the rest of the evidence (current, or any other bits to come) fits that story, then it would be part of the total picture to weigh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That might be true.  Though, that has no bearing on the main point which is that issue is separate from the militarization issue.  I didn&#39;t say that the cop <em>didn&#39;t</em> murder Brown.  I&#39;m just saying that the new information I&#39;ve seen made available has been oddly filtered and/or twisted.</p>

<p>For example, we&#39;ve seen over and over that he was shot 6 times.  It&#39;s even been said that he was shot from the top of the head which is consistent with an &quot;execution style&quot; shooting.  However, looking at the current facts, I don&#39;t think any rational person would be able to conclude that the cop stood over this kid, made him kneel and shot him in the head, as this language would suggest.</p>

<p>We also know that contrary to the initial report, he was shot from the front according to both the autopsy <em>and</em> the conversation recorded at the scene.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not trying to make a judgement one way or the other.  There are clearly questions that need to be answered from both sides.</p>

<p>To reiterate my main point: this is a completely separate issue from the militarization.  You can be pissed about that while keeping a level head about the shooting that is by no means open and shut either way.  I&#39;m speaking mainly to the people who are calling for this cop&#39;s head while twisting the facts that we have now in order to fit this into some more left/right racism narrative.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a rational person and I conclude that the cop shot him while surrendering.  The cop didn&#39;t make Mike Brown surrender, or get on his knees; he just didn&#39;t stop shooting when he did.  And my rationality is based on the fact that a 6&#39;4&quot; dude was shot in the top of the head.  I hear that there was an eyewitness that said Brown &quot;bum rushed&quot; the cop but Brown would have to be a 3-point stance to get shot in the head like that.  Or the cop was 8&#39;, which is not rational</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that is a very rational, well articulated point.  And I would say it is very plausible.</p>

<p>I would also say that it&#39;s possible that the cop was still firing as he was going down, which in a tense moment is very possible.</p>

<p>Neither could possibly be proven with the available information.  But from the available information, I think as a rational person, you could agree that nothing here is open and shut (or rather &quot;beyond a shadow of a doubt&quot;).  There are still plenty of questions to answer before &quot;execution by racist cop&quot; could be concluded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much agree that a definitive conclusion is not at hand.  For instance the autopsy report provided by Mike&#39;s family is only preliminary and the government hasn&#39;t spoken on that issue as of yet.</p>

<p>Also, I wish to clarify my previous statement in that in no way did I mean to intend the cop was racist for shooting Mike in the head.  I don&#39;t believe that nor think it&#39;s necessary for the possibility I outlined to be true.  However, the dome shot could be due to the militarization of the police force discussed earlier.  The military shoots to kill and keeps shooting which would correlate with the incident at hand and demonstrate why the militarization of the police is a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not entirely certain that the fact that his intention was &quot;shoot-to-kill&quot; is automatically a symptom of the militarization either.</p>

<p>No doubt, that <em>is</em> a trend we are seeing around the country whether their killing dogs or 14 year old kids playing hookie.  On the large, cops have gotten waaaay too comfortable with pulling the trigger.</p>

<p>That said, cops are nothing more than people being paid to do something that any person could do on their own (any delusions of additional rights and authority or just that: delusions).  If I were I had my face smashed up in a struggle with the guy over my gun and he charged me, I would have shot to kill as well.  In fact, when you shoot, if it&#39;s not to kill, then you open yourself up to more danger than if you had no weapon.</p>

<p>Again, all of this assumes that the cop&#39;s side of the story is the truth.  If it turns out to be completely bunk, then your proposition regarding the excessive use of deadly force would be correct.</p>

<p>In short, I return to the idea that the militarization and the are two distinct issues that aren&#39;t connected (that is until, as you pointed out, it&#39;s proven that he was not acting in self defense).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that there are elements of a left/right split here, just not a republican/democrat split. The US media bias(s) (Idk the plural of bias, but each station has one, so more than one bias) is more of a democrat/republican split.</p>

<p>Why you look at the issue, you see issues of classism/racism(the two are often related), as well as police militarization. Historically, the left as a whole has been much more active in fighting racism and classism as a whole, which does split the left and the right on that particular part of the issue. </p>

<p>I will admit the the police mililtarization isn&#39;t as polarized on left/right lines, as parts of both the left and the right oppose it, and parts support it. But you admitted that &quot;it is an entirely separate issue.&quot; So while the entire situation shouldn&#39;t be viewed as left vs right, there are definitely aspects of it that are split along those lines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would add to also reject the obvious agitation propaganda campaigns to fit this all up as a black vs white &#39;racial&#39; issue. Demonising protesters and the community by bad-jacketing them as criminals, looters or mindlessly violent mobs. This is a coordinated media stunt backed up with agenda-driven racist clowns and operatives race-baiting via social media. I&#39;ve no doubt that there are numerous agent provocateurs and base opportunists operating in Ferguson, Missouri. However you can&#39;t juxtapose or associate the criminal actions of the few onto the outraged people of Ferguson, any more than you can blame all G20 protesters for the actions of provocateurs who wantonly smash and burn. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a great example of a government orchestrated agit-prop campaign: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giOvj8-s8oU&amp;amp;feature=share">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giOvj8-s8oU&amp;amp;feature=share</a></p>

<p>What this is, is a pre-emptive counter-measure used as a gambit and desperate attempt, to prevent people from unifying on a common issue utilising the threadbare strategy of divide and conquer. No, sorry, this is an issue of a paramilitarised police force using Draconian measures and military equipment to suppress dissent, protest and alternative media coverage. They pulled nearly the same stunts in NY on Occupy Wall Street, only there they couldn&#39;t get away with the military gear, tear gassing and shooting of rubber bullets. </p>

<p>What we are witnessing is the ever-escalating ramp up of police violence and terror used against the populace. In just this recent period I&#39;ve read mounting accounts of egregious brutality and utter, psychopathic disregard for the rights of the populace. Elderly women tear gassed and assaulted, a mentally challenged young man beaten to the ground for having a &quot;suspicious bulge&quot; on his leg which turned out to be his colostomy bag. A baby burned in a crib from a flash bang grenade and handicapped people literally dumped out of their wheelchairs and beaten. Kelly Thomas, an innocent homeless man brutally beaten to death by police while his tortured screams for his father were mocked. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about law-enforcement, it&#39;s about the propagation of state-sanctioned police terror, murder and violence, and people of all races, genders and ages have fucking had well enough of it. </p>

<p>When we unite, we win and that is what they&#39;re most terrified of.</p>

<p>The left likes welfare programs but won&#39;t consider study after study that shows welfare creates dependency, doesn&#39;t lift people out of poverty, and in fact, private charities are around 80% more effective at getting money and assistance to the poor.

<p>It&#39;s the whole &quot;give a man a fish&quot; adage. It&#39;s kinda, extremely, truly, true.</p>

<p>Nice blog though. I am sure there was no bias involved. </p>

<p>Reality is (I know people like you only like hypothetical reality, but this is the real thing) people can&#39;t always succeed in life. Sometimes they get screwed by things out of their control, and life gives them the bad hand. And people like that, like it or not, need welfare. </p>

<p>But clearly the free market has made us way more efficient than other countries with universal health care, right?</p>
