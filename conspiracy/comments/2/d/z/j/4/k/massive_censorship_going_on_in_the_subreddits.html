<p>I just took a peak at her blog; she claims that the &quot;personal matters&quot; are what she wants stricken from the record. That&#39;s infuriating, as her very personally attached vagina appears to have played a significant role in coercing &quot;journalists&quot; et al. to do her bidding. </p>

<p>If her plan overall is to hurl women&#39;s rights back to the stone age, she&#39;s doing an admirable job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know she is a confirmed pathological liar who has matyred people for her own gain before, right?</p>

<p>I would be very comfortable in thinking exactly zero people have threatened her friends and family.</p>

<p>She is confirmed for faking her own doxxing, faking her Twitter and Tumblr accounts being hacked. She lied about Wizardchan &quot;raiding&quot; her when she needed press for her Steam Greenlight.</p>

<p>She has 4chan, Tumblr and Reddit pretty much united against her. All groups that normally loathe one another.</p>

<p>So let me ask you this: would you take the word of a confirmed pathological liar?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with you, and I&#39;m not necessarily taking her word.</p>

<p>However, being a student of history and human psychology I know people easily get carried away in their witch hunts (hence the anti-doxxing policy of many websites including reddit). I was only offering a word of caution with a side of condemnation. Just a reminder to hold ourselves to a higher standard than those we have grievances with, lest we become worse than them.</p>

<p>I realize she could very well be making this up, however I don&#39;t know enough about the situation or people involved to know anything for certain one way or the other. It seems like if threats are indeed being made that would be easily verified. As far as being a &#39;confirmed&#39; pathological liar I&#39;d need to see a diagnoses from a Dr. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Woman (Quinn) makes a flash based game (more of one of those text based choose your own adventure things) about battling depression</p></li>
<li><p>The game receives critical acclaim from gaming journalist websites, and makes its way onto Steam</p></li>
<li><p>Quinn&#39;s ex boyfriend releases chat logs about her cheating on him with various men </p></li>
<li><p>Some of these men are key players in gaming journalism, and are responsible for the positive press Quinn&#39;s game received</p></li>
<li><p>Mods of gaming forums including <a href="/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a>, <a href="/r/Games">/r/Games</a> and 4chan&#39;s /v/ are removing all traces of this drama. At least one mod from <a href="/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a> talked to Quinn on Twitter beforehand.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus drama: All of her contact information is doxxed, she accuses 4chan. 4chan denies it claiming all the threads are being deleted so there was no way to organize it. Some people are accusing Quinn of doing it to herself to play the victim. She&#39;s faked similar harassments in the past using her &quot;contacts&quot;. Apparently the doxxed information was fake anyway.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just apparently, the numbers she gave belonged to Hawaii. Her dad&#39;s number that was listed on the blog belonged to a gas station in Hawaii - the same number she claimed was being called by random people on her twitter.</p>

<p>Her father either lives at a gas station or she made it all up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is not so much that dox is being removed (nearly all involved agree it should be), the issue is that entire discussion threads are being censored even if they contained no dox.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more frustrating, is that a mod of <a href="/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a> went so far as to contact the main actor involved on twitter before going on a censorship binge surrounding the topic.</p>

<p>This involves way more than this Quinn woman, it involves the gaming journalism industry manipulating content and that is why censorship fears are being peaked with regards to banning discussion of this story. </p>

<p>Personally, I think the mods are doing the best they can to control this mess.</p>

<p>The gaming journalism thing is messed up, but that&#39;s not news, it&#39;s been like this for a long time. The outrage right now is because of Reddit removing stuff, and I don&#39;t get why people are so shocked.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s certainly easier, but in this case it has done far more harm than any of the other approaches that could have been used to help curtail rule violations occurring during discussion of the issue.</p>

<p>What these mods have done is essentially brought the story to the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> with their approach; and if it&#39;s at the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> you can be damn sure its going to begin getting press way beyond the gaming circles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She is accused of cheated on her boyfriend with five guys, one of whom is a journalist that went on to write a favourable review of her game.</p>

<p>The author of the video has no issue with her personal life or cheating on her boyfriend as it&#39;s personal, and yet goes on a 10 minute rampage later about how unethical it is and what a terrible person she is for doing it.</p>

<p>Some of the others also tried to defend her on Twitter during the last few days. This the author also does not agree with. One of the other people she slept with was also married.</p>

<p>He brings up evidence to state she has a history of lying. This evidence involves images made in paint explaining how people on WizardChan did not prank phone call her sometime in the past.</p>

<p>He moves on to an example of she systematically ruined an organization trying to help women build games by turning the entire games journalism industry against them. The evidence for this is a single comment posted to <a href="/r/tumblrinaction">/r/tumblrinaction</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end he goes on a 5 minute tangent throwing insults at one of the person she slept with, and how they will be a failure in the future. Lots of swearing involved.</p>

<p>Finally he ends by accusing all of games journalism of sleeping with everyone for reviews. Lots of speeches about ivory towers, journalistic standards, and how we must rise up to prevent this from happening.</p>

<p>The one thing that is actually pretty important, and isn&#39;t just childish tat, is that she is also accused of having someone&#39;s video removed from YouTube on grounds of copyright infringement. The video was unfavourable about her game and the implication is that this is the real basis behind the claim, and so she is using the YouTube copyright system to censor others. That bit really is shitty, if true.</p>

<p>you might want to read up on the social effects of the unregulated industrial revolution on most of the population at that time. or just take a look at whats happening e.g. in china right now.</p>

<p>China is a Centrally-planned government that is shifting towards capitalism because they want to raise their standard of living and world financial position.</p>

<p>Capitalism is an economic system controlled by the civilian population, governments enforce regulation, you are confusing points to validate your misconception.  The marriage between government and corporate special interests is the threat, not the private sector alone.</p>

<p>History has proven unequivocally that capitalism creates more wealth for all of society than any other economic system.  Again, cronyism is not capitalism.</p>

<p>In light of recent events I will no longer be reading your website.  If one of your writers is in a private relationship with developer, writes stories about said developer, and does not disclose that relationship when they discus said developer how can I trust what they write?  How can I trust that there aren&#39;t other relationships that you are not disclosing?</p>

<p>Zoe Quinn is an indie <strong><em>game</em></strong> developer.  She is (allegedly) sleeping with <strong><em>gaming</em></strong> journalists in order to get positive press about her <strong><em>game</em></strong>.  Which in turn gives a false (allegedly) impression of that <strong><em>game</em></strong> to the <strong><em>gamers</em></strong> who read those <strong><em>gaming</em></strong> sites.</p>

<p>This is not related to gaming?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, go and actually read <a href="http://ohdeargodbees.tumblr.com/post/95188657119/once-again-i-will-not-negotiate-with-terrorists">her take on it</a> and then read a more <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/zoe-quinn-slut-shaming-the-feminist-conspiracy-and-depression-quest">neutral view</a> of what is happening. The latter article suggests that reddit mods are deleting posts that contravene reddit rules relating to private details, etc.</p>

<p>Nobody can point to the reviews she received as part of this corrupt conspiracy between her and a games journalist, because <strong>they don&#39;t exist</strong>. The sex might have happened, but there was no corruption.</p>

<p>A conspiracy is a secret plot to do something unlawful or harmful. There is nothing secret here - the problem if there is one is that this is all a private matter that should be private.</p>

<p>Except there is a conspiracy here to be discussed, but it&#39;s not the one many of you are prepared to see, because in this conspiracy, she is the victim. </p>

<p>Back in January <a href="http://www.edge-online.com/news/why-the-co-creator-of-depression-quest-is-fighting-back-against-internet-trolls/">Edge magazine pointed out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The warning came in an anonymous email: indie developer Zoe Quinn was to be the target of a forum-organised raid. Her game, Depression Quest (co-created with Patrick Lindsey and Isaac Schankler), attempts to give players some idea of what it feels like to live with depression, and is based on the personal experiences of the team. The game has attracted a great deal of attention, and even some awards, since its release. But despite surviving YouTube, Reddit and 4chan commenters with little trouble, the arrival of the interactive fiction game on Steam Greenlight in December 2013 proved problematic for certain members of one message board, triggering a disquieting chain of events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, before all of this, there was already a group trying to attack her because of the subject matter of her game?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe in Edge magazine&#39;s reporting. OK, from <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/130525-Depression-Quest-Dev-Faces-Harassment-after-Steam-Submission">Escapist Magazine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In response to developer Zoe Quinn&#39;s Greenlight submission, some users of imageboard Wizardchan harassed Quinn for her gender.</p>

<p>After the first Greenlight submission of Depression Quest, a piece of interactive &quot;(non)fiction&quot; seeking to enlighten players on depression, Quinn experienced similar sexist remarks. This time while anonymous posters of boards like Wizardchan harassed Quinn online, she also received sexually harassing phone calls. Quinn removed Depression Quest from Greenlight the first time she experienced abuse, but she will not be doing so this time.</p>

<p>Quinn included two screencaptures of comments on Wizardchan. Anonymous posters used slurs and said women cannot relate to anyone with depression, &quot;have no right to be depressed,&quot; and other degrading comments. After posters from Wizardchan found her phone number, Quinn had to change phone numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.themarysue.com/mighty-no-9-dina-abou-karam/">TheMarySue.com is a little more explicit</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the initial kernel of disagreement, the form the anti-Depression Quest outrage took was itself deeply misogynistic, and familiar to anyone who follows stories of internet harassment campaigns. Individuals shared around Quinn’s contact information, including her home address and telephone number, in order to send rape threats, misogynistic slurs, and even to call her up and masturbate into the phone. Because, as we all know, women don’t suffer from depression because “they can just go out into the street, lie down with their hole open and have any man come solve all their problems.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, ask yourselves what is really happening here.</p>

<p>Is it the case that the mods of the two sub-reddits have been &quot;compromised&quot; and that Zoey Quinn has deep connections on many websites that she is using to manipulate information concerning something that every person on the Internet has a right to know?</p>

<p>Or is it more likely that a bunch of forumites have been abusing her and leveraging information posted by a pissed off ex-boyfriend to make her life hell, and the mods are enforcing reddit&#39;s rules about posting personal information in as quick and efficient a manner as they can?</p>

<p>Is it more likely that she has decided to ignore the Streisand effect and is issuing takedown notices because the sheeple must not know, or that she believes ad hominem attacks against her by her ex-boyfriend should be private?</p>

<p>Is it more likely that one woman alone is successfully attacking free speech on various gaming forums, subreddits and youtube channels, or that her boyfriend has convinced 4chan it would be fun to shame, humiliate and upset her?</p>

<p>The conspiracy is not with the mods. It&#39;s right here. It&#39;s the people saying she&#39;s in the wrong for wanting her private life to remain private, that she is the perpetrator of a conspiracy rather than its victim.</p>

<p>Of course her boyfriend has rights, but they don&#39;t include the right to slut-shaming his ex-girlfriend and asking half the Internet to get in to the middle of their private disagreements.</p>

<p>Find me the game review that was exchanged for sex that heaps undue praise upon her and her game, point out the flaws in her own arguments that she has a right to a private life that is none of your business, convince me that what she did deserves people turning up at her house or harassing her parents, convince me that any takedown notice she may have issued is harmful to the public interest, convince me that mods aren&#39;t just protecting a woman who is a victim of a co-ordinated attack from a hoard of particularly nasty and juvenile men/boys, and I&#39;ll agree she is the perpetrator of the conspiracy rather than what I believe she is: the targeted victim.</p>
