    <div class="md"><p>The most likely explanation is that the US had nothing to do with the creation of ISIS. ISIS is another terror group trying to capitalize on a power vacuum in Iraq. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the sort of unfortunate thing that happens wherever there is a weak government; warlords and terrorists attempt to consolidate power. There really isn&#39;t a need to explain it with some grand convoluted narrative. It&#39;s a sad, shitty story already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Al-Qaeda/ISIS mercenaries are fueled by trafficking and piracy, not religion. They are mafiosi working for a global mafiosi state, that is in fact the anti-state that rules that great expanse conformed by the untended and invaded countries of the world: fields of maximal and unimaginable criminality are too profitable and power-creating to not exist in the present order. This is why the American aerial bombing of ISIS is all but symbolic and literally limited to one or two large guns in the latter&#39;s possession.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the guys who make guns always need something to shoot at. Look @ <a href="http://www.project.org/images/graphs/Spending_by_Catagory.jpg">this graph</a>. In the 80s it was the commies. When they fell apart, you had the 90s where you see this big dip in defense spending because there was nobody to kill. All of a sudden, you get the 2000s where Al Qaeda pops up. Now that Al Qaeda is pretty much dead with Bin Laden gone(he was the money behind the Al Qaeda), we need a new boogieman to kill.</p>

<p>The U.S/CIA/West are a bit like snake charmers. Eventually the snake will turn around and bite. The good news for the snake charmers is that they&#39;re the ones with the JDAMS. </p>

<p>Pump out 24/7 coverage about civilian beheadings and you get the public on your side (just don&#39;t mention the beheadings carried out in Syria. That doesn&#39;t fit the story).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the US government is not a monolith, but composed of many separate individuals working in different positions?  Maybe <em>some</em> of them conspire to further their own interests at the expense of the government, the American people, peace and our future.  Who wins?  Arms manufacturers, the shareholders of their stock, the people paid by them, the military and intelligence services get more public support, domestic issues are obfuscated, we have a pretext to project our military power to impress and coerce, we maintain a reason to dominate middle eastern affairs, etc.  Although, I have no evidence that ISIS is a creation or a facilitation from elements within the USA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory on the situation is that, every thing is going to plan. The Military industrial complex wants the US involved however it must be achieved. These groups are not given weapons to stabilize the Mideast, but to destabilize the region. Then the US govt plays it off like &quot;oh no we did it again, how does this keep happening, darn we are so stupid&quot;. The reality is The intelligence agencies that over see these operations are anything but stupid. </p>

Better change it back on 9/12. Or like the treasonous medical examiner at Sandy Hoax who changed privacy laws regarding child homicides prior to the &quot;massacre.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Creating a monster is an intelligence tactic.</p>

<p>If you have an enemy, you create or fund a competitor in the region to keep your enemy fighting in chaos without having to put troops on the ground. Eventually they become a problem for you,  but that gives you the opportunity to spend resources on taking fighting them. </p>

<p>Israel funded hamas to compete with fatah. The US funded mujahedeen to fight the soviet union. The DEA funds the sinaloa to fight the other mexican narco cartels. It&#39;s a similar concept to government involvement in drug trafficking- allowing them to play two sides and reap profits in both.</p>

<p>But the big plan for isis is to push through syria, lebanon and iran- where they will fight shiite armies like hezbollah. Its all pay of maKing sure those countries don&#39;t alley with asiatic russia as part of a BRICS world order. Also see AQ in somalia and sudan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US engages in many false flag creations and operations.  Those things that are created under false flag pretenses must continue to be played out as such in order for the intended victims of the false flag attack (i.e. citizens) to continue buying into the ruse.</p>

<p>In other words, if group A creates group B to attack group C and wants to look like a savior to group C, then after B attacks C, group A must then come in and &quot;save the day!&quot;  This usually involves group A directly fighting against group B (the very group they themselves created) so that they (group A) look like real honest to goodness saviors to group C and group C will then fully believe whatever falsehood group A intended the entire time.</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense.</p>
