    <div class="md"><p>I have major depression and anxiety; I&#39;ve recently started taking Prozac and it&#39;s made a huge difference in my life. I&#39;m starting to feel &quot;normal&quot;. I&#39;m not a zombie, zoned out in a drug fog that doesn&#39;t care about anything. Before turning to Prozac I tried for a long time to change my diet, I started exercising, I tried natural remedies with no luck what so ever. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a doctor or anything so I can&#39;t pretend to understand the whole fluoride in the medication I take so I&#39;ll have to find an explanation that I can understand, it is a bit worrisome that there&#39;s fluoride in something I put into my body daily. </p>

<p>Edit: Prozac has also helped during &quot;that time of the month&quot; I use to go borderline psychotic when I would PMS. Now, I&#39;m cool as a cucumber baby! </p>

<p>You say you <strong>recently</strong> started Prozac.  What happens when you&#39;ve been on it for a while and your body starts to adjust?  Do you think you will still feel &quot;normal&quot;?  What happens when you&#39;ve been on it for a while and you may need to suddenly stop?  Think you might go through some withdrawal?</p>

I&#39;m also doing cognitive behavior therapy so hopefully my body will do well and I&#39;ll be able to get off of it with no problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best of luck to you.  I&#39;ve dealt with some issues myself and absolutely refuse to take any anti-depressants.  Diet, exercise and just keeping busy helps me, but you said those had little to no effect on you so I can&#39;t tell you what will and won&#39;t work.  My only advice would be find any alternative that works other than prescription medicine.</p>

<p>There are if the case is extreme enough. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think that comes from thinking that natural=balanced and I totally get that. But it&#39;s observed that bodies and brains do not always function in a balanced way. Some peoples&#39; bodies produce too much dopamine when thinking of killing or molesting others. I wouldn&#39;t call that &quot;balanced&quot;. </p>

<p>Likewise, with depression, some people have too little dopamine or adrenaline or testosterone (or broken receptors), which create an imbalance. This is bad and can be fixed in many ways; through drugs, lifestyle changes or even just diet changes. It&#39;s up to the physician/psychologist/psychiatrist/trained professional to determine the cause and treatment. </p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s not like they created a drug to just kill people (well, except for lethal injection stuff). </p>

<p>But also realize that there are plenty of natural chemicals and toxins that claim lives every year (arsenic, uranium, mercury, etc). </p>
