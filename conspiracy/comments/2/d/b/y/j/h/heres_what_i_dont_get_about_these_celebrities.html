       Alright, here's my thing with these celebrities who supposedly die of circumstances "not related to TPTB or "star whackers" or the Illuminati". Here are the facts that have surrounded almost every celebrity that has died:
      </p>
      <p>
       Whitney Houston - died of "drugs" - ALONE in the bathroom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heath Ledger - died of "drugs" - ALONE in his home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phillip Seymour Hoffman - died of "drugs" - ALONE in his bathroom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jim Morrison - died of "drugs" - ALONE in the bathroom.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Carradine - died of "asphyxia" - ALONE in hotel room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael Jackson - died of "drugs" - ALONE in home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robin Williams - died of "asphyxia" (just like David Carradine - how ironic??) - ALONE in his home, was found/discovered, presumably by his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cory Monteith - died of "drugs" - ALONE in hotel room
      </p>
      <p>
       Kurt Cobain - died of "suicide" - ALONE in his hotel (no one believes Kurt committed suicide - at least not the smart people anyway.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Jimi Hendrix - died of "drugs" - ALONE in home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Janis Joplin - died of "drugs" - ALONE in her home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marilyn Monroe - died of "drugs" - ALONE in her home.
      </p>
      <p>
       River Phoenix - who died of "drugs" not ALONE but on the street, with his brother Joaquin who after his brother's death becomes HUGE star - how convenient?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anna Nicole Smith - died of "drugs" - ALONE in a hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amy Winehouse - died of "drugs" - ALONE in her home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brittany Murphy - died of "pneumonia" - ALONE in her room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, tell me this, why do ALL these stars all die alone? Most of them have died from the SAME damn thing, and there are many more I haven't even mentioned who have died ALONE from either drug abuse, heart failure or suicide. So you're telling me, everyone in Hollywood is going to die from either heart failure, drugs or suicide? Because apparently, that's what most of these stars under the age of 70 have died from. Something just doesn't add UP. So, when Meryl Streep, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney die, they're going to die from either heart failure, suicide or drugs too huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I keep telling people, Hollywood and the industry is like a gang, once you get in, the only way out is death. Robin Williams is dead because, there was something they - TPTB in Hollywood wanted him to comply with, he didn't, so they took him out. Just like all they did with all the stars I mentioned above. Randy Quaid isn't crazy, come on people, if you just stop and think about this, you'll see things don't make sense. Next, I guess if Matt Damon was to drop dead, people will say he died from heart failure and everyone will believe it. NO WAY. The same goes for Robin. YES, he had a past addiction, but that was NOT the cause of this man's death. When you join forces with TPTB and they tell you to do something and you don't do it, they will get rid of you and will make it look like an ABSOLUTE, tip top accident, heart failure death cause, drug OD death cause or suicide death cause. People better wake up because this shit is REAL. There IS a price to pay - not for wanting to be an actor, actress, singer, etc in Hollywood but for wanting FAME and FORTUNE in Hollywood....This won't be the last time we hear of another big celeb dying of supposed "drug OD", "heart failure" or "asphyxia"...There will be many more because the only time you're done with Hollywood and with your Hollywood career is when THEY - TPTB SAY they're done with you.....That's my take on all this.

       You could add Aaron Swartz to your list. There have also been several "surprise deaths" of high profile people in the UK in recent months (Rik Mayall, Mike Smith, Peaches Geldof).
      </p>
      <p>
       For most of these celebrity deaths, the official explanation is probably correct but some are them particularly sketchy. Whitney Houston "accidentally" drowned face down in a foot of bathwater. A bath that was so hot that it caused "skin slippage" on her corpse.

       I really think Whitney was murdered. Clive Davis may well be the creepiest person on the planet and the cold, maudlin way he kept the party going downstairs after finding out still gives me the creeped out shivers. You know the world is unjust when we lose someone like Whitney, but ghouls like Davis continue to haunt the earth.

       Who gets topped off on cocaine then falls asleep in a bathtub?
Falling asleep in a tub right after doing cocaine. Sounds like bullshit right?
You ever do some cocaine and then go to sleep 5 minutes later? Me either.

       Because most people take these drugs alone. And in Robbins case, people tend not to suicide  when theres other people around.

       Something about drug abuse and depression lends itself to being alone more often? If anything, it proves that dying alone addicted to drugs is a sad but consistent outcome for the world's best actors.

       It is an interesting thought and definitely worth looking into. But it's also worth mentioning that the things these people died of are things that typically can be survived as long as treatment is given. If they were not alone they probably would not have died because they'd have gotten medical treatment. So it's a bit of a circular argument.

       you can technically die from having too much money..since you can eat,drink,drug yourself to death...because you can afford it..but I guess you can also do that while poor..just with cheaper choices.  Maybe a tub full of coins, like uncle Scrooge...and can choke on a few gold coins?

       So all these celebs die of the SAME thing?? All of them? Why not die by a shooting or some other cause? Why is there a LONG line of celebs dying of the SAME thing in the SAME way? You don't find that - odd? AT ALL?

       You hopefully do realize there have been thousands of celebrities who did NOT die of drugs? Thousands of celebs died of natural causes, of accidents, of old age. You're singling out a small group here.

       No. Celebrities are generally wealthy people, so they're insulated from situations where they'd get shot, mugged, or generally attacked.  They also have great medical coverage, so they're less likely to die from disease or accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally they just die of old age, the reason you don't hear about it much is because by the time they're dying of old age, they're generally no longer in the public light or public consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       You only notice when celebrities that are still famous die, and generally that's going to be from a lifestyle related reason, and with the money and isolation celebrity can provide, the lifestyle is often going to be drugs or alcohol.

       You're spot on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus - normal people don't die of cocaine.  They can't afford to die of cocaine.  Hence, a lot of cardiac arrest in celebs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And heroin is a large cause of death in this country. We all know friends, family, acquaintances.  Rock and roll has always had tons of heroin in the scene and it's only a matter of time before you OD with heroin.  Maybe we can blame our government for turning an eye to the heroin smuggling industry a lot as they profit off it, but not for murdering these people and covering it up as drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, spot on about everything you said.

       As a long time healthcare employees(hospital and some ambulance time) here's a logical explanation for you based on what I've seen personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       People die alone because the vast majority of people will summon medical aid or perform CPR if they see someone overdose.

       People die alone because if there is someone there, they wind up calling help and the person gets saved.

       Example of someone being there to save them: Curt Cobain OD'd in Italy and would have surely died of it. Pat Smears was there, got him to the hospital, and they saved him.

       Well I think it's pretty obvious Cobain was murdered by that crazy bitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOWEVER, I completely agree with you.  Plus, in cases of suicide and depression, it's always alone.  Rarely does someone commit suicide in front of people.

       This is the problem with this subreddit often times.  Yes, not everything is as it seems and many conspiracy theories hold weight.  But a lot of people in here look at everything that goes wrong in society as "the government did it!" What about the other celebrities that did not die alone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Hicks - pancreatic cancer
      </p>
      <p>
       Frank Zappa - prostate cancer
      </p>
      <p>
       Corey Haim - heart disease and pneumonia
      </p>
      <p>
       Natasha Richardson - skiing accident
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael Duncan - heart attack (not alone)
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I can go on and on but you can't just take notable people that died alone and make up this shit neglecting all the ones that didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know WHY most of these people who died of drugs died alone?  Because generally, if you overdose with friends, they can take you to the hospital where they can monitor your vitals, revive you, pump your stomach, etc.  If you are alone and pass out - that's it.  Generally if you're dying of an OD, it's alone.  Also heroin is a dark horse - people don't only do it recreationally.  They're doing it alone a lot.  Most of the drug overdoses were heroin, and from people in music - where heroin is huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the "smart people" that know Kurt didn't commit suicide are the people that know Courtney did it.  How is that hollywood?  The same with Whitney Houston - while she may have been murdered it wasn't from the Zionist controlled Hollywood industry or whatever the fuck you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robin Williams struggled with depression and it's so fucking cold to come out this soon spewing this shit.  I truly, honestly hope that his death can open up people's eyes to the fact that is a real issue and people can't just "suck it up."  That's what he would have wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, "TBTB" surely don't give a shit about any of these people, I'll give you that.
