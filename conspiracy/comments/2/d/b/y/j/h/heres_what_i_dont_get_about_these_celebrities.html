        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alright, here&#39;s my thing with these celebrities who supposedly die of circumstances &quot;not related to TPTB or &quot;star whackers&quot; or the Illuminati&quot;. Here are the facts that have surrounded almost every celebrity that has died:</p>

<p>Whitney Houston - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Heath Ledger - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in his home.</p>

<p>Phillip Seymour Hoffman - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in his bathroom.</p>

<p>Jim Morrison - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in the bathroom.</p>

<p>David Carradine - died of &quot;asphyxia&quot; - ALONE in hotel room.</p>

<p>Michael Jackson - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in home.</p>

<p>Robin Williams - died of &quot;asphyxia&quot; (just like David Carradine - how ironic??) - ALONE in his home, was found/discovered, presumably by his wife.</p>

<p>Cory Monteith - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in hotel room</p>

<p>Kurt Cobain - died of &quot;suicide&quot; - ALONE in his hotel (no one believes Kurt committed suicide - at least not the smart people anyway.)</p>

<p>Jimi Hendrix - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in home.</p>

<p>Janis Joplin - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in her home.</p>

<p>Marilyn Monroe - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in her home.</p>

<p>River Phoenix - who died of &quot;drugs&quot; not ALONE but on the street, with his brother Joaquin who after his brother&#39;s death becomes HUGE star - how convenient?</p>

<p>Anna Nicole Smith - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in a hotel.</p>

<p>Amy Winehouse - died of &quot;drugs&quot; - ALONE in her home.</p>

<p>Brittany Murphy - died of &quot;pneumonia&quot; - ALONE in her room.</p>

<p>Now, tell me this, why do ALL these stars all die alone? Most of them have died from the SAME damn thing, and there are many more I haven&#39;t even mentioned who have died ALONE from either drug abuse, heart failure or suicide. So you&#39;re telling me, everyone in Hollywood is going to die from either heart failure, drugs or suicide? Because apparently, that&#39;s what most of these stars under the age of 70 have died from. Something just doesn&#39;t add UP. So, when Meryl Streep, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney die, they&#39;re going to die from either heart failure, suicide or drugs too huh?</p>

<p>No, I keep telling people, Hollywood and the industry is like a gang, once you get in, the only way out is death. Robin Williams is dead because, there was something they - TPTB in Hollywood wanted him to comply with, he didn&#39;t, so they took him out. Just like all they did with all the stars I mentioned above. Randy Quaid isn&#39;t crazy, come on people, if you just stop and think about this, you&#39;ll see things don&#39;t make sense. Next, I guess if Matt Damon was to drop dead, people will say he died from heart failure and everyone will believe it. NO WAY. The same goes for Robin. YES, he had a past addiction, but that was NOT the cause of this man&#39;s death. When you join forces with TPTB and they tell you to do something and you don&#39;t do it, they will get rid of you and will make it look like an ABSOLUTE, tip top accident, heart failure death cause, drug OD death cause or suicide death cause. People better wake up because this shit is REAL. There IS a price to pay - not for wanting to be an actor, actress, singer, etc in Hollywood but for wanting FAME and FORTUNE in Hollywood....This won&#39;t be the last time we hear of another big celeb dying of supposed &quot;drug OD&quot;, &quot;heart failure&quot; or &quot;asphyxia&quot;...There will be many more because the only time you&#39;re done with Hollywood and with your Hollywood career is when THEY - TPTB SAY they&#39;re done with you.....That&#39;s my take on all this.</p>

<p>For most of these celebrity deaths, the official explanation is probably correct but some are them particularly sketchy. Whitney Houston &quot;accidentally&quot; drowned face down in a foot of bathwater. A bath that was so hot that it caused &quot;skin slippage&quot; on her corpse.</p>

<p>Because most people take these drugs alone. And in Robbins case, people tend not to suicide  when theres other people around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is an interesting thought and definitely worth looking into. But it&#39;s also worth mentioning that the things these people died of are things that typically can be survived as long as treatment is given. If they were not alone they probably would not have died because they&#39;d have gotten medical treatment. So it&#39;s a bit of a circular argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No. Celebrities are generally wealthy people, so they&#39;re insulated from situations where they&#39;d get shot, mugged, or generally attacked.  They also have great medical coverage, so they&#39;re less likely to die from disease or accidents.</p>

<p>Generally they just die of old age, the reason you don&#39;t hear about it much is because by the time they&#39;re dying of old age, they&#39;re generally no longer in the public light or public consciousness.</p>

<p>You only notice when celebrities that are still famous die, and generally that&#39;s going to be from a lifestyle related reason, and with the money and isolation celebrity can provide, the lifestyle is often going to be drugs or alcohol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re spot on.</p>

<p>Plus - normal people don&#39;t die of cocaine.  They can&#39;t afford to die of cocaine.  Hence, a lot of cardiac arrest in celebs.</p>

<p>And heroin is a large cause of death in this country. We all know friends, family, acquaintances.  Rock and roll has always had tons of heroin in the scene and it&#39;s only a matter of time before you OD with heroin.  Maybe we can blame our government for turning an eye to the heroin smuggling industry a lot as they profit off it, but not for murdering these people and covering it up as drugs.</p>

<p>But yeah, spot on about everything you said.</p>

<p>People die alone because if there is someone there, they wind up calling help and the person gets saved.</p>

<p>Example of someone being there to save them: Curt Cobain OD&#39;d in Italy and would have surely died of it. Pat Smears was there, got him to the hospital, and they saved him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think it&#39;s pretty obvious Cobain was murdered by that crazy bitch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the problem with this subreddit often times.  Yes, not everything is as it seems and many conspiracy theories hold weight.  But a lot of people in here look at everything that goes wrong in society as &quot;the government did it!&quot; What about the other celebrities that did not die alone?</p>

<p>Bill Hicks - pancreatic cancer</p>

<p>Frank Zappa - prostate cancer</p>

<p>Corey Haim - heart disease and pneumonia</p>

<p>Natasha Richardson - skiing accident</p>

<p>Michael Duncan - heart attack (not alone)</p>

<p>I mean I can go on and on but you can&#39;t just take notable people that died alone and make up this shit neglecting all the ones that didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Do you know WHY most of these people who died of drugs died alone?  Because generally, if you overdose with friends, they can take you to the hospital where they can monitor your vitals, revive you, pump your stomach, etc.  If you are alone and pass out - that&#39;s it.  Generally if you&#39;re dying of an OD, it&#39;s alone.  Also heroin is a dark horse - people don&#39;t only do it recreationally.  They&#39;re doing it alone a lot.  Most of the drug overdoses were heroin, and from people in music - where heroin is huge.</p>

<p>Besides, the &quot;smart people&quot; that know Kurt didn&#39;t commit suicide are the people that know Courtney did it.  How is that hollywood?  The same with Whitney Houston - while she may have been murdered it wasn&#39;t from the Zionist controlled Hollywood industry or whatever the fuck you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>Robin Williams struggled with depression and it&#39;s so fucking cold to come out this soon spewing this shit.  I truly, honestly hope that his death can open up people&#39;s eyes to the fact that is a real issue and people can&#39;t just &quot;suck it up.&quot;  That&#39;s what he would have wanted.</p>

<p>However, &quot;TBTB&quot; surely don&#39;t give a shit about any of these people, I&#39;ll give you that.</p>
