<p>You say you&#39;re a realist, yet you&#39;re completely and vehemently opposed to those who only wish for people to think critically and to think for themselves, and to trust what can be factually verified.</p>

<p>What contrived talking point are you going to throw out next, &quot;you all believe the same nonsense theories&quot;?</p>

<p>WRONG. I do not believe anything we have been told about aliens is true, I have my own theories on what I believe to be an alien deception.</p>

<p>That&#39;s part of the problem. When someone argues a theory, they often get bashed and are called a &quot;troll&quot; or shill&quot;. Then they go to r/conspiratard. I thought this sub was complete free thinking and open conversation but I found out I was wrong pretty early.</p>

<p>Arguing, debating - these things have flow, logical presentations, sources where relevant, and a general nice exchange to them. Most trolls are ad hominem, lack logic, and detract or misinform.</p>

I disagree with his idea that the topic was likely made by conspiratard but I think I agree when he says he was being apathetic. I may be wrong but I feel like your response to him was more based on your history with him than the actual content of his post.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t pay too close attention to user names (although some stick out again and again) but a quick look at his history didn&#39;t give me the idea that he was a troll. (arguing with worldnews dummies against arms sales, sounds ok to me there)</p>

<p>There some obvious users who only post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and only say things negative about people&#39;s opinions and about articles posted. Obviously an alt they use just to argue here.</p>

<p>All of this is just my opinion after a quick look at what you asked me to look at. I may be wrong.</p>

<p>That comment does not apply to rule ten.</p>

<p>In the context, <a href="/u/freed3">/u/freed3</a> is suggesting that one possibility is more likely than another possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think <a href="/u/thefuckingtoe">/u/thefuckingtoe</a> may be on the front end of a force that tries to work for the good of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but I&#39;m not quite sure.</p>

<p>I have a theory that the core of reddit may actually be some type of government operation itself.</p>

<p>When you really think about it, and I&#39;m more than positive the government has, the best way to control everything is to control everything, duh, so control &quot;the front page of the internet&quot;, control reddit through a highly sophisticated network of accounts.</p>

<p>A network so advanced that it completely comprises every cell of reddit, a cell being defined as a topic, subject, or idea, such as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> , <a href="/r/nfl">/r/nfl</a> , <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> , and so forth and so on.</p>

<p>Control it all through a network of users that establish front end services for controlling all of the content.</p>

<p><a href="/r/nolibswatch">/r/nolibswatch</a> could be an inside operation controlled by the same groups that users like <a href="/u/jcm267">/u/jcm267</a> run, such as <a href="/r/conspiratard/">/r/conspiratard/</a> , he&#39;s a mod there and 38 other places, many of which serve the same purpose as <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> in one form or another.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s a strong possibility that the entirety of reddit could be controlled, top down, so as to ensure total control over it.</p>

<p>I would need a lot more actual proof and evidence to prove this, but it&#39;s a thought none the less.</p>

<p>IMO, it&#39;s just sad. I enjoy <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because even if I disagree with some or most of the theories at least this sub is free thinking and looks past any authority fed rhetoric to try to search for the truth. We are naturally cynical people who think there is more than meets the eye in most things, sometimes we&#39;re right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong again.</p>

<p>People freely thought that Sandy Hook was a hoax, and others freely think the actual truth in this one, which is that it was an actual real tragedy.</p>

<p>My current theory, is that the powers that be, since they spy on everybody, may have known about Adam Lanza and his plans to shoot up a school.</p>

<p>I think they may have purposely handled the investigation in a manner which makes the fabricated conspiracy theory look more legitimate.</p>

<p>&quot;OH LOOK AT THIS PHOTO, THEY&#39;RE WEARING ID BADGES, THESE 5 PHOTOS PROVE THEY&#39;RE ACTORS BECAUSE OF THAT FACT, THAT&#39;S NOT AN IRRATIONAL JUMP IN LOGIC BASED ON NO ACTUAL EVIDENCE.&quot;</p>

<p>I think the reason for this, was to make it so that their upcoming false flag event, &quot;Boston Bombing&quot;, is able to be revealed or not, for the hoax that it is.</p>

<p>I think they succeeded in pulling off that hoax, due to the Sandy Hook connection.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you think Boston Bombing was fake? What, do you think Sandy Hook was fake too? If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;ll think you&#39;re a crazy person and not listen to you.&quot;</p>

<p>The Boston Bombing was so filmed that it&#39;s extremely easy to prove how big of a hoax it was, the saw dust bombs coming from the store windows, absolutely no shrapnel damage to any surrounding structures directly next to the supposed pressure cooker backpack bombs, the completely false testimony of several key witnesses like mister Arandando who was filmed bending down with his little flag in his hand, which is when he took the opportunity to soak it in fake blood for the camera, the man who can be seen failing to attach Jeff Baumans prosthetic stump where you can clearly see him trying to put the strap over jeffs leg, which then breaks.</p>

<p>Boston Bombing was an obvious hoax that TPTB used for multiple purposes, mainly to see if they could enact martial law without having to declare it, which they did successfully.</p>

<p>So boom, fuck this bullshit <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> doesn&#39;t allow free thinking.</p>

<p>I just gave you my completely unique thoughts I came up with all on my own, nobody thought this shit up for me, this is what I think about these two incidents.</p>

<p>Free thinking as long as you have the balls to post it.</p>

<p>That happens on the whole site, it&#39;s not a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> exclusive problem.</p>

<p>9/11 is a BIG FUCKING DEAL, in case you haven&#39;t been alive since 9/11........</p>

<p>People on both sides feel VERY strongly, regardless of any evidence.</p>

<p>This is why you see ALL types of comments getting brigaded, because people are engaged in an information war, and willing to use dirty tactics to win it.</p>

<p>You do understand <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> right?</p>

<p>People are trying to talk about CRIMES that politicians are committing, things that should land people in jail, like people from the Federal Government.</p>

<p>Those people really don&#39;t want to go to jail, just like the CIA doesn&#39;t want you figuring out what covert operations they do.</p>

<p>This is why this place is targeted, and why other places trying to throw a wrench into the system get targeted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s exactly what they want. To many people, &quot;conspiritard&quot; does mean anyone that questions the status quo. Simply to acknowledge their existence is to acknowledge that they have relevancy and meaning. It is better to just downvote any post mentioning them positively, or giving them validity, and not respond to it. It&#39;s clearly just a desperate plea for attention, so attention is the one thing that they should never be given.</p>

It&#39;s a springboard for them to rally against our discussing of facts and truth.  You&#39;re absolutely correct.  Its beyond pathetic.  Though it proved just how dangerous we are to them.

<p>I&#39;d agree that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> contributes to a significant amount of their content, but that it&#39;s not a majority of the content. From what i&#39;ve seen this sub takes up on average about 20% of their front page.

    <div class="md"><p>I think <a href="/u/thefuckingtoe">/u/thefuckingtoe</a> may be on the front end of a force that tries to work for the good of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but I&#39;m not quite sure.</p>

<p>I have a theory that the core of reddit may actually be some type of government operation itself.</p>

<p>When you really think about it, and I&#39;m more than positive the government has, the best way to control everything is to control everything, duh, so control &quot;the front page of the internet&quot;, control reddit through a highly sophisticated network of accounts.</p>

<p>A network so advanced that it completely comprises every cell of reddit, a cell being defined as a topic, subject, or idea, such as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> , <a href="/r/nfl">/r/nfl</a> , <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> , and so forth and so on.</p>

<p>Control it all through a network of users that establish front end services for controlling all of the content.</p>

<p><a href="/r/nolibswatch">/r/nolibswatch</a> could be an inside operation controlled by the same groups that users like <a href="/u/jcm267">/u/jcm267</a> run, such as <a href="/r/conspiratard/">/r/conspiratard/</a> , he&#39;s a mod there and 38 other places, many of which serve the same purpose as <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> in one form or another.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s a strong possibility that the entirety of reddit could be controlled, top down, so as to ensure total control over it.</p>

<p>I would need a lot more actual proof and evidence to prove this, but it&#39;s a thought none the less.</p>
