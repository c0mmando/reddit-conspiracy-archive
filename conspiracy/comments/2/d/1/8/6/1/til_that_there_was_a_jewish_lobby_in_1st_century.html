         The next thing is that charge about the Jewish gold. And this, forsooth, is the reason why this cause is pleaded near the steps of Aurelius. It is on account of this charge, O Laelius, that this place and that mob has been selected by you. You know how numerous that crowd is, how great is its unanimity, and of what weight it is in the popular assemblies. I will speak in a low voice, just so as to let the judges hear me. For men are not wanting who would be glad to excite that people against me and against every eminent man; and I will not assist them and enable them to do so more easily. [67] As gold, under pretence of being given to the Jews, was accustomed every year to be exported out of Italy and all the provinces to Jerusalem, Flaccus issued an edict establishing a law that it should not be lawful for gold to be exported out of Asia. And who is there, O judges, who cannot honestly praise this measure? The senate had often decided, and when I was consul it came to a most solemn resolution that gold ought not to be exported. But to resist this barbarous superstition were an act of dignity, to despise the multitude of Jews, which at times was most unruly in the assemblies in defence of the interests of the republic, was an act of the greatest wisdom. “But Cnaeus Pompeius, after he had taken Jerusalem, though he was a conqueror, touched nothing which was in that temple.” [68] In the first place, he acted wisely, as he did in many other instances, in leaving no room for his detractors to say anything against him, in a city so prone to suspicion and to evil speaking. For I do not suppose that the religion of the Jews, our enemies, was any obstacle to that most illustrious general, but that he was hindered by his own modesty. Where then is the guilt? Since you nowhere impute any theft to us, since you approve of the edict, and confess that it was passed in due form, and did not deny that the gold was openly sought for and produced the facts of the case themselves show that the business was executed by the instrumentality of men of the highest character. There was a hundredweight of gold, more or less openly seized at Apamea, and weighed out in the forum at the feet of the praetor, by Sextus Caesius, a Roman knight, a most excellent and upright man; twenty pounds weight or a little more were seized at Laodicea, by Lucius Peducaeus, who is here in court, one of our judges; some was seized also at Adramyttium, by Cnaeus Domitius, the lieutenant, and a small quantity at Pergamus. [69] The amount of the gold is known; the gold is in the treasury; no theft is imputed to him; but it is attempted to render him unpopular. The speaker turns away from the judges, and addresses himself to the surrounding multitude. Each city, O Laelius, has its own peculiar religion we have ours. While Jerusalem was flourishing, and while the Jews were in a peaceful state, still the religious ceremonies and observances of that people were very much at variance with the splendour of this empire and the dignity of our name and the institutions of our ancestors. And they are the more odious to us now because that nation has shown by arms what were its feelings towards our supremacy. How dear it was to the immortal gods is proved by its having been defeated, by its revenues having been farmed out to our contractors, by its being reduced to a state of subjection.

       The Jewish Lobby was allied with Julius Caesar and later Octavian/Augustus, they started to lose influence when Tiberius became Emperor and expelled the jews from Rome because they defrauded a aristocratic Roman woman from Gold and Purple (the most valuable color of the time).
      </p>
      <p>
       But the jews always came back to Rome and remained influential even after the Judean revolts from 70 AD and 130 AD.

       Interesting. Mainstream history has Julius being funded by some vague nouveau riche element, which I've always assumed was the burgeoning tax collecting industry that simply exploded under Octavian. It never occurred to me that said industry would actually be Jewish usurers, which does make sense; I wonder if that is why he was murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it odd Tiberius hid away on his fortress island of Capri, despite ruling over the most effective and brutal police state Rome ever saw. Was it the long arm of the Jewish banksters he feared? And when he drug Pontius Pilate back in disgrace, was it really for all his murders; or did Pilate simply end up pissing off the same money changers Jesus did.

       So, that's why Rome crushed Judea, destroyed the Second Temple, &amp; renamed the region "Palestine". And here, I thought it was because Judea was rebelling against Roamn rule and occupation.

       Interesting. Mainstream history has Julius being funded by some vague nouveau riche element, which I've always assumed was the burgeoning tax collecting industry that simply exploded under Octavian. It never occurred to me that said industry would actually be Jewish usurers, which does make sense; I wonder if that is why he was murdered.

       I thought it odd Tiberius hid away on his fortress island of Capri, despite ruling over the most effective and brutal police state Rome ever saw. Was it the long arm of the Jewish banksters he feared? And when he drug Pontius Pilate back in disgrace, was it really for all his murders; or did Pilate simply end up pissing off the same money changers Jesus did.
