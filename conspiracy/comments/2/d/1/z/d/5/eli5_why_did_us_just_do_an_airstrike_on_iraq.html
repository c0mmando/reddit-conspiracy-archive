       Well it's pretty much politically impossible to get any Americans on board with us getting entangled in another ground war over there.  We'd need to rely on people already on the ground over there, like the Kurds, to do the fighting for us.  Even if we only surreptitiously arm them do destabilize the area further until it is such a mess that we'll have "no choice" but to go over there ourselves in a few years.

       FYI, "preventing a humanitarian crisis" was the same reason Obomber bombed Libya.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look now how most are cheering this 3rd Iraq incursion.  Murderers bombing murderers, but now Obama is doing it, and he's selling it better than Bush did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is sick, and now people are cheering this new made-for-mass-entertainment war, as the bad brown men (as sold by all the internet propaganda) are somehow worthy of pissing away U.S. money, extorted from the neighbors of those cheering the killing as the bombs drop.

       I want no part of this and don't think the growth of ISIS is without Western influence/support.  I think a lot of the weapons came from the U.S. trying to arm rebels to overthrow Assad in Syria last year.

       i think he's saying that yes, they are bad, but like the CIA-backed al qaeda, isis is just another pawn being used by western powers to further corporate agendas. as far as conspiracies go, this is one fairly rooted in history and its not a huge stretch of the imagination to believe that our propaganda machine is taking full advantage of the destabalization efforts created by our guys.

       No, I understand that during the Afghanistan-Soviet war in the 80's we funded the Mujahedeen fighters to push out the soviets. And that Bin Laden was apart of the Mujahedeens and subsequently went to form Al Qaeda. But saying that the CIA directly funded Al Qaeda is sensationalism

       they still do. stop living in the 80s when they downplayed everything from this to drug smuggling. its precisely idiots like you who still, even after hearing the truth, distort it just so you can comfortably stick your head back up your ass. have fun in there while the rest of us deal with reality.

       you're the one that so readily called it "sensationalism" while partially admitting my point. it's not my fault you decided to stick to your "sources" that are three decades old. and even then, you had to be brainwashed to accept the official narrative that tried hiding everything under the rug. have you not been paying attention, grandpa? i dont need to do your homework for you. stop being so pathetic. stop suckling big brother's teet and do your own goddamn research instead of parroting talking points you heard on fox and cnn.

       i am not sticking to sources that are 3 decades old. And "Grandpa"? there goes the name calling again. I'm probably younger than you... And sorry I don't circlejerk to every unverified source that's thrown in front of my face. By the way, don't pat yourself on the back by saying that I partially admitted to your point, because I didn't.

       edit: btw I do agree with you that there is absolutely American money in the hands of Al Qaeda, a lot of it that even comes from modern times. But I was merely saying that by saying that the CIA is backing Al Qaeda, as in intentionally funneling money into their hands like some sort of twisted Contra thing, is sensationalism.

       you mention the 80s as evidence that is supposed to show how sensationalist im being. wow, so if you werent even alive then why the fuck is it relevant at all to you? that makes you look even more pathetic, that you dont pay attention to whats going on in your own generation, you look back to a time you know nothing of to try to come off as being more knowledgable than you really are, because you are clueless as to how the world is currently moving. wtf do you think they just suddenly stopped their covert operations in the middle east because you were born? i refuse to source what is readily available to you, since you looked up shit from the 80s maybe you should expand your puny horizons more.

       Jesus Christ dude. I acknowledge the fact that there is still US money getting in the hands of Al Qaeda and other similar organizations. And why is this relevant to me? That's a pretty stupid fucking question for someone that just called me an idiot of keeping my head in my ass. I don't know where you got this idea that I think that the world stopped being in conflict after the 80's. I just used that as a reference because I assumed that's what you were talking about in the comment that provoked this little temper tantrum of yours. Never once in this entire thread have I denied the fact that there is still cover operations in the middle east. I don't need to look shit up because I know it already. You were just making a claim (I'll refrain from using sensationalist because I can see how riled up it gets you) that has no evidence and asked you to back it up.

       ISIS is not an enemy of the US, but rather another mercenary group we train and fund. We consider them disposable of course, so if they get in the way a few might have to die to keep the whole facade up. Small price to pay for global dominance.

       I read that part as "the war machine has conjured up an enemy that really poses no threat to us, but they will use as an excuse to spend US tax dollars". I don't think the emphasis was on the idea that they actually aren't total psychopaths, just that now were dropping missiles on people that shouldn't be our problem.

       So strategic military advantages outweigh the lives of civilians or any resemblance of policy consistency.  Gotchya.  The longer our countries propagate hypocritical rhetoric, the quicker our legitimacy disintegrates.  Like Obama's big, 'we need to protect whistle-blowers' speech, when in practice he has had more whistle-blowers arrested than any president before him.  This is going to chip away at the people's trust, be they American or citizens of foreign nations.

       I believe that genocide, in this context, means to attempt to wipe out an ethnicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The small, ethnically unique population of Christians in Iraq are at risk of utterly being wiped out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The immense population of Palestinians is not at risk of being wiped out, so it is not a genocide in progress.

       The reason being is the situations are completely different.  With Israel and Gaza you have to entities at war with each other.  Now Israel has done some pretty shitty things and I won't argue that.  However it isn't a genocide.  Neither is what is going on in Iraq.  However it could be considered ethnic cleansing.   Now the two are similar with one main difference, the goal.  With genocide there is only one goal in mind, the complete destruction of a group of people.  Ethnic cleansing is not that, it's more of trying to get the group of people to do want you want, whether it's to submit to your rule, leave an area, or in the current case the adoption of religion.  Everyone really needs to stop using genocide all the time.

       1) Israel is our ally (and also has the most Washington lobbyists); reasoning: we need them to allow us to use their country as a base of operations in the middle east
2) Preventing genocide is not in America's interest; protecting our strong ally Kurdistan from being invaded is; last time Obama wanted to use military power, American's yelled "Booooo!"; saying genocide typically sways public opinion enough (same reason President's staff never say genocide in situations we don't want to intervene in)

       Perhaps because what's happening in Gaza is not genocide? 
While America is bombing ISIS, why not do something about Syria, too?

       Genocide involves attempting to eliminate an entire group of people.  If by 'genocide in Gaza' you mean Israel is attempting to take out all rocket-launching terrorists as a discreet group, then I'd agree with your terminology.  And no, I don't recall President Obama being stopped from bombing Syria.

       Because what's happening in Iraq is a deliberate killing of civilians and ethnic cleansing. Look at the videos of entire villages exterminated or where the population was forced to flee on the mountains.
Although Israel has killed civilians during the fights, it was not on purpose. What Israel is doing may be an unfair war, but is not a genocide.

       When your enemy hides among the innocent and you solve all of your problems with a hammer, you're going to have a very high civilian death toll.  This isn't condoning their actions, but it's definitely understandable.

       Because the Palestinian civilians were non-combatants caught in the crossfires of an armed conflict. They weren't threatened with ethnic cleansing like the Yazidis, Shabak, or Assyrian Christians of Northern Iraq. I don't see how the two situations are remotely comparable.

       We're droning the shit out of a ton of Pakistani children right now. I hate the CIA drone program and it is literally a terror operation. It's not right when Americans do it and it's not right when Israel does it or anyone else does it either.

       Know what's irresponsible? Genocide. And that's what's going on. Because it's not Palestine that invaded Israel. It's Israel invading Palestine based on the official 1947 UN Partition map:

Hamas is shooting rockets into Israel-occupied Palestine. It's like if someone Chinese guy started building a house in your backyard. You go out to stop him and he says "Dude, if you keep invading China, I'm going to murder your kids." Fuck off Israel. The US and Israel are the two most hated countries in the world. I hope the US turns our back on Israel and just lets them fend for themselves out in the shitty part of the world they live in.

       Finally someone who can have a conversation on the matter without calling me a israeli shill....

       I agree with everything you said there man...except for the genocide part. I know Israel kinda is occupying land that isn't really theirs...but they aren't going around systematically killing every man woman and child palestinian they can....and this is what makes it not a genocide. Yeah civilians are dying and its horrible but this is literally what Hamas wants to happen...and if they didn't fire rockets from civilian areas this wouldn't happen. Its a shitty situation and Israel is doing some fucked up stuff but its not genocide.

       Also I don't know what people expect Israelis to do...would you be ok with native americans bombing our public schools because we stole their land?

       I dunno.  We do love to arm people to fight battles in our interests.  Granted they then usually use those same weapons against us and our allies, but hey, who's keepin track?

       No, I understand that during the Afghanistan-Soviet war in the 80's we funded the Mujahedeen fighters to push out the soviets. And that Bin Laden was apart of the Mujahedeens and subsequently went to form Al Qaeda. But saying that the CIA directly funded Al Qaeda is sensationalism
