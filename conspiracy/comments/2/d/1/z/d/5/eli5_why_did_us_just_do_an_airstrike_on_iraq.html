    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s pretty much politically impossible to get any Americans on board with us getting entangled in another ground war over there.  We&#39;d need to rely on people already on the ground over there, like the Kurds, to do the fighting for us.  Even if we only surreptitiously arm them do destabilize the area further until it is such a mess that we&#39;ll have &quot;no choice&quot; but to go over there ourselves in a few years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI, &quot;preventing a humanitarian crisis&quot; was the same reason Obomber bombed Libya.</p>

<p>Look now how most are cheering this 3rd Iraq incursion.  Murderers bombing murderers, but now Obama is doing it, and he&#39;s selling it better than Bush did.</p>

<p>The whole thing is sick, and now people are cheering this new made-for-mass-entertainment war, as the bad brown men (as sold by all the internet propaganda) are somehow worthy of pissing away U.S. money, extorted from the neighbors of those cheering the killing as the bombs drop.</p>

<p>I want no part of this and don&#39;t think the growth of ISIS is without Western influence/support.  I think a lot of the weapons came from the U.S. trying to arm rebels to overthrow Assad in Syria last year.</p>

<p>And no you don&#39;t need to do my &quot;homework&quot; for me. But when you make claims to things as big as this, please provide a source...</p>

<p>edit: btw I do agree with you that there is absolutely American money in the hands of Al Qaeda, a lot of it that even comes from modern times. But I was merely saying that by saying that the CIA is backing Al Qaeda, as in intentionally funneling money into their hands like some sort of twisted Contra thing, is sensationalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ dude. I acknowledge the fact that there is still US money getting in the hands of Al Qaeda and other similar organizations. And why is this relevant to me? That&#39;s a pretty stupid fucking question for someone that just called me an idiot of keeping my head in my ass. I don&#39;t know where you got this idea that I think that the world stopped being in conflict after the 80&#39;s. I just used that as a reference because I assumed that&#39;s what you were talking about in the comment that provoked this little temper tantrum of yours. Never once in this entire thread have I denied the fact that there is still cover operations in the middle east. I don&#39;t need to look shit up because I know it already. You were just making a claim (I&#39;ll refrain from using sensationalist because I can see how riled up it gets you) that has no evidence and asked you to back it up. </p>

<p>So PLEASE stop pulling shit out of your ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason being is the situations are completely different.  With Israel and Gaza you have to entities at war with each other.  Now Israel has done some pretty shitty things and I won&#39;t argue that.  However it isn&#39;t a genocide.  Neither is what is going on in Iraq.  However it could be considered ethnic cleansing.   Now the two are similar with one main difference, the goal.  With genocide there is only one goal in mind, the complete destruction of a group of people.  Ethnic cleansing is not that, it&#39;s more of trying to get the group of people to do want you want, whether it&#39;s to submit to your rule, leave an area, or in the current case the adoption of religion.  Everyone really needs to stop using genocide all the time.  </p>

<p>I know this will be downvoted because ISRAEL KILLS BABIES! and is GENOCIDAL!...but the only people saying this are people who haven&#39;t educated themselves on the whole situation. I don&#39;t understand how one can see what Isis is doing and compare it to Jewish people...I mean wtf are you guys on? Seriously?

<p>We&#39;re droning the shit out of a ton of Pakistani children right now. I hate the CIA drone program and it is literally a terror operation. It&#39;s not right when Americans do it and it&#39;s not right when Israel does it or anyone else does it either. </p>

<p>Know what&#39;s irresponsible? Genocide. And that&#39;s what&#39;s going on. Because it&#39;s not Palestine that invaded Israel. It&#39;s Israel invading Palestine based on the official 1947 UN Partition map: <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/mapstellstory.html">http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/mapstellstory.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is occupying land that officially belongs to the Palestinians. So when people say, &quot;Hamas is shooting rockets into Israel!&quot; Bullshit. Hamas is shooting rockets into Israel-occupied Palestine. It&#39;s like if someone Chinese guy started building a house in your backyard. You go out to stop him and he says &quot;Dude, if you keep invading China, I&#39;m going to murder your kids.&quot; Fuck off Israel. The US and Israel are the two most hated countries in the world. I hope the US turns our back on Israel and just lets them fend for themselves out in the shitty part of the world they live in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally someone who can have a conversation on the matter without calling me a israeli shill....</p>

<p>I agree with everything you said there man...except for the genocide part. I know Israel kinda is occupying land that isn&#39;t really theirs...but they aren&#39;t going around systematically killing every man woman and child palestinian they can....and this is what makes it not a genocide. Yeah civilians are dying and its horrible but this is literally what Hamas wants to happen...and if they didn&#39;t fire rockets from civilian areas this wouldn&#39;t happen. Its a shitty situation and Israel is doing some fucked up stuff but its not genocide. </p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t know what people expect Israelis to do...would you be ok with native americans bombing our public schools because we stole their land? </p>
