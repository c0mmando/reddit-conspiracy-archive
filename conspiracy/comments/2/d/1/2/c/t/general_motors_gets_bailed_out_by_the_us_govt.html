    <div class="md"><p>GM has been a political looting/fund raising machine for a while.  GM got government grants and loans prior to bankruptcy whose liabilities disappeared with the new GM.  Contract law was abrogated in the bankruptcy and the firm was given partly to the unions and the expense of bond holders.  A lot of the car sales post bankruptcy have been fleet sales to the government.  Also, I think the legal liability for the old GM cars was lost in bankruptcy, and now GM fixes them, but isn&#39;t liable legally injuries, crashes, etc. (pretty sure on the last one)</p>

<p>GM is a political animal of the government.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vox.com/cards/gm-car-recall/what-is-the-timeline-of-the-gm-recall-scandal">Time line of ignition switch recall</a> </p>

<p>note the coincidential 13 year gap between gm discovering the ignition switch problem (2001) and gm notifying regulators (2014).  Regulators, and the public, &quot;discover&quot; the defect just 2 months after the suspiciously timely sale 2 months earlier, Dec. 9th, 2013, of the last govt. owned gm stock .  I suspect the government knew and did nothing.  They didn&#39;t want to spoil their stock.  I mean, dealers were sent a bulletin in 2006.  The defect wasn&#39;t a secret.  Yet there&#39;s this display of theatrical outrage as the scapegoat ceo is grilled over not being more forthcoming.  The company faced bankruptcy.  Having the govt. nationalize a percentage of gm is a slippery slope away from free market capitalism.  The ignition switch recall, in, say, 2006, could have been the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back, the last nail in the coffin of a car company already receiving unprecedented help from the US taxpayer.  But gm isn&#39;t just another car company.  They are a military contractor, an employer, and a symbolic American success story.  The government isn&#39;t hiding its motivation to see gm succeed because bailout, and it certainly possessed the means and opportunity (NTSB can hardly be considered an independent entity).  I think blaming an incompetent GM is easier to stomache, but not the whole truth.  That said I&#39;m a hardcore born-and-bred 
 brand loyalist gm fan.  </p>

<p>Its not a justification either, it&#39;s just a reality. If me and you sat down to talk, shared a few beers by the grill, we would explain our points to each other a lot better to each other then posting on Reddit.</p>
