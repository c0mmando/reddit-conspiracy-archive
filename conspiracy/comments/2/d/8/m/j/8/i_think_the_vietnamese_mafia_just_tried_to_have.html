<p>Previous studies have identified a link between cannabis use and schizophrenia, but it has remained unclear whether this association is due to cannabis directly increasing the risk of the disorder. </p>

<p>Several clinical studies have shown that increased caffeine consumption can exacerbate schizophrenic symptoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Thank you. I have not vaporized in quite a while but AFTER the situation I did consume a lot of caffeine to stay awake while I took what I believe were necessary steps to protect myself. But I believe you are doing what is called reasoning from analogy rather than from first principles. I trust first principles reasoning much more.</p>

<p>EDIT: Realized you did not make a statement claiming I was schizophrenic, only provided articles for me to read. I apologize for claiming you did. Thank you for the information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to go to the FBI and take whatever evidence you have.  Not the police.  Then go to a lawyer and have him hold an affidavit by you of the whole story.  Based on your twitter it looks like you might think that you&#39;re exposing them and that when that happens all will be well and the bad guys will get arrested.  You&#39;re young, you get a pass for that.  But make no mistake:  life doesn&#39;t work that way, all the cops know who they are and what they do and they are frightened, they will never cross the Asian mafia.  Your best bet is to document what has transpired, report to the FBI, then drop this thing and move away.   Sorry kid.  </p>

Reviews all over YT so you can make sure you get a decent one.  Wear it everywhere, upload it to a cloud every night.  If you can get more get one that looks over the street in front of your house.

<p>Heres what you do. Get off the fucking computer if youre in another country go to the embassy and tell them there is a threat on your life. They will harbor you for a while, which should be enough time for you to get your evidence in order, if not demand that you be taken to your home country. If in the US go to the authorities, they will take your claim seriously and harbor you for the time being and contact the proper people, again more time to get your evidence in order. </p>

<p>In fact, you have clearly and completely demonstrated that you are manic.  There is no doubt.</p>

<p>The question is only: are you crazy manic?  Or did the Vietnamese mafia try to call you, kind of manic?</p>

<p>It&#39;s OK to be manic when crazy stuff happens to you.  Mania is a mechanism that gives us abilities.  What can be a problem is when mania generates thoughts that aren&#39;t true.</p>

My mind was racing and I&#39;m sure I looked crazy. But as soon as I decided on a course of action I was calm.

<p>When you are in real danger, becoming manic is an evolutionary advantage.</p>

<p>But I would caution you that some of the things you have written, e.g., Tweet the FBI and call in the Khan Academy, are so incongruous as to make me think that you should proceed with caution, under the assumption that you are mistaken.</p>
