Under Obama I have come to realize what a puppet the prez is because Obama furthered Bush&#39;s effed up policies. An Afghani woman I admire, Malalai Joya, taught me that its the CIA that runs everything. A new prez is like putting a new saddle on the same old donkey--it does&#39;t matter who is prez. Its gonna take a civil war for us to take this country back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not so sure Obama is 100% on board with the Zionist agenda. To hear Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh talk, Obama is thwarting the Zionist agenda at every opportunity. They seemed particularly miffed that Obama had the nerve to shut down commercial flights from USA to Tel Aviv in the midst of the alleged rocket fire coming from Gaza. Obviously this rocket fire wasnt enough of a threat to shut down the airport, which means it wasnt a threat at all.. 3 civilian casualties on Israeli side? And they like to criticize John Kerry too, for not rubber-stamping the genocide.</p>

<p>Theres lots of reasons to oppose the Obama agenda, but on this issue he seems to have gotten it right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I however do not do what I do for the upvotes. I have had an awakening over a year ago and all I have received has been push back. People demanding sources, or proof of how I know what I know. It is a mixture of the unexplainable (spiritual) and reading within this mindset or watching movies with this awakened mind. It is a higher consciousness. This is from a dude who was a lifelong atheist that has worked in computer science for 20 years. I was also highly egoic so now people think I am doing this for attention. This could not be farther from the truth, my whole life I was a Briggs-Meyers ENTP and now I am an INTP and no longer like being around people. I went from an extravert to an introvert.</p>

<p>What can we do to help people in your situation? </p>

<p>How do you view me, the average us citizen, merely trying to make sense of this all?  Do you think I am a bad person for not doing more then simply sitting at my computer typing and reading?  I feel like I should do more sometimes, but don&#39;t know how without resorting to violence, which I find morally unacceptable.   </p>

<p>Anything else you want to talk about i would be interested in, it&#39;s rare that I get a chance to legitimately talk to someone on the &quot;other side&quot;, even though we&#39;re truly on the same side.  Even gifted with the greatest communication tool known to mankind, the internet, all my peers want to do is post pictures of themselves, and talk about themselves, when we should all be reaching out and connecting like this, which I find truly depressing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, you kinda dropped off the map.  You ok?  Im kinda worried with all the new stuff going on.  Heres my old comment no need to answer if its too long. Be careful out there, my work has fox news on and they are calling for blood.  Referencing 9/11 every five minutes, calling for total war, it&#39;s like a sick parody of what news should be and it&#39;s really making me sad.  People will go along with what they say.  Stay strong.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.  You&#39;re very informative and interesting to talk to.  Please don&#39;t apologize for writing a long reply, I would love to hear more about what you think, what we can do, and what daily life is like for you.  </p>

<p>So the Arab Spring is not viewed as a legitimate social movement, but rather another in the long line of american/CIA imperialist shadow coups, similar to our actions in latin america during the 20th century?  Thats interesting.</p>

<p>How did Israel and KSA become so close?  It seems like they have such different foundational beliefs, most people in this country wouldn&#39;t believe they could work together, even though I fully believe it and it is obvious once your eyes are open.</p>

<p>The systematic destruction of history is so sad.  It&#39;s clear that this is merely a continuation of the crusades, and an attempt to wipe an entire culture off the face of history.  So much knowledge and interesting history we could be studying, instead we&#39;re burning the library of alexandria all over again. I don&#39;t know how to stop it.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t participated in any anti war demonstrations.  I was too young when we invaded Iraq, and ever since 2008 when Bush and Co looted our economy, everyone has been too busy trying to keep their house from being foreclosed to even consider protesting.  It&#39;s a non-option as far as I can tell, and people like me who even bring up the idea are literally mocked, hated, and called names.  What I am doing is similar to what you are doing, trying to finish my education so I can foment change and revolution from inside the system, rather then outside.</p>

<p>Writing to senators to demand change is widely known to do nothing, they don&#39;t even read the letters.  Organizing groups is impossible, because the country is so brainwashed, they would literally call us terrorists, and no one would come.  Even among my friends, males in their early 20&#39;s, they all want war in the middle east.  They hate you, and they don&#39;t even understand why.  No one would show up. This is how deep the brainwashing goes, the CIA has spent decades making it like this.  For a while, I considered violence against the government as an option to try and catalyze something in the minds of my peers, but I decided that the better course would be to finish my degree, like I said above, get a respected job, and then figure out how to change things. </p>

<p>Although I do talk about this informally every chance I get.  Before I deleted my facebook, I posted a lot of links to things like operation northwoods, MK Ultra, etc.  Everybody who knows me knows I think 9/11 was a false flag and that I fully support a violent uprising in this country.  I try every chance I get to spark something, anything, in the minds of my peers.  They all just care too much about their corporal, physical bodies, and creature comforts to consider it.  No one in this country has the slightest idea that there could be more to life then being comfortable at night, and having food to eat.  As long as the government keeps roofs over our head and food in the stores, I don&#39;t see how things could ever change.  They are truly masters at brainwashing. </p>

<p>Every time we get close to shifting opinion, for example with Israel vs. Gaza recently, they come up with some new distraction, this time being ISIS and the airstrikes on that mountain.  My countrymen want blood, they have been conditioned with violence 24/7 from the day they were born, and it has become an addiction.  TV shows constantly show people being murdered, and the only good guys anymore are cops/FBI.  When Bin Laden was &quot;killed&quot; (most likely he had been dead for years), you should have seen the way people acted.  Like animals baring their fangs.  They are programmed to act like this when the middle east is concerned.  Absolutely disgusting.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand this part:
&quot;the part where your peers want to show off day and night? The Lebanese society is suffering front that, too. It&#39;s not just a western problem. But in Lebanon and the region, the problem is more pronounced because it contrasts too much with the reality.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps you could clarify a little more?  I think what you mean is the rampant materialism and narcissism, which is ruining my country.  The generation below me, the one that has grown up with technology, has the greatest communication tool in the history of mankind at their fingertips, but all they want to do is talk about themselves and how cool they are.  It disgusts me and I thank god I grew up in the 90&#39;s before all that shit was so common.  </p>

<p>The thing is that they have pretty similar goals: expansion through terror. The &#39;funny&#39; bit is that the IS didn&#39;t include israel on its map... Ha. They both want to see Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and their History gone in flames - working hand in hand is a must for them to achieve this.</p>

<p>I think finishing your education is the best thing you can do right now! I know that it&#39;s very difficult to pay student tuition in the USA... good luck. </p>

<p>Yes this is the sad part. Their purpose is to kill and destroy, to save &#39;murica... Meh. People still believe that. And now with the IS thing, I bet this sentiment is even more common - I&#39;ve seen it on failbook. </p>

<p>Concerning the last paragraph: yes this is what I meant. This isn&#39;t solely a Western problem, it&#39;s a global problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely: my community views 9/11 as being an inside job carried by, first and foremost, the USA, in collaboration with their men in Al-Qaeda (Bin Laden was an agent, we know that and we consider it a fact). We see 9/11 as a two-fold excuse: </p>

<p>1) to make the American public live in fear of Arabs/Muslims (the two terms being interchangeable for the masses around the world; in fact, they&#39;re very distinct!) and basically everything that isn&#39;t like them (Americans);
2) to be used as an excuse for military action in the region (9/11 is therefore also a false flag.</p>

<p>The USA suffered 9/11 and since then, has made the Middle-East, which had nothing to do with 9/11 to start with, hell on Earth. From Afghanistan (&#39;we must kill Bin Laden!&#39;) to Iraq (&#39;Saddam is now the bad guy plus, ya know, Iraq has weapons of mass destruction). And then the &#39;Arab Spring&#39;: Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Syria, Lebanon. And the Islamic State... Myself and many others do think that all of this has been possible because of both the West&#39;s involvement and the presence of traitors in the governments of the different countries (and also a complacent population). </p>

<p>Israel and KSA are BFFs. The KSA is exporting terrorism throughout the whole region (9/11 until now). They even sent prisoners (in prisons for criminal charges) to fight in Syria... And ISIL in Syria and Iraq is mostly made up of foreign fighters from KSA, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, the USA (yup...), Scandinavia... </p>

<p>Creating ISIL was by Israel, the USA, KSA and other entities. Fanaticism helped, of course. But KSA and co supplied the money and weapons etc... Add to that fanaticism and you have the perfect recipe for disaster. They are systematically destroying our History. They&#39;re burning everything, thus serving the interests of Israel and co. This is why from the very first few days we (some of us anyway) felt that the Arab spring was a lie. A genuine revolution is based on love and has principles... None of the revolutions the region has witnessed had those two primary characteristics.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t want help from the USA because &#39;American help&#39; = more wars... We were doing well, many many years ago. We were okay. Not super well, but okay. We were able to live dignity, something that we can&#39;t seem to have anymore... Maybe with no more wars hanging on our head, we will be able to deal with our problems (fanaticism and sectarianism being the two major ones). As long as there are wars, both aforementioned problems will be perpetual, without any chance of being solved. The best thing you, and others, can do is to demand to your government to stop meddling in other countries&#39; affairs (and deal with your domestic issues, I hear there are plenty :/). </p>

<p>As long as you are actively seeking to know more, even if it&#39;s behind a keyboard, I have respect for you. I don&#39;t hate you, I don&#39;t view you as the enemy, I don&#39;t hold grudge. Have you organised meetings to talk about pressing issues for example? Have you participated in anti war demos? Have you put pressure on senators? </p>

<p>I really think the USA needs a revolution but seeing how things are going, it won&#39;t be any time soon... I think what is missing for the US public is to see that &#39;the others&#39; in the middle east are human, too. We have our dreams, we are educated, we have our History, we have our dignity, we fall in love, we go to the movies, we joke, we play video games, we read, we are the same as you are. Maybe if the public stops seeing us as &#39;them&#39; (in &#39;us&#39; vs &#39;them&#39;), things will change. </p>

<p>This has gotten quite long but I wanted to add: the part where your peers want to show off day and night? The Lebanese society is suffering front that, too. It&#39;s not just a western problem. But in Lebanon and the region, the problem is more pronounced because it contrasts too much with the reality.</p>

<p>A last point: I suggest you get twitter, where people like me are constantly tweeting about topics like the ones we already mentioned! :D</p>

<p>If there&#39;s anything you&#39;re curious about, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask! And sorry for the novel :P</p>

<p>I was married and went to Ireland on my honeymoon back in 2011. Someone once asked me about 9/11 on that trip...even then I thought it was a bunch of bullshit and told some people there. They seemed surprised by response. Not sure if they bought the official story over there or if they simply expected me to be brainwashed, but it made me feel a strange sort of pride and no one I talked to there about stuff like that questioned my sanity.</p>

<p>I do not know if this will surprise you or not , but being (what is considered to be) a conspiracy theorist in almost any European country does not bare the same &quot;burden&quot; as I get impression it does in USA </p>

<p>For example if you say that 9/11 is an inside job (hypothetical example - works with any other conspiracy) on your work place , nobody will consider you to be some &quot;fringe lunatic&quot; or &quot;crazy&quot; or whatever (am not good with english terms used to throw shit on conspiracy theorist) </p>

<p>So there is that </p>

<p>Also - maybe out of context but still interesting - An American I used to work with here (he was working for an organization that educates people about free elections - through transition periods from communism to democracy in Eastern Europe and Balkans) once told me that &quot;the only American you can talk to about any global related topics is an American that traveled outside of USA at least once&quot;</p>

<p>Now while I am aware that he was not 100% correct (nobody really is) , his opinion was still very interesting to me </p>

<p>People in the Middle East who hate America can take solice in the fact that Americans are committing national suicide, led on by the Jews who are acting as America&#39;s Jack Kevorkian. The United States will not survive much longer in its present form. It is rotten to the core now, and the American people rejoice in its rottenness. They are so far gone, they cannot be instructed to save themselves. They eagerly hug their suicide to their chests and swallow the poison the Jews pump out through the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is going to downvote hell, but truth usually is.</p>

<p>Reading the comments here from my fellow Americans is sickening. </p>

<p>First, stop apologizing for what the U.S. is doing. You are not responsible for the choices the new Romans make, but you are responsible for your response to those actions. Imagine you befriended a playground bully and went around apologizing to everyone he punched in the face. You don&#39;t do that shit. By apologizing and trying to make his actions seem &quot;alright&quot; or &quot;amendable&quot; all you are doing is enabling that bully. The correct response is to punch that fucker in the face and make him stop terrorizing every God damn kid on the playground.</p>

<p>Second, those of you who give up on the generation who doesn&#39;t get it are not &quot;awake&quot;. You are &quot;aware&quot;, but are still lying in bed smashing the snooze button refusing to get up when the damn alarm clock has been going off for an hour. Grow some balls and defend your views, even if you have to &quot;speak down&quot; to another&#39;s level. Tell them you&#39;re ready for a revolution. Tell them about the atrocities without giving names of places or people. Describe the action. This is how a typical conversation goes:</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, what do you think about a city who cuts off water to 150,000 people?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Glad I live in America and not some third world middle eastern country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? Because I was talking about Detriot...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? Really?&quot;</p>

<p>or another</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, what do you think about murdering children during war time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God damn terrorists, when will they stop?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, somebody should tell the U.S. military to only shoot armed combatants and not kids.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, what?&quot;</p>

<p>Stop bitching about how the media mind controls people when you can present THE TRUTH using the same tactics. Only, you don&#39;t have to be scummy about hiding information.</p>

<p>Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. And those of you not taking actions to correct this &quot;I give up I&#39;m sorry&quot; attitude are the ones making peaceful revolution impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you there. It was even more obvious when there was a surge of about 50k users months ago, although I can&#39;t remember why (was r/conspiracy featured somewhere?). Content quality took a hit, BUT there was also a lot of people with common sense who did join in the posts about 9/11 and chemtrails and stuff. Questions were asked and discussion was stronger than before the influx. So maybe that was a double-edged sword.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree. Though the topics in the subreddit are by definition conspiracy- the word has is generally used to describe wild non-factual fantasies, cooked up by paranoid neck beards. By discussing these, very real concerns under the title of &quot;conspiracy&quot;, it allows people to employ lazy scepticism, disregarding issues of immense importance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this is how it&#39;s actually seen here in this sub but outside of it, it has a very very bad connotation. Others tend to focus on pointing out the negative connotation instead of focusing on the content of the info provided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never had an intelligent reason to get a twitter account. I might now. Thanks for your response. It&#39;s good to hear some confirmations from someone that has a perspective which is outside of Western propaganda and is much closer to the locations most in conflict. </p>

<p>I was married and went to Ireland on my honeymoon back in 2011. Someone once asked me about 9/11 on that trip...even then I thought it was a bunch of bullshit and told some people there. They seemed surprised by response. Not sure if they bought the official story over there or if they simply expected me to be brainwashed, but it made me feel a strange sort of pride and no one I talked to there about stuff like that questioned my sanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response.  You&#39;re very informative and interesting to talk to.  Please don&#39;t apologize for writing a long reply, I would love to hear more about what you think, what we can do, and what daily life is like for you.  </p>

<p>So the Arab Spring is not viewed as a legitimate social movement, but rather another in the long line of american/CIA imperialist shadow coups, similar to our actions in latin america during the 20th century?  Thats interesting.</p>

<p>How did Israel and KSA become so close?  It seems like they have such different foundational beliefs, most people in this country wouldn&#39;t believe they could work together, even though I fully believe it and it is obvious once your eyes are open.</p>

<p>The systematic destruction of history is so sad.  It&#39;s clear that this is merely a continuation of the crusades, and an attempt to wipe an entire culture off the face of history.  So much knowledge and interesting history we could be studying, instead we&#39;re burning the library of alexandria all over again. I don&#39;t know how to stop it.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t participated in any anti war demonstrations.  I was too young when we invaded Iraq, and ever since 2008 when Bush and Co looted our economy, everyone has been too busy trying to keep their house from being foreclosed to even consider protesting.  It&#39;s a non-option as far as I can tell, and people like me who even bring up the idea are literally mocked, hated, and called names.  What I am doing is similar to what you are doing, trying to finish my education so I can foment change and revolution from inside the system, rather then outside.</p>

<p>Writing to senators to demand change is widely known to do nothing, they don&#39;t even read the letters.  Organizing groups is impossible, because the country is so brainwashed, they would literally call us terrorists, and no one would come.  Even among my friends, males in their early 20&#39;s, they all want war in the middle east.  They hate you, and they don&#39;t even understand why.  No one would show up. This is how deep the brainwashing goes, the CIA has spent decades making it like this.  For a while, I considered violence against the government as an option to try and catalyze something in the minds of my peers, but I decided that the better course would be to finish my degree, like I said above, get a respected job, and then figure out how to change things. </p>

<p>Although I do talk about this informally every chance I get.  Before I deleted my facebook, I posted a lot of links to things like operation northwoods, MK Ultra, etc.  Everybody who knows me knows I think 9/11 was a false flag and that I fully support a violent uprising in this country.  I try every chance I get to spark something, anything, in the minds of my peers.  They all just care too much about their corporal, physical bodies, and creature comforts to consider it.  No one in this country has the slightest idea that there could be more to life then being comfortable at night, and having food to eat.  As long as the government keeps roofs over our head and food in the stores, I don&#39;t see how things could ever change.  They are truly masters at brainwashing. </p>

<p>Every time we get close to shifting opinion, for example with Israel vs. Gaza recently, they come up with some new distraction, this time being ISIS and the airstrikes on that mountain.  My countrymen want blood, they have been conditioned with violence 24/7 from the day they were born, and it has become an addiction.  TV shows constantly show people being murdered, and the only good guys anymore are cops/FBI.  When Bin Laden was &quot;killed&quot; (most likely he had been dead for years), you should have seen the way people acted.  Like animals baring their fangs.  They are programmed to act like this when the middle east is concerned.  Absolutely disgusting.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand this part:
&quot;the part where your peers want to show off day and night? The Lebanese society is suffering front that, too. It&#39;s not just a western problem. But in Lebanon and the region, the problem is more pronounced because it contrasts too much with the reality.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps you could clarify a little more?  I think what you mean is the rampant materialism and narcissism, which is ruining my country.  The generation below me, the one that has grown up with technology, has the greatest communication tool in the history of mankind at their fingertips, but all they want to do is talk about themselves and how cool they are.  It disgusts me and I thank god I grew up in the 90&#39;s before all that shit was so common.  </p>

<p>Write more, your words are needed.</p>
