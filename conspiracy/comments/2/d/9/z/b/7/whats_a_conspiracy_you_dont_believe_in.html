    <div class="md"><p>The Jewish history is covered.  What I was able to discover; there was a tribe called the Khazars that adopted the Jewish faith as a political maneuver (no love).  These Khazars make up most of the Jewish population, but only a very few of them know their true heritage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a handful of these Khazars that are responsible for most of the world&#39;s problems.  True Jews are wonderful people, and most Khazars are also capable of being good, but they have been lied to about their past, and believe it is their place to steal from the Palestinians.  They are also being used, some may think worse than most, as they are being manipulated to murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha no no no. Not at all.</p>

<p>I meant he asked some questions that made me wonder things. For instance, he referred me to a picture that <em>supposedly</em> was at ground zero, with concrete buildlings all destroyed and whatnot, and then there was this little wooden shack, complete with its roof and walls and even the door. It looked like it went through a decent sized fire, but it looked plenty of times better than what surrounded it. </p>

<p>Made me wonder, if this picture is legit and not just some random photos from some random ghetto, how does physics explain an atomic bomb destroying concrete buildings but not a wooden shack?</p>

<p>Like I said, it made me wonder. But not for very long. I like to be open minded and give folks a chance to explain themselves, but my attention span seems to be gettting worse as I get older and pack on more gmo&#39;s around my waistline...</p>

<p>This the former claim, it&#39;s less a contest of their existence, but more to the actual damage it caused and some other questions that are important themes in the official narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disbelieve in most of the popular conspiracies, as they are generally presented to the public. It&#39;s obvious that Israel was involved in 9-11, but that fact is obscured by the crazy conspiracies that are floating around (many of them spread, I believe, by Israeli and probably American propaganda). The most obvious nutty 9-11 conspiracy is that the buildings were brought down by planted explosives. Anyone who believes this (a) has no shred of common sense, and (b) is instantly relegated to the fruitcake category by the majority, and rightly so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trolling, I&#39;m genuinely curious why everyone&#39;s opinion is equal. Some people are just stupid. I don&#39;t mean that to be inflammatory, it&#39;s simply a fact (not talking about you specifically here either, just speaking generally). So why, in your opinion, should their beliefs based on faulty logic or backwards thinking be allowed to be screamed from the mountaintops? It&#39;s harmful to society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of that is pretty common sense but what exactly do you think happened on September 11th? Some &quot;terrorists&quot; with box cutters actually pulled all of that off while leaving their passports in perfect condition a block away from the towers? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, except the passports found were not in perfect condition.  You act like they found the passports of every one of the terrorists and all in perfect condition.  This could not be further from the truth.  One passport was found near the WTC and it was in pretty bad shape.  This was the one for Satam al-Suqami.  Two other passports were found in the field where United 93 crashed.  Neither in perfect condition.  A final passport was found for Abdulaziz al-Omari in luggage that did not make it on board the flight at all.</p>

<p>In other words, quit making shit up.</p>

<p>Sorry, ain&#39;t buying it.  That needle in a haystack wouldn&#39;t have survived the fireball AND been found on the ground outside the WTC within the 45 minutes before the Towers fell.  How fucking absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?  Do you realize how often intact debris is found after a plane crash?  It happens all the time.  Hell, they found a US flag after the Challenger space shuttle explosion intact in a flimsy plastic container.  </p>

<p>From the Columbia space shuttle explosion, which exploded FORTY miles above the earth, they found an intact experiment canister (glass and plastic), that contained worms.  Small worms.  All were intact and, surprisingly, the worms were even alive.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they found other intact debris spread all over the place after 9/11.  Including a mileage card from United Airlines, intact photos, pieces of mail.</p>

<p>The single passport that was found quickly, was found as debris was still raining down around the WTC.  It was found by a man who turned it in to a New York police officer.</p>

<p>But, an even better question is simply:  Why would they bother? What does it add to the story? There was no need to “plant passports”. We’ve never seen anyone say “they must have been on the planes because look, the NYPD found that passport”. It’s completely unnecessary, and is only ever used as evidence of an “inside job”.</p>

<p>The above quote was from: <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/passport_recovered.html">http://www.911myths.com/html/passport_recovered.html</a></p>

<p>which goes into much more detail.  But they didn&#39;t NEED the passport if they were going to &quot;fake&quot; the attack.  They had DNA, they had surveillance footage.  They had tons of other evidence.  They had no need of a fake passport.</p>

<p>Theres a lot of possibility out there, and even a drug called scopolamine which makes you highly suggestible (if it doesn&#39;t kill you) and leaves you with no memory of the events that occurred while under its influence
Its popular with scam artists in Columbia and the CIA experimented with it during MKUltra but found it to be too unpredictable.
