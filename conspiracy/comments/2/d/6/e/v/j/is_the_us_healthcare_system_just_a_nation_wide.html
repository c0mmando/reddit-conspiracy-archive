        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Like the title says, is the US healthcare system just an insurance scam?</p>

<p>Think about it. We are forced to pay for health insurance because healthcare costs an exorbitant amount of money. Medical centers can get away with charging such exorbitant amounts because they know that insurance will cover some(if not most) of what they charge. If any other service tried to charge their customers those kinds of fees, they&#39;d quickly go out of business because nobody would be able to afford to pay them. Actually, many countries medical centers(even the ones without national healthcare) charge their patients a fraction of the price US medical centers charge for the exact same services. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m overlooking something, but it looks like a conspiracy to me.</p>

<p>Look at how proper developed nations handle healthcare and you&#39;ll see how utterly ridiculous the US is comparatively.</p>

<p>All it would take to fix our healthcare system would be to take a mere fraction of our &quot;defense&quot; budget and put it into healthcare instead.</p>

<p>Most Americans I meet here are convinced that &quot;Obamacare&quot; or a single payer system is somehow not a good thing. And to be fair, it isn&#39;t, not for the people who have the money and want to cut in line ahead of people who can&#39;t afford it.</p>

<p>I guess the problem with socialized health care might be that the rich old man, and the poor old man, get treated the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the money wasted on war we could easily expand our healthcare infrastructure to support both the rich and the poor.</p>

<p>When it comes to human beings treated for diseases, why should their wealth play a factor in it? If it is due to congestion in the system we need to resolve that for <em>everyone</em>.</p>

<p>I believe our collective taxes should cover healthcare costs for everyone, entirely. The bigger problem is the racket that is healthcare. Look at the costs for insured versus uninsured, it&#39;s a completely arbitrarily priced system. Saline bags being charged as $100+ medical supplies...</p>

<p>I can&#39;t agree more, but a percentage of your American compatriots would call you a socialist, and derail the argument on that alone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not right at all, but it is politics. If more people thought like you, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were watching the &quot;negotiations&quot; step by step in 2009-2010, it was absolutely unbelievable how the Obama administration sold us out.  Step by step.</p>

<p>Then, instead of keeping their promises, they employed shills to delete comments and shout down voters on the nets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they played the blame game, blaming the republicans, yet Obama couldn&#39;t even be bothered to campaign for Kennedy&#39;s vacant seat in MA to save the supermajority.</p>

<p>That said, posts like this that question the one-party US political system will be buried with the recent reddit vote obscuration.  If the public hears that Democrats are the same as Republicans... well, we can&#39;t have that.</p>

<p>Healthcare costs so much in the States because insurers and healthcare providers are autonomous here. Other nations negotiate rates with pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals in bulk. </p>

<p>In America each provider network and pharmacy buys for their needs. The American companies are horrible at negotiations for costs and have less bulk buying power. By forcing us to buy insurance it does nothing to help with the underlying problem of fragmented healthcare industry. </p>

<p>As Americans what do we do? </p>

<p>Nationalize healthcare and negotiate better costs to bring down out of pocket expenses?</p>

<p>That&#39;s socialist many argue but we&#39;re talking about life saving products. </p>

<p>Or do we force everyone to buy insurance removing all incentives for insurers to compete by negotiating lower drug and treatment costs? </p>

<p>Well shit... That&#39;s what the ACA did...</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t force insurers to negotiate lower costs like their foreign counterparts do. It didn&#39;t force healthcare professionals to form unions that could give them leverage to buy in bulk and lower costs... </p>

<p>No the ACA forced citizens to pay for a product with the promise of insurers lowering costs because of the government mandated purchase of their products and subsequent higher profits to said companies...</p>

<p>Well shit...</p>

<p>Sure as hell sounds like a conspiracy to me. A conspiracy to increase governments scope and power while increasing private business profits... Fuckin fascist conspiracy to boot...</p>
