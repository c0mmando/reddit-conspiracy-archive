       Gaza is the test lab for civilian oppression. Israel develops its equipment and techniques on the people of Gaza, then exports those techniques to US police via training. Think of them as the US/UK/EU government's R&amp;D arm.

       There is an Israeli documentary call Hamaabadah (The Lab) that shows how the Israeli arms industry is doubling in size roughly every few years and generates nearly 10 billion in revenue annually. Police forces come from all over the world to train with the Israelis and learn their methods because of their experience with urban warfare. The use of experimental weapons by the IDF (e.g. DIME) have been alleged by the Norwegian doctor who was there recently. With billions of dollars in profits at stake, I can't imagine the Israelis having a perfect natural laboratory such as Gaza and not using it. The globalist anglo-American-Zionist empire have already shown their willingness to use their highly militarized police forces against peaceful protestors (G20, WTO, Ferguson, OWS). That seems to be the way of the future for dissenters in all countries. There are countless examples of corporate interests trumping the rights of people and of people who are willing to participate in cruel acts against other people in order to profit from it. Gazans are obviously being slowly genocided through the severe restriction of movement and resources into and out of Gaza. Early Zionist founders repeatedly wrote of the need to ethnically cleanse the resident Arabs from the land and the Israeli propaganda has propped up the lie that it was the Arabs that were the aggressors. In order to maintain this lie, Israelis have been brainwashed that Palestinians are subhuman savages and not worthy of moral consideration. Therefore, it is not at all hard to imagine that Gaza could be viewed as a natural testing ground. With this kind of inhuman treatment of them, killing them and using experimental weapons and methods on them doesn't seem to be an issue. So yes your hypothesis seems quite plausible. One thing I found rather touching was Gazans tweeting to residents of Ferguson on how to deal with tear-gassing. Almost brought a tear to my eye (no pun intended).

       You can't get much better than hearing it from an ex Israeli soldier. The last 10 mins were very very good.

       I've been feeling the same way about Detroit - water and sanitation shutdowns - , and now obviously Ferguson with militarized police. Proving grounds to see how much they can actually get away with before the big rollout.
