<p>Supposedly..
And you can count it here: <a href="http://members.home.nl/7seas/radcalc.htm">http://members.home.nl/7seas/radcalc.htm</a></p>

<p>But as I showed here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaSE4JDsu4bu5ztFM-oeocqQbCggp3nPmeOWE4xmIiQ/edit?hl=pl">The hoax of refraction and angular declination of the horizon</a></p>

<p>You can not count this way. </p>

<p>Simply typing the height of Mt.Everest would mean that...<strong>there is no land around the peak, but...sea</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s how people are being taught though. Starting from the age of 14:</p>

<p><a href="http://illuminations.nctm.org/Lesson.aspx?id=2493">http://illuminations.nctm.org/Lesson.aspx?id=2493</a></p>

<p><em>Now ask students to imagine what it would be like to stand on the top of Mount Everest, which is 29,035 feet above sea level. Ask them, &quot;How far do you think you&#39;d be able to see to the horizon if you were standing at the summit of Mount Everest?&quot; Allow students to speculate, but do not offer opinions about their estimates. Explain that the focus of this lesson is for them to attempt to answer that question</em></p>

<p><em>To conclude the lesson, allow students to explore the Distance to Horizon applet. This tool allows the user to adjust the height above sea level, and the distance to the horizon is calculated. The height can be adjusted to exactly 29,035 feet, the height of Mount Everest. At this height, the applet shows that the distance to the horizon is 208.8 miles. Students can use this value as a check of their results.</em></p>

<p>And here are the future results of such brainwashing:</p>

<p><em>For example, if you stood atop Mount Everest (which is 29,029 feet, or 8,848 meters tall), the horizon would be about 230 miles (370 km) away.</em></p>

<p>There&#39;s no hoax here. The formula you presented is designed to calculate the visibility of the horizon at sea, and that&#39;s exactly what it calculates. It provides a close approximation for the distance of the horizon inland, but that&#39;s not what it&#39;s designed to calculate. We already discussed <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Skycentrism/comments/2c13ne/skycentrism_part_xiii_sweers_formula_hoax_more/cjd5q8o">how to modify the formula to account for uniform ground elevation</a>. Obviously the ground around Everest isn&#39;t uniform in elevation, so even that modification would still just give a (closer) approximation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know, but neither do you, because the answer to that question can&#39;t be found with a simple, grade school level formula. To find the real answer, you&#39;d need the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The complete height map of all the terrain around Everest.</li>
<li>A record of the atmospheric conditions for the day you&#39;re interested in (because of the high elevation and corresponding large change in atmospheric density between ground level and the peak, refraction will play a large role in this case).</li>
<li>Which direction are you facing? The horizon will be a slightly different distance in every direction, due to the different terrain elevation and atmospheric conditions in each direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, 14 year old students are typically taught the &quot;tangent to sea level&quot; abstraction because it&#39;s very simple, gives relatively accurate results in the majority of cases, and provides a useful lesson on the geometry of triangles. Students in an upper year university course on optics would probably be taught more accurate ways of answering this question. There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with this. 14 year old students are not equipped with the mathematical tools to answer this question accurately, nor is it really useful to spend huge amounts of time trying to teach them such tools. It&#39;s the same reason we still teach the Neils-Bohr model of the atom, despite it being a simplified abstraction of quantum mechanics, and the same reason we still teach Newtonian physics, despite it being a simplified abstraction of relativistic physics. These simplified abstractions are accurate enough for the vast majority of cases, and the more complex models can&#39;t be reasonably taught without also teaching university level mathematics.</p>

<p>Bullshit, that&#39;s how it&#39;s calculated, that&#39;s what the sources I provided claim :) From youngsters toward adult idiots.
Your claims that the line of our sight changes depending on what the terrain looks like is even funnier :) You&#39;re not smarter, you&#39;re equally stupid :)</p>

<p>This video has a couple obvious errors. First, you&#39;re assuming the observer is at a height of 2m, when this is not actually documented anywhere. Second, it&#39;s not really possible to tell if the entire base of the windmill is visible with the low resolution of that image.</p>

<p>You realized it was a failure and removed this information.</p>

<p>3.You say the resolution is poor...and we can&#39;t know that the windmills are seen from their base. Oh, we do. The horizon is clearly behind the first row of windmills, which means that we can see the bases of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So the height is 16 m ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily. Let me show you how to derive this. The visibility of an object at sea can be calculated by:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ha = Viewpoint Height (in km)</p></li>
<li><p>Hb = Target Height (in km)</p></li>
<li><p>R = Radius of Earth (in km) = ~ 6378 km</p></li>
<li><p>Visibility = sqrt(2 * R) * (sqrt(Ha) + sqrt(Hb))</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If we want to calculate the heights that would allow a visibility of 14.5 km, we can rearrange as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Visibility / sqrt(2* R) = sqrt(Ha) + sqrt(Hb)</p></li>
<li><p>14.5 / sqrt(2 * 6378) = sqrt(Ha) + sqrt(Hb)</p></li>
<li><p>0.12838 = sqrt(Ha) + sqrt(Hb)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, if the square roots of Ha and Hb add up to at least 0.12838, then the visibility distance of 14.5 km is possible. For example, let&#39;s consider a case where the shore is at an elevation of 2m, the observer is 2m tall, and the point they&#39;re observing is 5m up the base of the windmill. In this case:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ha = 0.002 km + 0.002 km = 0.004 km</p></li>
<li><p>Hb = 0.005 km</p></li>
<li><p>sqrt(0.004) + sqrt(0.005) = <strong>0.13396</strong> &gt; 0.12838</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, the visibility should be greater than 14.5 km when our two heights are 0.004 km and 0.005 km. Let&#39;s confirm:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Visibility = sqrt(2 * 6378) * (sqrt(0.004) + sqrt(0.005))</p></li>
<li><p>Visibility = <strong>15.12 km</strong></p></li>

<p>Keep in mind that those windmills are 160 meters tall from base to blade tip, and that 5 meters of the base would appear as less than 2 pixels in your image. With the image resolution that low, you can&#39;t say with any confidence that the entire windmill is visible.</p>

<p>No. Elevated terrain effectively changes the radius of the Earth in the horizon distance calculation, and it does impact the result slightly.

    <div class="md"><p>...to make me think about what? I feel your delivery for whatever revelation you believe you are disseminating is fairly poor. But I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>What does it matter if the horizon is 230 miles or 208 miles (visibly) atop Mt Everest? Does this imply some nefarious agenda to disallow people the analytical ability to calculate the distance to horizon as if it matters or is important in everyday life? </p>

<p>I feel that a bigger, more important, and parallel topic is common core. Of which this submission of yours could be categorized if this is what is being taught, and if you could explain it&#39;s significance. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see why this is important to discuss or even dwell about. We could just as easily be discussing the distance to the moon, which is also variable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read them. I have a problem with their claims, though. They keep saying that the horizon is at eye level when observing the horizon. Whether that is at the vbeach or on top a mountain, they claim it is still eye level. But this is nonesense. It just looks that way because we cannot perceive the slight difference in angularity. </p>

<p>The percent of change of the angle to the horizon as we go higher in elevation is so slight we do not see a real difference whether we are at zero meters above sea level, or a thousand meters. We don&#39;t perceive this difference. It&#39;s like the fact that the the stars in our sky are constantly moving, at a very fast rate of speed btw, yet they are so far away that we do not perceive their individual motion relative to us. The fact that we don&#39;t or can&#39;t perceive this motion is not proof that this motion does not exist. </p>

<p>Same thing with the horizon. </p>

<p>So, I read your links, it would only be fair to read mine. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absence_of_evidence">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absence_of_evidence</a></p>

<p>Check out the section titled, &quot;Distinguishing absence of evidence from evidence of absence&quot;. </p>

<p>Your links are rife with this logical fallacy. It basically assumes that since we cannot visually perceive the difference of angles of large distances relative to our size, that the seemingly insignificant difference of angularity is negligable, and therefore does not have a need to be applied to the equations. This is ignorant of a few very fundamental principles of math and physics and science in general. </p>

<p>Your argument is flawed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understood it alright. I understood that the claims you are making (implied from your history as well as the information contained in your links) are flawed in that it discounts the change of angularity of the horizon from the observers point of view as his elevation changes. This is explained in the link I provided, if you ever bother reading it.</p>

<p>In addition to this logical fallacy that is inheritantly adopted within your claim, if your claim were to be true, then we couldn&#39;t have possibly gone to the moon, or put satellites into space, and the international space system couldn&#39;t possibly exist. The moon and the stars and the sun, everything celestrial would not actually exist. The knowledge in regards to astronomy and geology and geometry and agriculture derived from all ancient peoples  to this day would have to be considered wrong in favor of this one new theory that dictates this much. It is preposterous to even consider this theory as plausible. </p>

<p>Not only that, but all the knowledge of the seafaring peoples regarding navigation, as well as the topographists who create maps, from ancient times to this day, would all have to go with everything listed above. Furthermore, GPS would not work the way it does, satellites wouldn&#39;t work, hell, even radio transmissions wouldn&#39;t be effective if your claim were to be true.</p>

<p>So, on one hand is the cumulative knowledge of ancient and modern times alike. On the other is this single theory that ignorantly takes the use of a logical fallacy and ignorantly dismisses all evidence to the contrary as support for its foundation. </p>

<p>I am actually embarressed that I have wasted this much effort on this. This theory is worse than the flat earth theory, imo. At least the flat earth theory was proposed by people who didn&#39;t know any better and didn&#39;t dismiss massive amounts of evidence to the contrary (speaking of its emergence as a theory, not in more recent times after it was proven to be false...)</p>

<p>The issue is not with my comprhension of math, physics, geometry, trigonometry, or anything like that. The issue is with the logical fallacies that are smothering the logical faculties of the proponents of this theory.</p>
