       Its weird how there are a bunch of videos of the plane's smoldering wreckage, but none of these Ukrainian fighter jets flown by invisible pink unicorns. One would imagine a single Ukrainian would've noticed and taken a video similar to this:

       M8, your whole theory rests on the assumption that's fighter jets shot the plane down.
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole theory is based on the fact that the rebels were pictured and videotaped operating SAM launchers in the area and had previously shot down a few military cargo planes. The phone taps from the Ukraine security services. The posts on VK by rebels that were talking about shooting down a plane on that same day (now conveniently deleted).
       <a href="http://www.corriere.it/esteri/14_luglio_22/cosi-stato-colpito-l-aereo-0a7e5f9e-115f-11e4-affb-3320a03d21e8.shtml">
        This article in an Italian paper
       </a>
       that interviews a rebel who admits they mistakenly shot down the plane because they thought it was a military plane with paratroopers in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which stands up to scrutiny better?
      </p>
      <p>
       If your actually interested in both sides of the story, I've done quite a bit of research on the topic and would be happy to provide links once I get on my computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS, you dodged the question.  Why doesn't the Russian defense ministry just release the sattelite photos of the plane getting shot down?

       Your theory is based on the facts you chose to take at face value which defined a narrative pumped out by the Western/Ukrainian interest that has a stake in the race. At the same time, you turn a blind eye to the Russian side that also has a stake in the race.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am looking at both sides equally and not turning a blind eye to either side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have already heard the evidence you listed, it has been shouted from the ends of the Earth by the Western media. While they were shouting it, they were also telling everybody not to listen to the Russian side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why doesn't the US release their satellite photos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why doesn't the Ukraine release the Air Traffic Controller tapes?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the questions you should be asking instead of proudly proclaiming that you have figured it out by using the "facts" that were fed to you (and millions of other people on the planet) by a media with a proven history of lies and manipulation.

       Otherwise known as "abductive reasoning"? I'd recommend you try it, if you ever awake from your persistent vegetative state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has refused to submit any satellite evidence of MH17. Why? The AAIB and the Dutch Safety Board appear to be gagged, and the western media is turning the other way after having whipped up a storm of baseless anti-Russian sentiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the people who have the evidence are reluctant to release it, the logical conclusion is that the evidence implicates them or a close ally.

       Man, this thread was jumped on quick by the naysayers and the downvote brigade.

      <p>
       I think they use MH17 as a keyword.

      <p>
       Its amazing how quickly they can come in and ruin a thread. No actual discussion just "hurr durr, but the official story is true".

       Did you miss the part where the Western media started pumping out "news" the second the crash happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you miss the part where they tried
       <em>
        so hard
       </em>
       to present "evidence" that was completely laughable to anyone with a brain?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you miss the part where they vehemently said over and over again that they could prove Russia did it?

       I would trust a random civilian's liveleak video of a jet firing on the plane.

       Why doesn't those photos contain the plane actually getting shot down?
