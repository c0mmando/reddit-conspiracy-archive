<p>Letters to the Editor
New York Times
December 4, 1948</p>

<p>TO THE EDITORS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:</p>

<p>Among the most disturbing political phenomena of our times is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the &quot;Freedom Party&quot; (Tnuat Haherut), a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties. It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.</p>

<p>The current visit of Menachem Begin, leader of this party, to the United States is obviously calculated to give the impression of American support for his party in the coming Israeli elections, and to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States. Several Americans of national repute have lent their names to welcome his visit. It is inconceivable that those who oppose fascism throughout the world, if correctly informed as to Mr. Begin&#39;s political record and perspectives, could add their names and support to the movement he represents.</p>

<p>Before irreparable damage is done by way of financial contributions, public manifestations in Begin&#39;s behalf, and the creation in Palestine of the impression that a large segment of America supports Fascist elements in Israel, the American public must be informed as to the record and objectives of Mr. Begin and his movement. The public avowals of Begin&#39;s party are no guide whatever to its actual character. Today they speak of freedom, democracy and anti-imperialism, whereas until recently they openly preached the doctrine of the Fascist state. It is in its actions that the terrorist party betrays its real character; from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future.</p>

<p>Attack on Arab Village</p>

<p>A shocking example was their behavior in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. This village, off the main roads and surrounded by Jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off Arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. On April 9 (THE NEW YORK TIMES), terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants ? 240men, women, and children - and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem. Most of the Jewish community was horrified at the deed, and the Jewish Agency sent a telegram of apology to King Abdullah of Trans-Jordan. But the terrorists, far from being ashamed of their act, were proud of this massacre, publicized it widely, and invited all the foreign correspondents present in the country to view the heaped corpses and the general havoc at Deir Yassin. The Deir Yassin incident exemplifies the character and actions of the Freedom Party.</p>

<p>Within the Jewish community they have preached an admixture of ultranationalism, religious mysticism, and racial superiority. Like other Fascist parties they have been used to break strikes, and have themselves pressed for the destruction of free trade unions. In their stead they have proposed corporate unions on the Italian Fascist model. During the last years of sporadic anti-British violence, the IZL and Stern groups inaugurated a reign of terror in the Palestine Jewish community. Teachers were beaten up for speaking against them, adults were shot for not letting their children join them. By gangster methods, beatings, window-smashing, and wide-spread robberies, the terrorists intimidated the population and exacted a heavy tribute.</p>

<p>The people of the Freedom Party have had no part in the constructive achievements in Palestine. They have reclaimed no land, built no settlements, and only detracted from the Jewish defense activity. Their much-publicized immigration endeavors were minute, and devoted mainly to bringing in Fascist compatriots.</p>

<p>Discrepancies Seen</p>

<p>The discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by Begin and his party, and their record of past performance in Palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. This is the unmistakable stamp of a Fascist party for whom terrorism (against Jews, Arabs, and British alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a &quot;Leader State&quot; is the goal.</p>

<p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, it is imperative that the truth about Mr. Begin and his movement be made known in this country. It is all the more tragic that the top leadership of American Zionism has refused to campaign against Begin&#39;s efforts, or even to expose to its own constituents the dangers to Israel from support to Begin.</p>

<p>The undersigned therefore take this means of publicly presenting a few salient facts concerning Begin and his party; and of urging all concerned not to support this latest manifestation of fascism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A quote from a speech he gave in 1938:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustainâ€”especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smart guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A little extra info. During the time of the British administration of Palestine, Menachem Begin was wanted by the British authorities for (get this) being a terrorist. I also remember he later became the Prime Minister of Israel back in the late 1970&#39;s.</p>

<p>In one of the great ironies of our time, he signed a peace treaty with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat at Camp David in 1978. They later shared the Nobel Peace prize for doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub really needs to change it up a little. How about a pro-Zionist conspiracy? Here&#39;s a crazy conspiracy theory:</p>

<p>Zionist are actually just nationalists who want to live in Israel.</p>

<p>Try that one on for size. Oh... uh... The Jews don&#39;t want you to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s because r/conspiracy has been flooded, lately, with pro police, pro Israel and/or pro government shills, trying to undermine this sub reddiit. They&#39;re making racist accounts against Jews to later point out as a low point of this sub reddit. Mock sincerely question &quot;was hitler a nazi?&quot;. Or threatening the White House with &quot;our brave sea-of-fedoras&quot;.</p>

<p>Petty and childish tactic, serving a sinister motive of hiding the truth, or at least the harming legitimacy of its search and debate.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind being downvoted for it though, if it means this sub automatically downvotes those clowns.</p>
