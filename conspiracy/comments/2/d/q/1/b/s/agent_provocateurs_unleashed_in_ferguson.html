        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Watching a LiveStream last night, here&#39;s how the events unfolded.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Militarized police reappeared, stirring up an uneasy crowd. They threatened all protesters that they would be &quot;subject to arrest and/or other actions.&quot; This made everyone uneasy, since they had already fired off tear gas earlier in the night.</p></li>
<li><p>Several young men joined the crowd and start to hype them up. Jumping around, starting chants, singing &quot;We Ready&quot; to the police, etc. It was pretty obvious these guys were looking for a fight, not just holding their ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Suddenly a large number of cars appear (even though the streets were previously empty) and looters start pouring out to destroy local stores.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though militarized police are nearby, and probably become quickly aware of the situation, they stand down. They never advance towards the crowd.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the protesters are now caught in a whirlwind. The police are threatening them, as well as the looters, and in addition, the looters are eroding the image of the peaceful protest. They band together to stop the looting, since the police have actively refused to do so.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very obvious event by an agent provocateur. Likely multiple agents, but the same situation nonetheless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An agent provocateur (French for &quot;inciting agent&quot;) is an undercover agent who acts to entice another person to commit an illegal or rash act or falsely implicate them in partaking in an illegal act. An agent provocateur may be... employed by the police or other entity to discredit or harm another group (e.g., peaceful protest or demonstration) by provoking them to commit a crime - thus, undermining the protest or demonstration as whole.</p>

<p>Because as far as I know...nobody is looting during the day. Lets get him out there with them during the night and see what happens.
Looting one night, SWAT and the &quot;militarized&quot; police show up and you hear nothing of looting. They send those guys home and like magic, looting starts again.</p>

<p>Starting to look like the &quot;militarized&quot; police did a great job in stopping property damage and items being stolen. Which has been my stance all along, they look scary and they keep people in check because of that. Guess it looks like I was right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a St. Louis resident who has been following this very closely since the beginning and long-term <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> reader, let me share my own thoughts. I don&#39;t think this is a case of agents provocateur, at all. The residents of Ferguson, by and large, are peacefully protesting in the streets. The looters, by and large, are scum of the lowest order from neighboring communities and from across the river in East St. Louis in Illinois. They are taking advantage of the situation to get free rims, cheap beer and and hair weaves. The locals last night on the stream were successfully defending several stores from looters, the liquor store couldn&#39;t be controlled though. The reason they have out of state plates are they are either from Illinois, are stealing plates from other cars (confirmed multiple times via police scanner that tags were not matching the make/model of the car they were on) so people can&#39;t get their tag, or using rental cars which are more likely than not to have out-of-state plates from all over the U.S.</p>

<p>The cops around here want calm and peace, this whole deal is a huge black eye to their forces and to the city/state as a whole. These looters are straight up thugs, not trained undercover operatives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be more willing to believe that it wasn&#39;t a planned event if the police had acted against the looters. Instead, they shot peaceful protesters, and watched idly by as looters destroyed property and stole goods. </p>

<p>Really the least malicious thing was that the police ignored looting because it was helping them discredit protesters, in a case of &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend.&quot; But that also meant they were abandoning their primary mission - to protect and serve the public. The most malicious thing is that police staged the whole deal, which would implicate them as conspirators (or at least accessories) for grand larceny and destruction of property.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the reason the police did not intervene is it would have only made the situation worse. Tensions are very high and there is a lot of cop-hate right now around here. The past few nights there have been people with rifles and shotguns driving around shooting aimlessly, some rock and glass bottles have been thrown at police. It wouldn&#39;t have been a pretty sight last night if the cops intervened with the looters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There wouldn&#39;t be looting if the police hadn&#39;t shot an unarmed kid and then acted like children when trying to resolve the problem.  Nothing adult happened, just more violence.  Some &quot;person&quot; makes the decision to send in those police in riot gear and rifles.  That&#39;s what they want.  They don&#39;t send councilors or whatever to solve the problem.  They go to the gun, right away.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t that bother you?  Don&#39;t get me wrong, deal with looters as you have to but APC&#39;s and body armor to deal with these problems is overkill.  It&#39;s conditioning.  </p>

<p>I think this could have been resolved much easier if they just basically outright apologized and owned up for their mistake, if it was.  Do the adult thing right out for everyone to see and shock the shit out of everyone.  I know they wouldn&#39;t have a reason to riot if the PD was on TV apologizing and such.  Doing the right thing?  I think it can be done.  Pay some dollars to the family, let them be on their way as best as possible.</p>

<p>Instead they give them EVERY reason in the world to riot.  Provoking them.  They&#39;re willing to create the problem.</p>

<p>You make it sound like if the police weren&#39;t around all the time, everyone would just riot.</p>
