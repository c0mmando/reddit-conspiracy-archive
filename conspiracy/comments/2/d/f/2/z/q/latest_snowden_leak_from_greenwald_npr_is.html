        First AP and now this. There’s a lot of people in media who make mistakes, are ignorant or are simply pushing an agenda. But attacking other media this way is getting very Alex Jones-ish. It’s a point well-taken and worth noting, but hardly worth an article this big.
        <strong>
         Anyone in the know already knows NPR is a government mouthpiece
        </strong>
        . People who don’t still aren’t not going to get it no matter what you say. Alex Jones is bigger than these NPR and AP people in terms of his reach. What about investigating him? Lots of rumors out there that he works for the government and Stratfor. Wonder if it’s also just attack or if it’s true. You want to really hit a raw nerve, look there.

       jones is the most obvious Mossad agent out there. but that doesn't mean he's not right 90%+ of the time. He will point you in the right direction.

       There is no form of media without an agenda behind it. If you don't personally know the author of an article or a blog, NEVER assume that the information being presented to you is 100% accurate.

       that's why i only
       <em>
        really

       listen to the words of people who have been killed after disclosing facts. not that I believe everything they said, but i'm sure that

       Bill Cooper and Phil Schneider are the only two that I know of that fit this profile. cooper described 9/11 on 6/28/01; that utterly convinced me he knew what he's was talking about;

       Michael Hasting clearly got to see some high level documents, too bad he either didn't have a dead man's switch or it didn't work.

       Dr. Steven Greer is another man that i pay attention to. He and his research partner both got cancer a few weeks after giving their first presentation to Congress members.

       How so? I'm genuinely curious because NPR's reach extends pretty far amongst those that aren't actively buying into conspiracy. A big article like this should finally put the nail in the coffin on MSM being biased and untrustworthy in the eyes of non-conspiracy believers.

       Their excellence and usefulness lay in fooling people into thinking they are a reputable source for news that exercises journalistic integrity.
      </p>

       But no, NPR is (overt or covert, depends who's judging) state propaganda in America.

       I made this comment yesterday on a duplicate post:
       <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2dc8dp/npr_is_laundering_cia_talking_points_to_make_you/cjo9uyo">
        http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2dc8dp/npr_is_laundering_cia_talking_points_to_make_you/cjo9uyo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a follow-up post I reiterated the fact that "NPR" is an umbrella organization for 900+ individual stations, and that it has about as diverse a funding pool as you'll find (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR#Funding">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR#Funding
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm genuinely curious if anyone has other info on this. I quote myself here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's definitely a western-bias to the reporting on SIGINT-related things, but that's one of those things I suppose I just take for granted and expect.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So it's not like I'm completely oblivious to the fact that I realize there's bias when it comes to intelligence-related content, but lumping all of the stations that make up "NPR" into a monolithic, MSM generalization seems a bit unfair.

       Absolutely, there are also "clips" on WYPR where Johns Hopkins talks about a new "cardiovascular medical treatment," which is really just advertising for JH.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in that clip, all I hear is an advertisement for Truvada, who's manufacturers probably approached WABE (NYC's NPR station, and NYC has a lot of gays which is Truvada's target market) for $ in exchange for a 2.25min segment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting that NPR's stations only broadcast pure, unfettered truth. They wouldn't be in business otherwise. But what I am trying to say is that they're not just puppets in a coordinated propaganda plan. Each station has to make money, who they get their contributions from is a direct consequent of their targeted demographic, and this case of WABE in nyc is a fine example.

       Yeah NPR asks no hard hitting questions. They tow the state department line on everything. They sell the official Boston/9/11/Sandy Hook stories all day long. Never heard a piece on Common Core. It's supposed to be "supported by listeners like you," when it is really just an ad platform that generally does propaganda. They're better than most, but I stopped listening/donating. They're tools.

       that's why i only
       <em>
        really

       listen to the words of people who have been killed after disclosing facts. not that I believe everything they said, but i'm sure that

       Bill Cooper and Phil Schneider are the only two that I know of that fit this profile. cooper described 9/11 on 6/28/01; that utterly convinced me he knew what he's was talking about;
