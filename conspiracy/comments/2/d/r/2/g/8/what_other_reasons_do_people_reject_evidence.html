       This subject greatly interests me and I've been thinking about it lately. After watching videos, reading and experiences, I've come to realize that most people are unwavering in their belief of government's theory. Why? Does emotion simply trump logic? I've seen people get pretty mad when someone simply brings up a point about 9/11 that contradicts what they know or their worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to hear peoples thoughts, thanks.

       9/11 wasn't just allowed to happen, it was planned. There's no other way to explain the squibs (30-40 stories below collapsing/exploding floors) and 3-month raging fires after that day. Especially the latter, jet fuel ain't gonna do that.

       The terrorists are those who planned the attack, I obviously have no idea who.

       What I do know is that 19 men armed with boxcutters did not cause the towers to explode and did not cause jet fuel to become 1000 times more powerful than it's supposed to be.

       Best answer.

      <p>
       I reject the 9/11 Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reject my American Governments White Wash of 9/11 in every respect of Science, Intelligence, and Empirical Evidence that speaks volumes against the shit they posit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Across a very brief time span and compact miles, this Republic was thrust into a shit storm that was foretold by Eisenhower and by Kennedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no problem calling out my Government as Traitors, Murderers, Terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor should you.

       In 5th grade a cop came to my school and told me that if I smoked weed my legs would fall off.  I smoked weed in high school and my legs are fine.  After this I started to question all the things authority had told me.

       If they lied about weed, why not about 9/11?

       The lack of a cohesive narrative. I'm well aware the official account is not complete and in many places a total fabrication, I understand that there are at least half a dozen points of note which torpedo the words of the establishment. What I don't have is any answer or any 'real' sense of an actual narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can cope with that being an unknown quantity, but for many that is an incredibly uncomfortable prospect; and the idea of having a certain premise not just invalidated, but obliterated with chaos in it's wake is hard to imagine - not a refinement but a revolution.
      </p>

       It's hard to deal for many - that is the impression I get.

       There is 0% chance that a person on a suicide mission boarding a domestic flight would bring their passport if the flight was not leaving the country(not international).

       There is 0% chance that the plane would ignite into a fireball furnace killing every human &amp; obliterating every object onboard, yet a paper passport still survived and flew out the window of a completely sealed airplane and remained practically unscathed. This passport coincidentally belonged to one of the hijackers which then "proved" he was onboard the aircraft.

         3-month raging underground fires after towers are destroyed. Jet fuel cannot be responsible for that.

         Squibs 30 stories below exploding floors. It's not air pressure.

       <li>

         Bone fragments on roofs of neighboring buildings. The bodies were blown up, by explosions, in the towers. That's why 1000 victims in the towers could not be identified even by DNA.

The real flight 93 landed in Cincinnati.

       this could have been theater for the witnessing people watching in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       either a cruise missile or whatever, or a big shaped charge or perpetrator in that 'generator' trailer outside where the contractors were doing work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheney became a theater or silent movie villain in the eyes of people, prancing about in a cape hiding his face.
      </p>
      <p>
       most 9/11 Pentagon people think a cruise missile of some sorts hit the Pentagon, now these things are big and expensive and only available to a select few. ie the USAF, NASA, the CIA, the British warship off the coast.
      </p>
      <p>
       the simplest way is simulation of a plane or missile strike, no dangerous missile that could fail on a day when failure meant treason trials and life imprisonment, a big bomb (shaped charge or rocket) outside in a trailer is the simplest method. the aerial photos of the Pentagon from just after the strike seem to show small barrels or drums on the roof all nicely lined up and spaced out, exactly what you would expect to see if doing some type of Hollywood flash-pot explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shanksville was faked, the two planes at the WTC were CGI fakes, so why wouldn't the Pentagon plane/missile be fake also.
      </p>
      <p>
       fakery is push button control, pretend and props,  and total MSM control of coverage and witnesses, nothing is left to go wrong.

       Mineta: "During the time that the airplane was coming into the Pentagon, there was a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President...the plane is 50 miles out...the plane is 30 miles out....and when it got down to the plane is 10 miles out, the young man also said to the vice president "do the orders still stand?" And the Vice President turned and whipped his neck around and said "Of course the orders still stand, have you heard anything to the contrary!??"

       But when you have been researching for a while you recognize the patterns. Part of the detection is the golden question of cui bono.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually, bad things make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the narrative is overly dramatic, like too good to be true for the purpose of itself, then the fraud becomes apparent.

       For example--Jeff Bauman. How many of the stub-legged Bauman's are there--about ten of them???

       I have been researching government corruption for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another interesting tidbit to notice. So in the morning when the police first got there, they chased a few guys across from the gymnasium up onto the hillside. You can see the shed with the door hanging open. But this was first thing!
      </p>
      <p>
       We are shown a video of the cops busting open that shed and entering it--that was filmed the day before!
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sandy Hook staged event was filmed over a couple of days.

       Look at Carlee Soto:

       Even the parents weren't allowed to see the bodies, that's pretty strange if you ask me. And there were the parents who weren't-so despondant. I'm not convinced that Sandy Hook was a false flag, I'm not convinced by the official story either.

       also Rex Features (UK company that did the organizing of victim photographs for the Sandy Hoax, the logistics of victims), and the potential involvement of América TeVé (Florida) which presumably handled the US side of the hoax. and a lot of the crisis actors came from Florida, as did some of the supporting cast.
      </p>
      <p>
       trouble is Rex Features screwed up, they used a stolen picture of the 2009 UK child Lily Gaubert as one of the dead Sandy Hoax kids, took the MSM three weeks for them to change the picture to another.

       you would think the US parents of a child would use a real picture of their own child, not a picture stolen from a UK website.

      <p>
       the answer is Rex Features which used the French site SIPA to host the Sandy Hoax photos in June 2012 for distribution on 12/14/12.

      <p>
       Rex Features along with América TeVé bought into SIPA, theres a clear money connection.

       Connecticut Governor, Daniel P. Malloy said something very curious in his press briefing. He said that they were "spoken to" and told to be ready for something like this in their state.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said the following...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Lt. Governor and I have been... spoken to, in an attempt that we might be prepared for something like this playing itself out in our state."
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that makes his statement even more curious is the fact that he chose his words very carefully. He pauses to seemingly get his words straight, then delivers the big quote, that he had been forewarned to be prepared.
The biggest question is, who spoke to him and warned him to be ready?
      </p>
      <p>
       Eric Holder!

        Connecticut Governor, Daniel P. Malloy said something very curious in his press briefing. He said that they were "spoken to" and told to be ready for something like this in their state.
He said the following...
"Lt. Governor and I have been... spoken to, in an attempt that we might be prepared for something like this playing itself out in our state."
The thing that makes his statement even more curious is the fact that he chose his words very carefully. He pauses to seemingly get his words straight, then delivers the big quote, that he had been forewarned to be prepared. The biggest question is, who spoke to him and warned him to be ready?
Eric Holder!

Eric Holder met with Gov. Malloy two weeks before Sandy Hoax:

       That doesn't prove anything in the slightest. A Governor meeting with a Federal official is certainly common, and politicians - at least smart ones -
       <em>
        always

       try to choose their words carefully.

       There is a media selection bias with false flags. Meaning, shit happens yes... But the media goes extra nuts on the stories which support the ongoing matrix-esque narrative tptb weave of our reality. Ie false flag events.

       As someone who doesn't think 911 was a false flag, or done by our government, I'll throw in my two cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've looked at both sides, and just find the "official narrative" far more plausible and likely than any of the conspiracy theories I've seen out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the documentaries I've watched are less full of facts and more full of leading questions, and cherry picked "anomalies".  They are presented in such a way as to be very convincing at first look. Upon further reflection though I realized that it wasn't actually saying anything of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       That of course doesn't mean the government isn't capable of lying or anything like that. I'm just not convinced that they are in this case.

        Explains the fact that the connection of 911 and the Anthrax Attack proves that 911 was an Inside Job. The Anthrax Attack was already known to be an Inside Job because the FBI said it was an Inside Job. 911 has various specific things that connect it to the Anthrax Attack making it clear that they were carried out by the same people. Therefore it was an Inside Job too.

       no, the hijackers were named very early, 100% conclusive by the US govt, it just turned out several IDs had either been borrowed or stolen.

       One of the original "Truth Movement" movies (Loose Change) was made by a group of teenagers who admittedly set out to make a work of fiction, but once the movie took off they doubled down and stood behind it and subsequent movies as being factual.

       People have been indoctrinated by the owners of the media into believing tv is incapable of lying.  Many (most?) people have come to view their television as their "provider of truth", their every-day god, and they will believe what tv tells them to believe. To them, the word of god-box trumps logic, as well as their personal visual perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       The twin towers didn't explode, they collapsed into dust.  How do we know?  Because the tv said so.  Who cares about WTC7?  WTC7 is not important, because if it were, Bill O and Wolf would be doing their required "high priest" duties and informing us about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that's the crux: Some people can't imagine their tv will lie to them.  It's too much of a shock for them to come to that understanding all at once.

       People have a need to conform to the world around them as to fit in, some people are so afraid to rock the boat that they will believe whatever's needed of them to fit in. I bet more people don't believe the official story than talk openly about  it. We are not so unique as to be alone in our beliefs. We all have the same Internet, we can all find the same information.

       'Ambiguity tolerance' seems to be a relevant construct in this context: "Ambiguity Tolerance-Intolerance is a psychological construct which describes the relationship that individuals have with ambiguous stimuli or events. Individuals view these stimuli in a neutral and open way or as a threat." -

       Because most of the "undeniable evidence" presented by the conspiracy crowd is anything but undeniable.  Those that accept it at face value because someone points at it and says it is "proof" are often ill equipped to judge the merits of the evidence because they do not possess the background knowledge required to form an informed opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eyewitness testimony from panicked people is not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Questionable interpretations of grainy amateur video is not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The opinions of people, even smart people, who's expertise lies outside of the evidence in question is not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come up with good evidence such as:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Documents or electronic records pointing to either a controlled demolition or remote controlled aircraft/missles.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Data from scientific instrumentation in place on 9/11 that indicate demolitions bringing down any of the collapsed buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) A living perpetrator, a pilot, weapons technician, an explosives expert, or anyone who placed explosives in the buildings at any time prior to 9/11.  Or bonus anyone working in the buildings before 9/11 who witness such activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the buildings were brought down by bombs all of this exists but none has ever come to light.  Show me real evidence and I'll believe you.  In the meantime critically examine your own evidence and find out what experts outside of the echo chamber of the "truth" movement think about it.

       Just out of curiosity, have you seen the documentary "The New Pearl Harbor" on YouTube? It's pretty good, and it brings up a lot of valid points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to be rude or condescending, but some aspects of the 9/11 narrative are simply impossible to believe:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         3-month raging underground fires. There's no way some jet fuel (most of which was consumed by the massive fireballs after the plane impacts) could accomplish this.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Steel beams completely bent with no cracks. Again, some jet fuel could not have done this.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Molten steel running "like lava" according to firefighters. Again, extremely high temperatures with no apparent explanation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bone fragments on the roof of a neighboring building. If the floors from the towers simply collapsed onto each other, it wouldn't have pulverized the bodies in this manner.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Over 1,000 victims in the towers never identified even by DNA. It means their bodies were blown up, completely, and not squished between collapsing floors. 1,000 is a lot of people to be vaporized without a trace. Otherwise they would have found pieces of them to identify.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You can see explosive ejections way below the "collapsing" floors. It's pulzerized debris/building materials, and it cannot possibly be "air pressure." Otherwise we wouldn't see it on camera.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       This is evidence, because a simple gravitational collapse can't account for thee phenomena.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, you can disagree with me or anything like that, I wouldn't mind. I just don't understand how anyone can believe that a gravitational collapse could fuel fires for 3 months even with all the water being poured on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Much of the eyewitness testimony (hundreds) was from firefighters, there's a good chance if they described explosions, there were explosions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the lobby of one of the towers was partially destroyed when the plane hit, there's no way the plane could have caused that.

       A) I don't care what parts of the narrative you don't believe.  Don't tell me what happened was impossible, show me what actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Shiny patches in blurry photos do not evidence make.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) You're a firefighter, shits on fire, and bodies are literally raining from the sky.  Now you are going to run up 80 flights of stairs to help panicked civilians out of a building that you KNOW is going to collapse.  This is the most stressful moment you will ever experience, yeah you memory and subsequent eye-witness testimony is pretty much useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You can't explain that" is not valid justification for weaving a giant conspiracy-web story.

       They're not blurry photos, they're YouTube videos, that's why I even included the URL and time stamp in those screenshots, so anyone can see for themselves. There are many other videos too, I just didn't bother to include them.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You can't explain it" is a valid justification, because the official story has never been explained with evidence. NIST's investigation obviously makes no sense and they didn't bother to explain why the towers collapsed (only "collapse initiation", which was also bogus).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof is on those who support the official story, not those who don't believe it. This is because there is no evidence to support a gravitational collapse of the towers. So the real question is, where is your evidence that the phenomena I mentioned are perfectly normal?
      </p>
      <p>
       To use your own words, since there is no evidence to support the official narrative regarding the destruction of the towers, "show me what actually happened" in order to prove the official story.

       It really isn't.  There are a couple of areas they cover in that video that I actually do have real expertise in.  I can say categorically that their assertions in several places are 100% wrong.  If you are going to give me information that I know is wrong about the things I do know about, I am going to ignore your "facts" about the rest as well.

       Take any argument from that video, any 5 minute clip and bring it to an expert in the field they are covering that is not involved in the "truth" movement.  They will point out all of the flaws for you, and will be happy to do it.

       Yeah, see they have. That is why there are thousands of scientists, engineers, demolition experts that are used and quoted across the truth movement and none of them had anything to do with the movement in the early years. They looked at the available evidence, tested it against their REAL expertise, and found it to be bullshit. This video debunks every debunker out there(Popular mechanics) and it does it thoroughly, systematically, and academically. They provide proof and researchable science with citations. You did not watch this video and I am done with you. you demand evidence. I provide you with five hours of well researched argument and evidence and you throw it away, trying to convince me that you watched it. I am done with liars. All you did was say you were an "Expert" in some areas and then call it bullshit. Where is your citations and research? Where is your proof of expertise?
