<p>Today on Facebook someone said that the cure for cancer has been found and has been known about since 1979 but has been oppressed by the US government because they know billions could be made in the medical market. This is when the &#39;war on drugs&#39; was create to make people think drugs are bad so people don&#39;t find the cure to illnesses that need long time care such as cancer. What is this cure? Cannabis Oil, not cannabis smoking but oil that comes from the plant. Many people have taken cannabis oil and have had successful results even in stage 4 cancer which is hard to recover from with some doctors giving up hope for these cancer patiences.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and if anyone has any thing to say on the matter I&#39;d love to hear what you have to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of important things to keep in mind on this topic:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cancer is not 1 disease, it&#39;s 100&#39;s and 1000&#39;s of different types all lumped under the very general category of &quot;Cancer.&quot; So every headline that reads &quot;Cure for Cancer&quot; is misleading and incorrect, right off the bat.</li>
<li>Cancer is our own cells malfunctioning, so it is <em>exceedingly</em> difficult to find something to kill these cells without causing too much damage to the rest of the body.</li>
<li>Research on different cures for different cancers occurs in every major academic medical system in the world, so there would have to be an <em>immense</em> effort to keep all mentions of intellectual property under wraps, seeing as for every &quot;partial cure&quot; there several independent research groups that are competing against each other to get the product to market.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s called they made Marijuana illegal, and both CBD AND THC have been medically proven to cure myriads of cancers.</p>

<p>THIS is the cancer conspiracy, they have made Marijuana illegal because daily SMOKING ( yes that&#39;s right folks, straight up smoking weed through a water filtered bong ) over a 15 year period provably REDUCES your chances of getting cancer below that of which they were BEFORE you started smoking.</p>

<p>So yeah, the conspiracy is that they damn well know that Marijuana is the key to curing most all cancers, so they make it illegal because pharmaceutical companies can&#39;t hold a monopoly on a plant that people can grow in their own home.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really that cut and dry simple.</p>

<p>There are many more reasons as to why Marijuana is illegal (private prison industry, padding local police department budgets), but that&#39;s off topic here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://paulingblog.wordpress.com/2008/10/28/clarifying-three-widespread-quotes/">Here</a> is a blog that is run by <a href="http://paulingblog.wordpress.com/about/">Oregon State University Libraries</a> that appear to e <em>obssessed</em> with Linus Pauling and disagree on both it&#39;s validity and his true opinion of the matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Google has indexed 547 static webpages that include some version of this quote, attributed to Linus Pauling.  Only one of these 547 pages includes a citation: Outrage! For Those Opposed to Animal Abuse. (Tonbridge, Kent England) 47, October/November 1986.  The staff at Animal Aid, which published this issue of Outrage!, kindly provided us with a scan of the page on which this quote appears — see the lower left-hand side:</p>

<p>The first detail that pops out to us is that there is no citation provided for the quote.  It’s pretty clear too, that the quote was not given by Pauling as an exclusive to Outrage! Moreover — and most importantly — it seems unlikely to us that Pauling would paint with such a clumsy brush in recounting his feelings about cancer research.</p>

<p>Clearly Pauling was deeply upset about the Mayo trials and their conclusions — his anger on this matter is well-documented in the Pauling archive — and he obviously wasn’t against describing the Mayo work as “fraudulent.”  However, his extending that description to “most cancer research” strikes us as being out of character.</p>

<p>Pauling was a very clear thinker and a careful writer, and it seems to us that his feelings about cancer research, circa 1986, are more likely summed up by these extracts from his book How to Live Longer and Feel Better:</p>

<p>Despite the great amount of money and effort expended in the study of cancer, progress during the last twenty-five years has been slow.  A significant increase in survival time after diagnosis was achieved about thirty years ago, largely through improvements in the techniques of surgery and anesthesia.  During the last twenty-five years some improvement in treatment of certain kinds of cancer has been achieved, mainly through the use of high-energy radiation and chemotherapy, but for most kinds of cancer there has been essentially no decrease in either incidence or length of time of survival after diagnosis, and it has become evident that some new ideas are needed, if greater control over this scourge is to be achieved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The govt isn&#39;t benefiting. ..private corporations do. Drug companies, hospitals, oncologists,  plastics industry, nurses. It can create an economic collapse if a &quot;cure&quot; existed. The focus is on long term treatment not a one easy treatment,  or not patentable.  Cancer is a serious business, but also complicated as fuck. In some individuals it can cure on its own. ..good immune system...in some cases...it won&#39;t...chemo, radio, stem cell, plants, meditation. ..all helps...no silver bullet.</p>

<p>But canabis oil and eating non processed foods (no chemicals and preservatives) can help diminish the rising cancer rates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to be that guy but the government is totally gaining from this, who do you think has them in their pockets? And for an economical colapse because we could actually help people, maybe that will tell what is actually wrong, that the government is willing to let its people die for money. So I say if its going to break, let it because we can start a new, its just too bad that most people are afraid of change probably because we know that it means that we will have to give up some of our luxuries so that the rest of the world can balace out. But thats my two cents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the government is in collusion with those individuals for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a symbiotic relationship, the government does, indeed, benefit. </p>

<p>I feel that where we diverge in thought is our concept or per eption of &quot;government.&quot; I view that term as those who rule. And when the CEO&#39;s of mega corporations work in tandem with top government officials, from drafting legislation to the selective enforcement of regulations, I view the two entities as one and the same. Hence why I consider our current system of governance to be of a plutocratic nature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you are getting at. And again, I want to indicate our divergence of perception. I feel you see the government as an entity of the people, while I see it as a group of people who govern. </p>

<p>The president, the fbi, nsa, cia, big pharma, they are all parts of a whole. And, as you suggested, the government&#39;s purpose is to <em>serve</em> the people. However, in reality, this is not the case. The government as a whole serve only the interests of the individuals that make up this government. They care only for themselves and their own preservation. </p>

<p>And again, their collusion with top CEOs establishes a symbiotic relationship, and by definition, this allows them to benefit from such an establishment. </p>

<p>Those things you listed, free healthcare, better infrastructure, etc., are only things that would be indicative of benefits of the people. It is important to segregate the ideas that the government benefits and the people benefit. These two ideas are not mutually inclusive. That is, the government can certainly benefit without allowing the people to benefit in the same fashion. </p>

<p>And, as I see the government as the individuals who rule, through the symbiotic relationships with other entities, those individuals do indeed benefit. Thus, I stand firm on my argument that the government also benefits when the top officials and politicians and leaders benefit. </p>

<p>But I understand your position, wherein lies the idea that the government is for the people, and thus couldn&#39;t possibly benefit if the people do not also benefit. But, I do not label the government as a subsidiary entity of the people. At least, not in our current era.</p>

Good points though, and I understand cancer is different in each person, but I would assume they could possibly break it down per bloodline? I&#39;m not saying this with anything backing me up, just a thought.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for us Sub guys we actually get it a little better because the cooks have to make everything from scratch. But it&#39;s mostly the meat that&#39;s terrible for the most part everything they make is friend or oven baked, but it&#39;s just these big logs of meat, lol. It&#39;s that, we have UHT, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s good or bad for ya, I&#39;ve seen articles on both sides. The eggs we eat are up to 2 months old, and sitting in a bilge (basically a sub&#39;s basement I guess is the best way to put it). All of the canned items and condiments have been expired 4-5 times but the shelf life just gets a line through it and said it&#39;s &quot;still good&quot;. Main reason I would always bring my own hot sauce and just use that for almost everything. When we would on-load food a few years ago, it was always hand over hand to get everything down, so you got to see everything. Some of the meat had been packaged 10-12 years ago, but was still good I guess because it was frozen most of the time? I was on my boat for seven years, after like the 3rd year is when I started bringing my own food because I couldn&#39;t stand eating that shit anymore. Between the food and the chemicals used to clean the air I&#39;ll be dead in no time, lol.</p>

<p>Ground meat (beef, lamb, pork) keeps for two or three months; roasts, steaks, and chops can be kept frozen for at least half a year. Leftovers: two to three months. Fruits and vegetables can be frozen eight months to a year and still taste fine.</p>
