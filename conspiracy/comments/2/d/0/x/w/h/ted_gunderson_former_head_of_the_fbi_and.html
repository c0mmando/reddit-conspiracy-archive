    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s something I&#39;ve never been able to get straight about Chemtrails, 2 things actually. I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll enlighten me.</p>

<p>First is, all the evidence I&#39;ve seen that people use to point to their existence can be explained with an understanding of how combustion of jetfuel at high altitude causes the resulting water, given off as a by product, to condense into contrails. The same effect you get from an exhaust on a truck when you start it on a cold day.</p>

<p>Second is, if there is a secret fleet of tankers spraying the skies with mind suppressing substances, where are all these unmarked planes being stored, and why hasn&#39;t anyone with a telephoto lens been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they exist?</p>

<p>I expect down votes here, but I&#39;m being genuine. I have an interest in the truth and this is one thing that comes up again and again that I just can&#39;t see the evidence for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can make clouds, you can change the weather. Maybe everyone talking about mind control chemtrails are missing what&#39;s really going on: the weather&#39;s getting messed up, intentionally or unintentionally, by the clouds airplanes are making.  </p>

<p>I came to this conclusion after living near and airport and spending a few days sitting and watching the trails spread out into clouds, slowly mixing together to make very unnatural looking clouds, but clouds nonetheless. Every single day I saw that happen it drizzled or rained that night. I was a pretty avid sky watcher for a while, another thing I noticed was that some days the air traffic was much heavier than others, these were the days the clouds formed.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t really be all that surprised if there was some room in the shadow budget to hire some pilots to fly around, ignorantly making clouds with their exhaust, maybe on the pretense of taking aerial photography (maybe for the secondary purpose of aerial surveillance).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are 100% correct that airplanes now make clouds, and I don&#39;t remember seeing this phenomenon happening a single time more than about 7 or so years ago. The extent to which airplane exhaust will make clouds can be changed by adding sulfur:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An article about NASA <em>discussing a potential geoengineering technique</em> is in no way evidence that the contrails you&#39;re seeing are <em>actually geoengineering.</em> Do you see the problem here?</p>

<p>When chemtrail theories started hitting the internet in the 90s the rationale was completely different and people attributed it to some sort of wide-scale drugging of the population.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would pilots admit to that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe because they went to school for years to become a commercial pilot, and presumably only later were forced into complicity in some mass, sinister chemical spraying conspiracy? </p>

<p>Do you honestly think that when they&#39;re being instructed on the operation of their 747 or whatever, a shadowy government / NASA agent approaches them and says &quot;oh yeah and when you reach cruising altitude switch on the chemtrails. Please don&#39;t say anything about this publicly, thanks&quot; ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let&#39;s pretend we are chemtrail pilots and our job is to give New York City a dose of sleepy time.  How high up do you have to spray to be effective?  10,000 feet?  5,000 feet?  The airspace around New York is restricted so you couldn&#39;t just make a nice blanket of chemical over the area.  You&#39;d need to drop the chemicals ahead of the city and let the wind blow it in.  You would need to do this while operating around restricted airspace at the correct altitude for effective dosing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of a persistent trail defies the laws of humidity.  When you exhale in the winter the crystals don&#39;t last because the moisture in them is being disassembled and spread out to the dry air in effort to balance  the moisture evenly.  The force of nature will not compromise because of altitude, the vapor crystals from the planes will be disassembled and spread out also, that is why contrails don&#39;t last over a minute and that means persistent trails are not ice crystals.     </p>

<p>&quot;advocate geoengineering methods such as spraying millions of tonnes of reflective particles of sulphur dioxide 30 miles above earth&quot;</p>

<p>I dont know if its happening now, probably is, but no where the scale bill gates wants it.</p>

<p>sulfur dioxide is apparently literally deadly poison, harmful in short exposure of just hours or days. (source epa.gov)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it.  Why do you bring up &quot;mind suppressing substances&quot; when everyone here is claiming that &quot;chemtrails&quot; are a form of geoengineering?  The person you are responding to even said flat out &quot;its not about poisoning us.&quot;    </p>

<p>The only people I ever see bringing up the chemtrails=poison thing are people arguing against it, whereas people that believe in them are unanimous in thinking they are for geoengineering.  Its such a clear case of disinformation.  </p>

<p>What &quot;chemtrails&quot; are is sulphate aerosols (and perhaps reflective heavy metals such as aluminum oxide:</p>

<p>First is, all the evidence I&#39;ve seen that people use to point to their existence can be explained with an understanding of how combustion of jetfuel at high altitude causes the resulting water, given off as a by product, to condense into contrails. The same effect you get from an exhaust on a truck when you start it on a cold day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s all disinformation put out by the FAA, FEMA, DEA, NATO, USA. BATF, NAFTA, FBI, CIA. MI6, KGB, SS, NWO, MOSSAD, TERRORISTS, AND George W. Bush. They did a really good job of making all of the scientific data seem legitimately old and somehow they modified the papers to be in journals that came out decades ago. Somehow they got a hold of a ton of copies of journals and replaced them with their false data saying planes make trails of condensed water at high altitudes because they are very hot and the air around them is cold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second is, if there is a secret fleet of tankers spraying the skies with mind suppressing substances, where are all these unmarked planes being stored, and why hasn&#39;t anyone with a telephoto lens been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they exist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah man, you don&#39;t get it. Chem trails aren&#39;t coming from unmarked Illuminato jets, they come from EVERY jet. Boeing, Airbus, and Lockheed have all created their engines to create this extremely dangerous chemical that no one knows what it is and sprays it all over the sky. That illiminates the need for unmarked jest and the need to refill them all the time with this super secret biowarrior-chemical-bad-stuff-thing stuff.</p>

<p>The truth is, you will never know the truth. You aren&#39;t allowed because people make up crazy things like chemtrails. Things like this distract everyone from the clear and present problems that face us today and pose a serious threat to everyone on this planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Care to back up your &quot;some how&#39;s&quot; with hard facts? And let&#39;s not confuse Chemtrails with weather modification, these things are separate. The latter is reality, the former, well the jury is still out as far as I see.</p>

<p>Seems to be a lot of effort and co-ordination between a lot of very disparate organizations required in order to make this happen as you propose. Also, since have been well over 6000 Airbus A320s built, and that&#39;s just one model, you&#39;d think at least 1 airframe or maintenance engineer would have leaked the fact they found &quot;secret&quot; tanks to hold &quot;mystery&quot; chemicals. Or are all aerospace engineers illuminati and bound to secrecy?</p>

<p>Simply by applying some basic knowledge and logic the argument doesn&#39;t stand up. Even if you were to propose that these alleged secret chemicals are hidden in the fuel, surely someone would have tested and made available details of the fuel additives. Avgas and Jet-A are fairly easy to get a hold of at any small airport.</p>

<p>In my opinion, and this is an opinion here so take it or leave it, Chemtrails is actually a cleverly manufactured distraction that serves 2 purposes. The first is to distract truth seekers and divert their energy away from real conspiracies, like 911 for example. The second is to reinforce the idea that &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are tin hat whackos that believe in really strange things despite a complete lack of hard evidence.</p>

<p>Chemtrails should be put to rest as an unproven, far fetched fantasy so that we can all get on with uncovering the real hidden issues that are causing pain and destruction across the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a 1995 conference in Dallas, Gunderson warned about the proliferation of secret Satanic groups, and the danger posed by the New World Order, a shadow government that would be controlling the US government. He also claimed that a “slave auction” in which children were sold to men in turbans had been held in Las Vegas, that four thousand ritual human sacrifices are performed in New York City every year, and that the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was carried out by the US government. Gunderson believed that in the US there is a secret widespread network of groups who kidnap children and infants, and subject them to Satanic ritual abuse and subsequent human sacrifice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the end, Gunderson&#39;s farfetched tales probably helped the credibility of the U.S. government and the FBI, by undermining the more sober critics out there - critics, that is, who were not prone to claim that Satan and his minions are behind every conceivable, or possible, government misdeed. </p>

<p>Indeed, it would be easy to construct an entire conspiracy theory genre in which Ted Gunderson had actually never retired from the FBI but, rather, continued to draw U.S. government pay in his putative role as a spoiler who promoted poorly (or wholly) unsupported claims that, in turn, polluted credible research and journalism.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll probably never know the truth. And so it goes. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s a bit more likely that Gunderson died of cancer. If he was indeed poisoned, then his alleged killers were notably, even absurdly, incompetent. Ted Gunderson had been promoting his various anti-government theories for about three decades. </p>

<p>For example, Gunderson was one of the chief sources promoting the urban myth that the U.S. government had commissioned the construction of thousands of railroad boxcars fitted out with leg shackles and guillotines. </p>

<p>( <a href="http://www.thegovernmentrag.com/mullen_slicing_into_consciousness_guillotines.html#.U-XwlEikQy4">http://www.thegovernmentrag.com/mullen_slicing_into_consciousness_guillotines.html#.U-XwlEikQy4</a> )</p>

<p>Ted Gunderson was also member of the Constitution Party. The CR Party is closely tied to the Christian Reconstructionism movement, whose founders advocate the institution of pre-Talmudic biblical law, including &quot;biblical&quot; methods of capital punishment such as stoning and burning at the stake for various infractions including homosexuality, adultery, &quot;un-chastity&quot; (female sex before marriage), blasphemy, and witchcraft.</p>

<p>Gunderson was also a member of the &quot;Prophecy Club&quot; - whose 1990s talks would help fuel the rise of the anti-government evangelical militia movement which gave rise to the Oklahoma City bombing that Gunderson, notably, claimed was perpetrated by the U.S. government. Oklahoma City bomber Tim McVeigh grew up amidst the white supremacist wing of the militia movement that Gunderson&#39;s narratives helped provoke. (see: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/04/AR2005060400147.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/04/AR2005060400147.html</a> )</p>

<p>One of the few remotely credible relevant news reports  -- on Gunderson&#39;s storied three-decade long post-FBI career promoting various narratives about vast shadowy evil satanic (inevitably satanic, sometimes gay as well) cabals he alleged were behind just about every celebrity death and news event of the day -- puts it this way:</p>

<p>&quot;...Admittedly, 30 years is long time to wait to have a man silenced. Long enough, in fact, that he should have been able to disclose everything proprietary in that time. ...83 is a bit of an old age to claim premature death, especially when the 83 year-old in question did in fact have cancer. But in order to understand the “suspicions” surrounding Gunderson’s death, it is important to understand the whole of the Ted Gunderson story, to appreciate the shadow of fear, the miasma of paranoid discontent that he so actively engendered throughout his life. In the world of Ted Gunderson, every seemingly arbitrary idiosyncrasy, every obscure sign constructed from the random held signification aimed inexorably toward one unifying narrative.</p>

<p>Indisputable though his credentials were, the believability of his accusations against the FBI were routinely diluted by the innumerable bombastic conspiracist claims he would make throughout the years.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re assuming it isn&#39;t already being run as a clandestine project. There are two types of secret projects, &quot;top secret&quot; which you have to have a need to know to get into, and &quot;clandestine&quot; which are denied throughout to people not in the know, no matter their position. Remember NSA? Its spying was denied, even to Congress, &quot;we&#39;re only collecting metadata&quot; meanwhile everything is being stored even now. It took a whistleblower to bring that into the public sphere.
The geoengineereing projects are something I believe have been going on for some time as a clandestine UN operation in Europe at least, don&#39;t know whos handling it in the west. We have clouds on clear skies, droughts followed by floods, we have warm winters and cool summers, agricultural produce is steadily going down, especially this year which is by far the worst, and Monsanto has developed and is selling aluminum resistant seeds.
Regarding to David Keith, I believe he knows its been going on for some time, and even Colbert confronted him on that on his show, when he said it was extremely unlikely its going on Colbert said; &quot;That the government is doing something and not telling us, I find that extremely likely&quot;. He also received millions from Bill Gates to promote the idea. Keith himself admits its not a new idea, that it was conceived somewhere in the 60&#39;s, but its very improbable they would push that out in any sort of public way, just like this mass surveillance. People wouldn&#39;t stand for it, they want to fuck up the weather to the point where this program will be pushed as a solution to the problem they created in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s very very different than passenger jets spraying chemicals out of their engines. I 100% support geoengineering and hope we can use our years of accumulated engineering and scientific skills to help stabilize the downfall of our climate. If we can get on top of it before it&#39;s &#39;too-too&#39; late we may just have a chance at keeping our glaciers from melting and sea levels from rising.</p>

<p>Despite all of that, no one is using passenger jets as some kind of delivery device for some unknown chemical that no one knows what it is or even knows what it does. Everything anyone &#39;knows&#39; is pure speculation and/or fabrication. </p>

<p>The whole idea is ridiculous and the NWO / Illuminati / israel has much better ways of distributing massive amounts of chemicals to everyone on the planet. Jet engines have been making trails in the sky since they have existed. People that believe in this are people that need to believe someone is out to get them (aka paranoid schizo).</p>

<p>I typed way more than I intended to because the whole idea of chemtrails drives me nuts and makes me feel bad that I am associated with people that believe this because I have an open mind about global conspiracies. Everyone always says &quot;Oh i bet you&#39;re one of those guys that thinks jets are spraying chemicals on us&quot; when I start discussing crazy conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>thank you good day</p>

<p>EDIT: I really hate Microsoft and closed source software in general, but I have come to notice that Bill Gates has only donated and supported actual worthy causes since his separation from the company. The B&amp;MG Foundation has done some pretty awesome stuff around the world and if they&#39;re supporting this then I suggest looking at it with an open mind.</p>

I noticed these new USPS vehicles, dodge caravans, replacing the old boxy vehicles in USA have cages separating the front from the back, just like in police cruisers - make shift detention transport vans? literally why else is that needed? </p>

<p>All I see around me is what my schooling has taught me about our planet&#39;s climate. Naturally occurring weather. Nothing out of the ordinary so far as I can see.</p>

<p>I need more than an un-sourced testimonial.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read multiple documents saying Geo-engineering is still just a proposal.</p>

Indeed the controversies surrounding new technologies have often led to a backlash against their development, as has been seen in the fields of genetically modified organisms and nuclear power.&quot;</p>
