Many of the nights, I can see 3-5 helicopters flying maneuvers far off in the distance past Seattle. I always assume they are coming from Lewis McCord!</p>

Even with the state of emergency due to the water ban that happend the police were absent from the area. I think it&#39;s different that the force has just disappeared in the last week. Anyone else from Toledo have any stories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a small town outside of Hartford CT and it may not be literal military but I have absolutely noticed an increase in militarized police presence. I&#39;ve personally witnessed increased police presence seemingly at every corner, vehicles that resemble tanks (I can&#39;t remember the name of the vehicle Atm but they&#39;re armored vehicles which seem a bit excessive for where I live), and recently I saw a huge trailer vehicle with the anagrams C.R.E.S.T. and when I looked it up I was very interested in why the fuck they would be controlling my frown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in the middle of a large triangle, with a major military base on each corner, not far from our nation&#39;s capitol. Usually, I see quite a bit of military presence. But not lately. </p>

<p>Convoys used to drive up and down the streets a couple times a year. But, I haven&#39;t seen any in the past two years or so. It&#39;s weird, but circumstantial at best, as I have no proof of anything, haven&#39;t seen anything, and it could just be I never was in the right place at the right time in the past two years to see the convoys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last saturday, we were driving to my sons soccer game. I live in Denton, TX. There are trains tracks almost the entire length of the road that his soccer fields are off of so there was a train chugging along the opposite way i was driving. About midway through this train were about 20 cars of armored vehicles. I wish i could have gotten a picture of it but i was so stunned to see so many that i couldn&#39;t really think of anything else except wtf. not sure where they were going or why but definitely not what i wanted to see at 8:30 in the morning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a Chinook a couple days ago. I live in CT and we see a lot of military helicopters because of the Sikorsky plants but Chinooks aren&#39;t made here so it&#39;s a rare sight. Last time I saw one was probable around a decade ago when they used one for fighting wild fires.</p>

<p>Aside from that, my town of less than 20k people just got a new MRAP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take it you are new to Columbus, let me educate you on the area. Rickenbacker has the <a href="http://www.121arw.ang.af.mil/">121st Air Reserve Wing</a> which recently <a href="http://www.121arw.ang.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123419274">participated in a large scale exercise</a>. Rickenbacker due to its large size is also a popular turn around spot for military aircraft on practice flights.<br/>
Columbus is also home to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Supply_Center,_Columbus">Defense Supply Center</a> which is a huge operation and has many military vehicles.<br/>
The <a href="http://www.oh.ang.af.mil/units/">Ohio National Guard</a> is based out the north side of The Ohio State University Airport (KOSU) at the Beightler Armory and they&#39;ll have Chinooks and the such fly in occasionally.<br/>
<a href="http://www.180fw.ang.af.mil/">Toledo</a> has the 180th Fighter Wing, which mainly has jets, but military aircraft (like your spotted Chinooks) all share bases when traveling cross country for practice or relocation, or whatever the reason may be. The reason you saw &quot;several&quot; Chinooks is because they rarely travel alone, groups are most common.<br/>
Also, in case you haven&#39;t had the pleasure to college level Psychology 1000 class yet, make sure you are aware of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect">Observer-expectancy effect</a> (or something close to it, idk, I slept through that class)</p>
