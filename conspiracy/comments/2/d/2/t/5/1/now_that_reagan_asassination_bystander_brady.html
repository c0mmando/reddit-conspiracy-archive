<p>The original prosecution was handed to a DC judge who nortoriously handled via agent cases . The judge lottery assignment system was circumvented to make Hinckley get that Judge.</p>

<p>A new trial might mean a REAL trial including evidence about the direct link between George H W Bush the vice president and his oil / CIA friend Hinckley who would have made him president if Reagan had died.</p>

<p>By the way Reagan was investigating Hinckleycs oil company Vanderbilt oil for overcharging the government as well.</p>

<p>All of this was suppressed during initial trial when internet didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Now these facts are known.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tomflocco.com/fs/HinckleyAndBush.htm">http://www.tomflocco.com/fs/HinckleyAndBush.htm</a></p>

<p>And see here for a fictionalized but accurate story about it (fictionalized to protect the author from lible and worse)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nathanielblumberg.com/bush.htm">http://www.nathanielblumberg.com/bush.htm</a>
For those of you who don&#39;t know.</p>

<p><strong>People remember to save any stories on this that comeup on major media websites because they will likely be pulled down very quickly.</strong></p>

<p>for example NBC news anchor John Chancellor&#39;s live on air comment that George Bush&#39;s son Neil Bush was to have dinner with John Hinckley&#39;s brother the day after the shooting (which he read live from the UP wire expressing utter disbeleif) appeared on youtube shortly after youtube was created but was quickly taken down and CANNOT NOW BE FOUND ANYWHERE. (no not the clip with him at the desk with the other reporter talking. he was alone and it was a previous broadcast)</p>

<p>We are talking about the attempted assassination of a president here and this stuff will get put up by accident and then the managers will pull it down so SAVE WHAT YOU SEE!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According a book Bush:Family of Secrets the bush clans involvement in USA political assassinations goes  from John Kennedy , to Robert Kennedy, to George Wallace, to Reagan  .  Its stunning if true.</p>

<p>Oswald worked for friend of bush. Sirhan Sirhan worked for friend of bush.
Nixon, bush , lbj were all in dallas when JFK killed. Ford was put on warren commission to cover it up (g h W bush basically admitted this in eulogy to Gerald ford at his funeral) e Howard hunt did the Watergate breakin which brought down Nixon putting ford into presidency as Ford&#39;s reward., e Howard hunt was CIA WHO had written bizarre diary found in apartment of George Wallace shooter. That diary became the basis for the movie Taxi Driver starring Jodie Foster. SUPPOSEDLY a letter was found from Reagan asassin Hinckley saying he was infatuated with Jodie Foster from that movie and that is why he wanted to kill Reagan. (yeah it really is that directly all linked to Bush)
The Hinckley letter was likely a forgery like the diary from Wallace shooter. E Howard hunt was a skilled spy novelist and the likely writer of both and he worked with bush in CIA since Bay Of Pigs which turned Kennedy against CIA and all involved.</p>

<p>It just goes on and on.</p>

<p>If even one tenth of what is claimed is true then Bush CIA crowd has been running USA  government since  Eisenhower at least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He just died several days ago and they are saying it was a result of his injuries from the shooting therefore a homocide.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a really big development and has huge remafications unless it gets covered up like the original whole thing was.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know if the CIA insiders still have the same level of control over the Judges in DC and the process like they did when George H W Bush was in office and had just come off DCI (Director of Central Intelligence). A lot of his old cronies are presumably retired and out of power and the whole CIA has been reshaped since. They just may not be able to bottle things up like the did then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This story is getting some mainstream media coverage and needs to have people post info on the comments sections of the mains tream media stories so it doesn&#39;t get whitewashed again.</p>

<p>If a lot of people did this on their favorite news sites over the next few days the story might get more traction.</p>

<p>this really has the potential to open up a HUGE investigation into the Bush stuff that has been overlooked for decades.</p>

<p>and it really is HUGE stuff based on the link  anononaut posted earlier</p>

<p><a href="http://halbower.blogspot.com/2009_02_01_archive.html">http://halbower.blogspot.com/2009_02_01_archive.html</a></p>

<p>for example you could post:</p>

<p>&quot;</p>

<p>Since the time of the original shooting we now know the whole Jodie Foster thing was nonsense and we know Hinckley was the son of Vanderbilt Energy Owner John Hinckley Sr who helped George Bush many times prior in trying to gainthe Presidency AGAINST REAGAN.</p>

<p>and John hinckley&#39;s brother was to have lunch with The Vice President&#39;s son, Neil bush,  the day after the assassination!</p>

<p><a href="http://nstarzone.com/HINCKLEY.html">http://nstarzone.com/HINCKLEY.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;Although John Hinckley Sr. was characterized repeatedly by the national news media as &quot;a strong supporter of President Reagan,&quot; no record has been found of contributions to Reagan. To the contrary, in addition to money given to Bush, a fellow Texas oilman, as far back as 1970, the senior Hinckley raised funds for Bush&#39;s unsuccessful campaign to wrest the nomination from Reagan. Furthermore, he and Scott Hinckley separately contributed to John Connally in late 1979 when Connally was leading the campaign to stop Reagan from gaining the 1980 presidential nomination. The Bush and Hinckley families, of course, would do better under a Bush presidency than it would under President Reagan. Available evidence at the time made clear many other connections between the Bush and Hinckley families. Reported &quot;coincidences&quot; involving the Hinckleys and the family of H.L. Hunt also remained unexplored. Even the official government line admitted that the Bush and Hinckley families &quot;maintained social ties.&quot; The deeply troubled Hinckley oil company obviously would fare better under a president Bush.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For example: Neil Bush, a landman for Amoco Oil, told Denver reporters he had met Scott Hinckley at a surprise party at the Bush home January 23, 1981, which was approximately three weeks after the U.S. Department of Energy had begun what was termed a &quot;routine audit&quot; of the books of the Vanderbilt Energy Corporation, the Hinckley oil company. In an incredible coincidence, on the morning of March 30, three representatives of the U.S. Department of Energy told Scott Hinckley, Vanderbilt&#39;s vice president of operations, that auditors had uncovered evidence of pricing violations on crude oil sold by the company from 1977 through 1980. The auditors announced that the federal government was considering a penalty of two million dollars. Scott Hinckley reportedly requested &quot;several hours to come up with an explanation&quot; of the serious overcharges. The meeting ended a little more than an hour before John Hinckley Jr. shot President Reagan.&quot;</p>
