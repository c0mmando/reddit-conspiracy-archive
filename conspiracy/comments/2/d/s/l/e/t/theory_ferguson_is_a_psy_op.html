<p>First off, notice the red cup?  Well, that would imply there&#39;s a party, but there&#39;s only one cup and no one else is drinking.  The person holding the camera is eating fried chicken, but no one else is eating.  ou Also, the person holding the camera asks the person giving the monolouge about what he saw several questions, if you listen closely, you can hear the cameraman&#39;s urban accent break several times.  Notice the container of juice just sitting there with the label perfectly facing the camera?  How about the bottle of medicated formula also within perfect sight.</p>

<p>I suspect these guys are NARCs; undercover cops trained to appear as urban citizens.</p>

<p>I believe the murder happened, and I believe there is a very real protest, but the looters are a plant.  I suspect they used an undercover agent in a neighboring area to inspire a large group to go loot, in order to give the police the excuse to stop the protest.</p>

<p>Well the mindset of the ruler is similar regardless of the country he rules. Once the checks and balances of the US constitutional system were undermined and destroyed the only result could be tyranny. Unrestrained tyranny until the inevitable revolt or destruction that must come to end the tyranny.</p>

<p>I doubt it. We have the largest economy in the world, a military that (in my opinion -- I may be biased because I&#39;m a veteran) would protect its citizens, and a very large amount of gun owners live here.</p>

<p>There are a LOT of bad things that have been going on, but when hasn&#39;t that been the case in history? It&#39;s only more visible now. These problems have persisted within humanity since the dawn of time. We are going to continue going through growing pains until we transcend into an enlightened species.</p>

<p>It should have been the other way. Mexico is also one of the largest economies in the world (#14, I believe) and it should have moved forward along your country. Instead, both countries are wasting their potential with these policies. </p>

<p>That is not Mexico, that is GLOBALISTS. They do everything in Mexico first to see if they&#39;ll be able to get away with it in the US. Canada and Mexico are America Jr. when it comes to testing political policy.</p>

<p>This is the work of TPTB that wish to see people continue to be their wage slaves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been this way for quite some time, if they really want to kill a person, they&#39;ll do it, just look at Fred P Hampton, who they clearly murdered by firing over 78 rounds into his room.</p>

<p>Oh boy, sound like being hired to a company in the US through a &quot;temp&quot; agency, where you&#39;re hired on a <em>contract</em> for 6 months, and if they <em>want</em> to &quot;keep you&quot; after that probation period is up, they &quot;will&quot;. You can also be fired for arbitrary reasons that they bury in your giant union contract, such as &quot;sitting in a sleep like position&quot; regardless of being on break or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then, Mexican workers seek to leave the country, and they go... well, elsewhere. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow, sounds kind of like what happens up here, except for it&#39;s corporations and their productions and headquarters moving states in favor of lower tax rates which in turn decimates their previous locations economy back into nothingness.</p>

<p>This is why cities are STUPID AS HELL, just look at Detroit. The only real industry sustaining it was that one thing, automotive manufacturing.</p>

<p>Your communities need to be much more sustainable than that, and just maybe a stupid ancient city like Chicago might be able to adapt due to our advances in self sustainability technology like vertical farming, synthetic meat, etc.</p>

<p>The fuck does that even mean? It won&#39;t be a literal transcendence into the sky or anything, so it must be metaphorical.</p>

<p>How is humanity going to reach a point where every single member of the species is &quot;evolved&quot; into this &quot;enlightened&quot; stage?</p>

<p>Will we have different DNA?</p>

<p>Sorry, I just think this whole trans-humanism new age garbage is just that, a load of feel good bullshit to deceive people into thinking that humanity is capable of not being comprised of murdering, lying, stealing pieces of shit.</p>

<p>The law of entropy states that this Universe is going to end regardless of anything humans do, even if you become so &quot;enlightened&quot; that you figure out a way to continue your existence in a computer world, it will still end one day when the rest of the universe ends.</p>

<p>You are going to die, humanity is not going to &quot;transcend into an enlightened species&quot;. We&#39;re already making printable hearts, yet the whole of humanity is still slitting each others throat for a 10 dollar an hour promotion over the other guy, doesn&#39;t sound too enlightened to me.</p>

<p>The whole world is still hostile against socialism and communism saying &quot;it will never work&quot; because it&#39;s true, there are assholes who will ruin it for everybody else, just like capitalism that at least gives people opportunity to choose for themselves what they wish to consume and where they wish to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion... this video looks more like the dude showed up at his buddy&#39;s place and started going off about what happened in the middle of whatever his friend was doing. Red solo cups aren&#39;t just for parties and we don&#39;t hear noise or conversation in the background indicating his friend was probably just enjoying some chicken on a cheap paper plate drinking out of a cheap cup watching TV when he arrived. Also... the bottle next to the minute maid looks like peroxide or something.</p>

<p>I agree with you on the looting. I believe provacateurs are being used and the killing itself was a purposeful provocation... and that perhaps even the officer blamed is just a volunteer scapegoat for the incident.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also noticed many of the police shootings are occuring in areas where tensions are high, be it whatever. Ferguson, Boston, New Orleans, St. Louis, Chicago, New York, Miami, Los Angeles... These are perfect places to incite all kinds of uproar to exploit since the people living there are already on edge in the first place. They&#39;re already pissed off and the government knows it even without their espionage, especially if it&#39;s a white cop being protected from a black community that isn&#39;t being prosecuted.</p>

<p>Imagine a white cop in New Orleans shoots an unarmed black teenage female at night ten times with no report, no witnesses, no calling for backup, and obviously no need to defend himself... Better yet, she is found to be a rape victim as well as having signs of battery. Then a week later his name is just now being released and no charges are being considered, all the while the police are surrounding the city with military grade weaponry. It&#39;s going to go down a whole lot crazier than Ferguson... So maybe they just needed to try a smaller area first as a tester before they really incite some hysteria.</p>

<p>It seems perhaps they&#39;re slowly desensitizing us to martial law as a reality. The more we see it... well, the more we&#39;ll get used to it, right?</p>

<p>EDIT: On second thought... who&#39;s to say the life of the officer and his family wasn&#39;t threatened if he didn&#39;t commit the act. Perhaps he was extorted by a higher authority and he&#39;s actually a great cop. It would make sense why they would act so vigorously to defend him if this were the situation... and they could never tell anyone. It makes everyone look bad, just as intended. Pure speculation.</p>

<p>If he had actually just saw that he would be way more emotional/angry.</p>

<p>Not saying this is the CIA planting videos because I think thats dumb, but the likelyhood that this dude is really a &quot;witness&quot; and what he said happened actually did, as he said it, is very, very low.</p>

<p>Thats what you need to figure out. I&#39;m still pondering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Ukraine is the beginning of WW3, but I&#39;ve had fears of Ebola since like forever and it&#39;s going parabolic and the people who know are saying all sorts of bad bad things. Gaza&#39;s fucked but the middle east will end up in a heap during WW3 I reckon. </p>

<p>But totally agree when they distract you from one thing to see what else they are trying to hide in the other hand :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psyops are all over the place everyday in many articles from so called <strong>press</strong> that is most often <strong>pulled</strong> on a leash.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>IMO calling a molotov cocktail a bottle rocket is a psyop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22Protesters+tossed+at+least+one+bottle+rocket%2C+the+police+said%22"><strong>&quot;Protesters tossed at least one bottle rocket, the police said&quot;</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Click the NYT story to see how they removed that ill <em>psyop play down reduction</em> &amp; rewrote the story.</p>

<p>NYT even changed the title from &quot;Police in Ferguson Arrest Protesters Who Defied Curfew&quot; to &quot;Justice Dept. to Conduct 2nd Autopsy in Ferguson Case&quot;.</p>

<p>Notice how the first hit of the imgtfy results should still be the New York Times &amp; that the time currently states the story as of when I just took <a href="http://i.imgur.com/mCfySwN.png">this snapshot of the lmgtfy search results</a> is only three hours old, but others that used it seem older. This is a BS edit time manipulation  error google diplays as the NYT removed the original article &amp; dramatically rewrote the whole story likely due to complaints. [real press documents edits, uses new web addresses for new stories &amp; BSers do not.]</p>

<p>Coincidence ? Another coincidence might be Snowden, a major (and whose death is turning point) character in the 1953 novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22">Catch-22</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yossarian is a 28-year-old captain of a B-25 bombardier during World War II... It focuses on their attempts to keep their sanity in order to fulfill their service requirements so that they may return home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ferguson is still far from the &quot;race-war&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots">1992 L.A. riots</a> or anti-globalization <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests">1999 Battle of Seattle</a>.</p>

<p>What I see is the reflection of an overly-military local police force, racial tensions, economic instability, and (willingly?) haphazardous foreign policies.</p>
