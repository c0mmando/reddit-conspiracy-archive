<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Brown is not. It&#39;s the concept of racism, divide and conquer, and predictive programming. Next time we see police show up in MRAPs with assault and sniper rifles, the average person will think, &quot;oh the cops are here.&quot;</p>

<p>I was happy to hear some people at the protest saying this is not a white/black issue. It&#39;s an American issue. To that I say, here here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. If the kid would have killed the cop, it would be reversed. What I wanna know is how is it character assassination by showing the surveillance store camera of the shoplifting? What I think happened is is that he thought the cop knew and tried to attack him and take his gun. The cop went over board in shooting him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the left calls facts &quot;character assassination.&quot; Just like with Trayvon buying the skittles and fruit drink for the cough syrup stuff he had been using. As soon as a black kid is killed, any previous indiscretions are wiped from the record I guess.</p>

<p>And yeah, they make tasers and mace for a reason. Particularly, to not kill teenagers/dogs/autistic kids, etc. Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a cop though. You can kill anyone, get a vacation, and be found innocent. Murder by cop is incentivized by the system.</p>

<p>+1.  I completely agree.  By refusing to fall into the Obama/Holder race baiting, we beat them at their own game.  It isn&#39;t a race issue, it&#39;s an over-reaching, wannabe-police-state government issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You couldn&#39;t be more right, at least as far as my friend Tony is concerned.  Seems like every time I see him he&#39;s complaining about someone being out to get him because he&#39;s black, or because they&#39;re just racist, or KKK, or whatever.  When I try to explain to him that there are more reasons someone might dislike him other than his color, he refuses to hear it and gets annoyed that I mentioned it.</p>

<p>But the truth is, his life is in shambles, he&#39;s habitually skipping out on work, or calling in sick (but not because he&#39;s sick), he has money issues and health issues and wears a defibrulator on his hip because his heart is near failure because he&#39;s 350+ lbs since he only eats fast food.  So really all he has is his victim card.  It&#39;s not my fault I&#39;m not at work, they&#39;re racist.  It&#39;s not my fault I don&#39;t have money, if they weren&#39;t all KKK members I&#39;d be happily employed.  It&#39;s not my fault I have health issues, it&#39;s McDonald&#39;s fault.  He&#39;s sued the school district twice, lost both times, and just got evicted from his last apartment by his Asian landlord.  Shocker, she&#39;s racist too, so it wasn&#39;t his fault he missed the rent check because he couldn&#39;t go to work.  We were at Target last week, later he told me the cashier looked &quot;down&quot; at him, so she&#39;s no doubt racist and would never date a black guy.</p>

<p>So yea, you&#39;re spot on, again.  Take away the victim card and that MOUNTAIN of responsibility falls squarely on HIS shoulders.  No one else&#39;s, and that&#39;s too scary for him, and no doubt everyone else who wears the race card on their sleeve.  I can&#39;t get a job and take care of myself because everyone else is racist.  So it isn&#39;t my fault.</p>

<p>(In Tony&#39;s defense, there was one dude who was racist, but he was just some nobody we gamed with.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there will always be an idiot racist here and there. The media would have us believe every white person who&#39;s not a democrat runs around in a hood burning crosses and denying jobs to black. We&#39;re all getting fucked people. Some more than others, sure. But we need to unite against the fuckers in government and in the media, particularly the left, who exacerbate this shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed when it&#39;s a cop shooting someone every one is freaking out, yet there is 7 killed and 29 wounded in one weekend in Chicago and no one gives a shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who says no one gives a shit? I&#39;m black and plenty of people care about gang violence. Plenty of people talk about it and try to find solutions. There are organizations in my city and tons of majority black cities that do their best to help. Plenty of times in my life I&#39;ve seen others lectured and been lectured / pulled to the side and told by older people about stopping violence and staying away from gangs and crime. So where does his narrative come from that no one cares? And why do you believe them? are you black? There are no protests for gang violence because that&#39;s not a problem that can be easily solved by a protest because it&#39;s socioeconomical / poverty. Whereas a cop killing an unarmed man is a systematic problem.</p>

<p>Anyone participating in gang violence has most the time hit rock bottom in their life and will die at a young age. They get arrested all the time and end up in prison. Their life is shit and ends short. A cop kills a black dude cause he&#39;s having a rough day and goes home, sleeps and comes into work the next day and does it again with no consequences and support from Americans in general with the attitude of &quot;he was probably a violent nigger anyways&quot;. Of course people are angrier at that than gang violence...</p>

<p>Mike Brown was like the mentos in a coke bottle for frustrations all over the board but police brutality is a specifically tough and emotional one.</p>

<p>Let me ask you something, why do people constantly try to divert attention away from the cops wrongdoing and to a completely separate issue?</p>

<p>No one talks about gang violence and midway through the conversation goes &quot;but forget all that, what about police brutality?&quot;. It&#39;s separate. But the reverse happens and all white people want to talk about is Chicago even though they damn sure don&#39;t do shit for Chicago themselves. </p>

<p>tldr : People dont protest gang violence because gang members get punished with prison or death, cops get away with murder and get a nice salary for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unsubstantiated and thus to be taken with a grain of salt, but basically it claims to be the confession of a &quot;music industry insider&quot; who says that in 1991 he attended a closed door meeting with other &quot;insiders&quot;.  He says the meeting was organized by people he had never seen before and that everyone there had to sign an agreement saying if they disclosed anything they heard there that they would be fired.  At the meeting, they talked about popularizing a new style of rap music that focused on drugs and violence, aka &quot;gangsta rap&quot;, in order to maximize the number of prisoners in their new private prison industry and, thus, their profits.  He says that they were told they could invest in prison stock themselves and thus could personally benefit from proliferating gangster rap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this sub but the range is too wide. </p>

<p>We go from a serious questioning of a certain event and discrepancies, straight to &quot;THEY&#39;RE all ACTORS!&quot; accompanied by a terrible compilation of so called actors in major tragic events. And then before you know it, it&#39;s a false flag.</p>

<p>i feel like there&#39;s no middle ground here, it&#39;s not possible and it kills this sub.</p>

<p>We attract trolls and there is almost never a constructive discussion, just endless one-liners followed by 2 page posts without a tl;dr..</p>

<p>It&#39;s either a thread of accusations of the other user or a circle jerk. </p>

<p>I&#39;m critical of the govt. but i don&#39;t think every tragedy needs to be held under the conspiracy magnifying glass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really think a lot (not all, but a LOT) of the &quot;they&#39;re all actors&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s ALL a hoax, case closed!&quot; stuff is planted. It takes people&#39;s eyes off the ball of real conspiracies, keeps &quot;regular people&quot; from truly investigating fishy situations as they get herded into lumping any questioners in with the really outlandish theories.</p>

<p>Take the Boston Marathon, for example. A reasonable person might put two and two together, apparently perpetrated by a guy who was kicked out of his mosque for acting all jihad-jihad krrrrraaaazy (a hallmark trait of an FBI informant if you read the articles about that stuff), when the grounds were literally crawling with agents and private security contractors of the ex-SEAL variety. One might jump to a theory wondering if, perhaps, the entire thing was supposed to be caught at the very last minute in a big fanfare of &quot;Wow, aren&#39;t we awesome! Increase our funding!&quot; but something went awry (my new favorite out-there, implausible theory: Russia got pissed with our fucking with Chechnya and swapped out the backpacks). One might conclude, huh, there&#39;s a good chance this is an op that went seriously, seriously awry. Heads. Should. Roll.</p>

<p>But instead, serious discussion gets overrun with &quot;IT was a hoax! No ONE died! Look at my arrows!&quot; Then, Edward Snowden releases his load. No one&#39;s talking about FBI fuckups now. NSA&#39;s the bad guy. Never you mind that they share data. </p>

<p>And any time anyone brings the marathon up, conversations get overrun with &quot;It was a HOAX!&quot; &quot;It was not, you conspiracy people are kraaaaazy!&quot; &quot;What? This YouTube is incontrovertible!! Watch this YouTube!&quot; (Read the revelations from this week to explain why you shouldn&#39;t open any random YouTube someone sends you: <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/15/cat-video-hack/">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/15/cat-video-hack/</a>) and no real estate goes to much more likely theories (that actually have legit precedent).</p>

<p>Also, many times that I post something like what I&#39;ve written above, I get a lot of downvotes and sometimes some pretty trolly abuse, take that as you will - I find it an interesting canary.</p>

<p>This has been an issue since about 2002/2003, when the US shoved all the money at the military, and the military bought a bunch of new stuff and had surplus. So then they said &quot;Hey, you know who also fights bad guys and needs weapons? Police!&quot; It&#39;s been in the public eye ever since then, but nobody really does anything about it because what politician says &quot;You know what we need? Weaker cops! I&#39;m sure crime won&#39;t increase!&quot; It doesn&#39;t matter that violent crime is on the decline; that&#39;s political suicide. So it takes some huge event like this one to make politicians act. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i appreciate what you say here.</p>

<p>i think the point you may be missing however is that even CNN and NBC news describe the decisionmaking that goes into our laws and military actions as a conspiracy.</p>

<p>-laws are written and brought to vote or not in secret meetings
-elections are financed by secret meetings
-who is assassinated by drones is decided by secret meetings
-how we as citizens are spied on by our government is a secret meeting
-the military budget has no check or balance, it is secret
-the price and availability if commodities, secret meetings
-the decision of what will even be news, secret meetings
-the decision of what will be a tv show or movie, secret meetings
-the genetics of our food, secret meetings
-the banking and money supply, secret meetings
-emergency response contingency plans, secret meetings
-trade agreements, secret meetings</p>

<p>it is abundantly clear to me and it should be to everyone that its not a matter of whether on conspiracy is real or not but that regardless of when it became this way, we as a nation teh usa are actually governed completely by conspiracy.</p>

<p>conspiracy is not just something that happens on occasion, it is in fact our form of government and it is past time for people to begin living in this reality and leave the fairy tale idea that this is some venerable republic that deserves respect and honor.</p>

<p>only then enough people be able to stand up against it and create an actual functioning society after demolishing the pile of heavily armed idiocy that we know today as our government.</p>

<p>And yeah, they make tasers and mace for a reason. Particularly, to not kill teenagers/dogs/autistic kids, etc. Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a cop though. You can kill anyone, get a vacation, and be found innocent. Murder by cop is incentivized by the system.</p>
