       The term was weaponized by the CIA in response to those that questioned the Warren Commission in regards to president Kennedy's assassination, this is on record through a 1976 FOIA request of CIA Document 1035-960.  I think a better term would be "Conspiracy Analyst."

       An even better word still would simply be "critical thinker".  Period.  The word "conspiracy", as you correctly noted, has been purposefully maligned by TPTB.  Much better to simply not associate oneself with it to any real extent.

       I've confronted some people about this, asking them why do they feel this way towards "conspiracy theorists." Most of them say, "because they are crazy" or "they seem to believe everything."
      </p>
      <p>
       When they say this, I ask them do they believe everything that the government or media tells them. If they say yes, then well.. lost cause there. If they say no, then I ask them why is it so strange to think other people seek the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the gullible bit, I usually turn it on them and say if you always believe what the government/media tell you, doesn't that make you the gullible one? After all, we've all seen how they both have been wrong and flat-out lie to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       They usually walk away with some kind of "hmmmm" moment. The key is to not attack them, but rather ask them questions to engage their own thinking. You have to make them realize it, you can't force it on them.

       That's an excellent way to approach all discussions in general, and you're right, questions and getting them thinking is all you can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, along those same lines ;), I wanted to ask about your phrasing of the question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        do they believe everything that the government or media tells them
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think you're creating a false dichotomy here. I believe certain things from the gov't, and I take others with a grain of salt understanding there's going to be bias. But it's not 100% either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think conspiracy theorists and non-c-theorists are both guilty of sweeping generalizations -- no, not all theories are completely out there, and no, not every piece of news coming from MSM is the product of a puppet-master.

       Cognitive Dissonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most law abiding people in the US want to believe that they are good people.  And they've been raised to believe that those in power are uniformly good. To them, it just wouldn't be possible for a suddam hussien or Osama Bin Laden to be a police cheif or president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when whack jobs like us say the CIA killed our president(kennedy) or that 9/11 was an inside job, it breaks everything they've been taught.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when I first started reading about the legitimate F'd up stuff the gooberment was doing, I felt really paranoid. I was like, "holy shit, they know I know". I felt like Everything I was taught has been a lie. What do you mean we would attack our own people in order to start a war with someone else??? My mind at the time couldn't handle it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So lets have some compassion for these people. In order for them to be aware of whats really going on, they will have to want to willingly accept the red pill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest maybe just bringing up solo events that have been thoroughly documented. Like James Clapper lying to congress. "Hey man, he lied on camera straight to congress, don't you think others might do it to others if they knew they could get away with it? just saying."

       In "The Pervert's Guide to Ideology," Zizek perfectly illustrates one of the reasons why in a critique of "They Live," specifically the scene in which John Nada must physically fight his best friend for a protracted period of time in an attempt to get him to wear the sunglasses and to see the hidden truth underlying everything.

       Well, speaking as someone outside the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       community, I would say that my opposition isn't "vehement," and that it mostly stems from what I see to be a general "all-or-nothing" set of beliefs emanating from this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wholeheartedly do I believe that critical thinking and cognizance of bias from authority are healthy and important traits, but I've seen a distinct lack of discernment between plausible/worthwhile topics and those that lack true merit (e.g. The Bush Family's Involvement with Saudi Arabia vs I dunno, the Ebola-vaccine conspiracy theory).
      </p>
      <p>
       One more thing, the level of conviction that people have of certain theories here is a little...hypocritical? I've gotten into discussions where I concede that I think [insert theory here] is
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       , but that given [evidence I've researched on my own] don't think is likely, whereas the response I receive is "[theory] is
       <strong>
        undeniable, absolute fact
       </strong>
       and if you don't believe so you've got wool over your eyes." Without being an expert with access to
       <em>
        all of the facts
       </em>
       , no one, conspiracy theorists or non, can be 100% sure about their beliefs.

       They have been taught to consider anyone related to so-called "conspiracy theories" to be foolish. People don't like to be foolish, or in a position where they might be "tricked" so they ridicule the thing they don't understand as a defense against this.

       I liken it to the religious fundamentalist arguing with an atheist.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how many incidents can be strung together to show a possible nefarious or malfeasant action on the part of three or more people, it goes against a longtime predisposition or belief that "people in government just aren't that &lt;adjective&gt;."
      </p>
      <p>
       The most absurd is that our government is too inept to be able to pull off heists like the level of things considered. Yet they cannot consider that the government may only look inept for the most part; the part that matters we don't see.

       The controversial nature of our discussions make us adathemas. This is because people are comfortable with the official narrative that our State is there for our protection, and they find a kind of solemn complacency in the pleasure to lick the hand that feeds so that they can be lazy and ignorant. all that matters is that they get their paycheck on payday.

       We are crazy to them just how Galileo seemed crazy when he proposed heliocentrism.  Just like Aristotle when he argued the earth was found-not flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, some of us are actually crazy and stupid. Some of us are assholes. Some of us are trolls. Some of us are even racist, and use "Zionist" as a cover to hide their antisemetic antics. These are also reasons why some folks seem to hate us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those same people that vehenemently hate our sub also don't take the time or place the effort to find the diamonds in the rough. So, if they allow a small handful of users who portray those negative attributes I listed above to represent the entire whole of the sub, then fuck them. That's how I see it.

       By allowing conspiracy theories in your thinking, you add lots of uncertainty. Humans want to either be in control or to understand. When both are diminished they feel exposed, a classic human archetype that is deeply seeded, relating to being naked, being cold, exposed to animals, dirt, etc.

       They simply are psychologically unable to open up pandora's box because they will go insane without constraints. They live their entire lives without looking at reality, so when their ordered illusions are dissolved they have no clue what to do. It is the fear of the unknown and an inability to assess reality due to atrophy.
      </p>
      <p>
       They just need to get over it for their own good. Conspiracies are entirely possible and so one must assume that they definitely exist. If you do not believe that they can exist, you are literally insane. The more people that get this the better.

       Because more times than not, they're a group that draws wild conclusions based on no evidence. And then there's the fringe who act upon those beliefs by harassing families of victims or shooting cops.

       I would argue that that slice of conspiracy theorists is far smaller than perception and mainstream labeling dictates. In this sub if wild conclusions are drawn the top comments are always skeptical or flat out debunking. Conspiracy theorists are painted as ideologues, and while maybe the loudest ones are, the vast majority of people who, say, question the events of 9/11 are simply that, question askers and people who mistrust the corporate/state narrative. Patriotism is an ideology, conspiracy theories are just that, a collection of theories.

       It is very simple. The legitimate conspiracy theories are overshadowed by the obviously and intentionally fake ones that are made to offended reasonably minded people. People would be much more open to questioning the status quo if it didn't come from people that believe 9/11 was an "inside job", the moon landings were faked, Sandy Hook was a false flag and the government is coming for our guns, or other such nonsense. If the legitimate concerns were separated from the lunatics that use the word "Zionist", and think that reptiles are going to implant us with tracking chips, they wouldn't meet with such opposition. Guilt by association. Purge the paranoid hate-mongers.
