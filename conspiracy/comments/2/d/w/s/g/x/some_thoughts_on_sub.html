        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This sub is called <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> .</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.be/?gws_rd=ssl#q=conspiracy">Google search on the word conspiracy</a> </p>

<ul>
<li>First hit is a wiki for <a href="https://www.google.be/?gws_rd=ssl#q=conspiracy">conspiracy <em>theory</em></a> not <em>conspiracy</em> I find this pretty annoying. </li>
<li>Checked some <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conspiracy">english dictionaries</a> and some translations in my <a href="http://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/samenzwering">native tongue</a> to really understand the meaning of the word. </li>
</ul>

<p>I think the definition of conspiracy could be; &quot;A secretive attempt to organize something unlawful.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>A secretive attempt to organize something unlawful.</strong> Let&#39;s break that down.</p>

<ul>
<li>Secretive: Is it really secretive when we know where they meet, who they are and what their motives are?</li>
<li>Attempt: well <em>they</em> don&#39;t really attempt anything, do they, they anticipate, plan, react, seize opportunities. </li>
<li>Organize: Like any other business conglomerate they have meetings about the general direction but then everybody probably just does what serves them best.</li>
<li>Unlawful: This is the most interesting one. What they&#39;re doing is not unlawful because they financially support politicians that favor their needs. Nothing unlawful is going on and if there is, some executive will be blamed. </li>
</ul>

<p>The longer i&#39;ve been here the more i&#39;m beginning to think there is no actual global conspiracy, they&#39;re just a bunch of incredibly <strong>wealthy, powerful opportunists</strong> who help each other out. But there is no global plan. There is no &#39;secretive attempt to organize something unlawful&#39; because the large part of what this privileged elite does is <em>legal</em>. </p>

<p>I believe in people and organizations conspiring, what I don&#39;t believe in is a global conspiracy from a select elite that <strong>have a plan.</strong> Not because it can&#39;t be done logistically, it can&#39;t be done because of this one factor; the people involved; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The scale of commodities with which they &#39;play&#39; has made them so out of touch with humanity. Such sociopaths can&#39;t stick to a plan because the closer they get to the completion, the more paranoid they become. Eventually they&#39;ll turn on each other. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I marked that as quoted just because.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plain and simple, a conspiracy is a secret plan.</p>

<p>You wonder &quot;is it really secretive&quot;.</p>

<p>MSM gives the &#39;official story&quot; of a subject according to what a government deems fit for the public to know, no more and no less. We here at r/conspiracy , doubt some of the &#39;official stories&#39;. We believe somebody is hiding some truth. We obviously differ and disagree on the truth might be, but that doesn&#39;t matter (in terms of fulfilling the purpose and the meaning of the word conspiracy).</p>

<p>Most of the subjects of our conspiracy suspicions, DO &quot;attempt to organize something unlawful&quot;. Or at least, that&#39;s what our belief is. It can stem from paranoia or pessimism as some will accuse anyone interested in the subject. It can however, come from substantiated well sourced material or experience like learning from modern history.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen trolls recently mockingly say they were &#39;here to uncover the truth and expose the government&#39;. By no means are we investigators, or claim to have any authority or breakthroughs. Not at all. We are spectators, trying to learn for our own interests.</p>

<p>I personally dislike subjects like the existence of aliens or ancient civilizations, etc. I feel that if these stories are about discovery or mystery, and doesn&#39;t suggest conspirers, it&#39;s not a conspiracy and personally would not welcome it here. The subject is interesting, but misplaced.</p>

<p>As for the last bit of your OP, you&#39;re disagreeing with one conspiracy. That&#39;s fine. It&#39;s an opinion, not that controversial. It doesn&#39;t prove nor deny anything. I&#39;m don&#39;t believe in the existence of a small group of elites dictating how the world should work, as well. But I do believe it&#39;s way more possible than you make it sound.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh ok that makes sense.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think conspiracies and conspiracy theories are separated. I think all the stories, theories and actual facts are intertwined. </p>

<p>The point i&#39;m trying to make is that the global conspiracy  we&#39;re posting and documenting here is not as organized as we believe.</p>

<p>I keep seeing cracks, i keep seeing desperate attempts to cover up fuck ups because; <strong>let&#39;s say there&#39;s a global elite, that elite still depends on grunts to carry out their commands</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with your assertion that everything they do is legal. While it is true that they pass legislation to &quot;legalise&quot; their actions, these laws themselves are unlawful. They go against the constitution, and therefore are to be considered null and void and unenforceable. What is happening is not lawful. Not one bit. It is completely unconstitutional. </p>

<p>They do not have the constitutional authority to pass on the powers granted to them to another entity or branch. Yet they are doing this. But, I&#39;ll stop on this part.</p>

<p>As for the global plan, I think it would be disingenuous to claim they don&#39;t have that as part of their agenda. Think about it. If you were of the most wealthy people in the world, and you affluence could buy souls, and you had a symbiotic relationship shared with all the other super wealthy folks and top leaders, why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> you try to keep that train rolling? </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t rich because they are empathetic/sympathetic. They are rich because they are controlled by  their gluttony. Nothing is ever enough for them. Not until they acquire the entire world. </p>

<p>Of course, consider this my personal opinion, and I admit that I could be wrong, and I will dually note that you could be right. But, until we know for sure, I choose to disagree.</p>

<p>Well thats a different argument then :-) I havent thought about it in this fashion as of yet. So thanks for the brain food! </p>

<p>And yes, i admit that while their laws are technically unconstithtional, that will never stop them from saying just the opposite. Effectively what they do is legal only because the corrupt system they have installed in place of our constitutional republic says it is legal. We can make the argument that our current system of government is no longer a constitutional republic, and thusly what they do is legal. I can accept that. </p>

<p>I just dont like how we as a country have turned our backs on the one thing that allowed us to be great in the first place. But i guess this part is a different discussion as well...</p>

<p>But anyways, thanks for clearing it up! I understand whst you were trying to say better now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t directly think of an example, but bear with me on this scenario which frankly can&#39;t be ruled out as too crazy to happen.  Suppose Israel keeps pushing forward with their goal of Palestinian eradication and expansion of Israel&#39;s borders well into the Middle Eastern states, and with big brother U.S.&#39;s aid, succeeds.  How long before the state of Israel becomes paranoid that the U.S. Might decide to swoop in and take those newly claimed lands for itself?  We&#39;ve seen already the depravity of the minds of Israel, that kind of depravity doesn&#39;t just quell itself, in fact only compounding in it&#39;s severity.  Hell, eventually the higher ups in the Israeli government could potentially turn amongst themselves as their paranoia begins to heighten.  I digress.  Once Israel hypothetically controls the Middle East, the shady eye would most likely then be cast at big brother America, which would lead to who the fuck knows what, worst case a Nuclear War.  Maybe I&#39;m off base a bit, I dunno.  But I enjoy speculation and hypotheticals.</p>

<p>No of course not but wanting something and getting something are not the same.</p>

<p>You ignore the possiblity that what is organizing the global conspiracy may not be human, or may not consist of living human individuals. It may be a group consciousness, for example. It may even be demonic, or alien.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let&#39;s say that is possible.</p>

<p><em>They</em> are still using people to achieve their goal, people are emotional and greedy. If <em>they</em> (whoever that is) have a global plan, they&#39;re certainly not counting on the elite to complete it. </p>

<p>If they&#39;re more powerful than us i&#39;m sure they&#39;ve explored this option and ruled it out. The human, the elite cannot complete the plan. I think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then perhaps <em>they</em> are simply using the elites and their psychosis to set up a chaotic stormfront while they meanwhile storm in amidst the chaos and instill their own master plan.  I don&#39;t necessarily believe this, but at one point I actually believed Israel was our ally, and I was wrong.  I&#39;ve learned to consider any and all possibilities, given the sheer carnal chaos possessed by humankind.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say <strong>they</strong> control the human elite and are using the human elite for as long as <strong>they</strong> see fit.</p>

<p>Then i still think we can agree on the fact that the human elite is simply not emotionally equipped to stick to a global plan of world domination</p>

<p>Yes, i completely agree, regarding the incompetence and the need to stop them.</p>

<p>But i am losing faith in the ability of this sub to bring change. I understand that is not the reason this sub exists but, if not for change then what are we doing here? Why are we posting here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel this sub is great for looking under the veil that the mainstream is trying to put onto everything.  Using this sub as an information hub is probably the best bet.  The best way to get down to change is telling the ones you want changed what&#39;s wrong.  Getting down and dirty, staring adversity in it&#39;s face and saying &quot;Enough of this bullshit.&quot;  Reading posts and getting information, commenting and discussing is productive and useful, but proactivity is better sought at the source.  Your voice will not be heard by those that need to hear it if you keep your voice here.  Those that need to hear it do not want to hear it and will not seek it out here.  Put it in their face.  Voice your disdain.  I don&#39;t look at this sub as a source of change.  This sub is a source of awareness.  I use it to keep my eyes open.  Awareness is the first step to change.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why i frequent here but you have to really separate the weeds from the chaff.</p>

<p>Ok i get that but compare this sub to any other. With any other sub it&#39;s like; &quot;i need to know this or that, i&#39;ll do a search, find the right sub, read sidebar and ask my question.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sometimes feels like a soap box where anything goes. And that sucks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true.  I admit it does take work to weed out things.  I also admit that technically this sub could also be used to find like minded individuals to organize movements to get their words out.  In such a way then r/conspiracy becomes a better tool towards change than just a source of information.  It becomes a hub of activity towards progress.  It just has to be utilized in such a way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what i&#39;m talking about and why i posted this, i feel like this sub attracts: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Any</strong> nutcase with a wild, undocumented theory.</li>
<li>Reposters who really think we need more info about 9/11 who, if they would&#39;ve taken the time to explore the sub, would see that a lot of topics have been widely discussed. </li>
<li>Redditors that aren&#39;t even subscribed but just hop in from time to time to have a laugh.</li>
<li>(Feel free to add...)</li>
</ul>

<p>So what&#39;s the purpose of this sub? What the actual fuck are we doing here? Don&#39;t get me wrong, this was one of the first subs i subscribed to and i still love it but, I think it can do better. </p>

<p>I&#39;m grateful for anything i can get. The people behind wiki leaks and the whistleblowers are doing some amazing work that can possibly change the future drastically. They should be worshipped. Hopefully more will appear.</p>
