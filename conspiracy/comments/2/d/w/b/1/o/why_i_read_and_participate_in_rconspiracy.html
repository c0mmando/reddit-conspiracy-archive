        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(originally from comment I made, I just thought it was worth its own post as it applies to the entire sub) </p>

<p>i think the point you may be missing however is that even CNN and NBC news describe the decisionmaking that goes into our laws and military actions as a conspiracy.</p>

<p>-laws are written and brought to vote or not in secret meetings -elections are financed by secret meetings -who is assassinated by drones is decided by secret meetings -how we as citizens are spied on by our government is a secret meeting -the military budget has no check or balance, it is secret -the price and availability of commodities, secret meetings -the decision of what will even be news, secret meetings -the decision of what will be a tv show or movie, secret meetings -the genetics of our food, secret meetings -the banking and money supply, secret meetings -emergency response contingency plans, secret meetings -trade agreements, secret meetings</p>

<p>it is abundantly clear to me and it should be to everyone that its not a matter of whether one conspiracy is real or not but that regardless of when it became this way, we as a nation teh usa are actually governed xcompletelyx primarily by conspiracy.</p>

<p>conspiracy is not just something that happens on occasion, it is in fact our form of government and it is past time for people to begin living in this reality and leave the fairy tale idea that this is some venerable republic that deserves respect and honor.</p>

<p>only then will enough people be able to stand up against it and create an actual functioning society after demolishing the pile of heavily armed idiocy that we know today as our government.</p>

<p>edit: typos, 
edit: changed &#39;completely&#39; to &#39;primarily&#39;, as in, yes local government has a lot of public meetings and decisionmaking, and certainly numerous things that are trivial will have public meetings, but of course, what property will be zoned commercial, who will get which lucrative building/operations contracts, anything beyond this level is generally just announced.</p>

But they&#39;ll disagree that anyone is actively pushing the system in that direction so they accept it for some reason. I don&#39;t get it. Who gives a fuck if it&#39;s a grand conspiracy or a bunch of shameless opportunists using government power to loot the coffers? It&#39;s bullshit and we need to expose how fucked up the system is now.</p>

<p>It can&#39;t be just an intellectual framework, it has to actually change every aspect of the way you live day to day before you can actually claim not to be supporting it, and at that time you can start actually doing things that will slow it down and eventually stop it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe that the most important pillar of the conspiracy government, the neofeudalists, the neocolonialists, and of course the fascists, is the trust the typical american has in television news channels, who have over and over revealed themselves not to deserve any credibility whatsoever.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people are really thinking until they can jettison this part of the mental framework, they are too dependant on the failing system, that obviously needs their energy to perpetuate itself.  </p>

<p>The number of new websites regardless of credibility is creating a new class of citizen journalist, or maybe the revival of the kind of micro-papers that existed at the time of the first american revolution and even the early 1900s, and in the future the dominance of the giant faux news conglomerates will be looked back upon as an aberration of headslapping stupidity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with this. Too many people feel comfortable with their lives because they come home and hear some bullshit narrative/propaganda on tv. I should say this narrative fits into the mainstream view and gets people to go &quot;of course it&#39;s that way&quot; and they brush it off. TV is still massive and a main source of news for many people (especially older people). The biggest thing you can do is do your own research on things and get more than one point of view on a subject</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;i am a debunker, always, and the united states does mostly good, always&#39; is a maddeningly simple-minded viewpoint.  </p>

<p>My approach to current events is one where I do &#39;debunk&#39; and &#39;deduce&#39; often, it&#39;s more of a process.  </p>

<p>The starting point, in most cases of big stories nowadays is that, unfortunately, the official &#39;conventional wisdom&#39; is obviously insufficient to explain events, and that obvious and simple questions go unasked in public forums.  </p>

<p>So I am the kind of person who steps in and asks those questions and if you are bothered by this kind of person, that is just a sign that you are on the &#39;hey let&#39;s all think less and blindly follow more&#39; part of the population.  </p>

<p>In times where there is a struggle for existence going on and there is a time constraint it is one thing to say &#39;hey we don&#39;t have time for questions&#39; but we happen to live in a super-peaceful place, even with all these attacks and what &#39;our&#39; soldiers are doing overseas, so we actually do have time to ask these questions.  </p>

<p>Even if there was a city destroyed in an attack, unless they are destroying city after city all day long, we have time for questions and the attitude that we don&#39;t is arbitrarily imposed madness.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The U.S. is in no way a sort of neutral Platonic state without base and mundane (including ‘subterranean’) interests. One must apply one’s skepticism realistically (which is not to say binarily or even with axiomatic impartiality/neutrality), the advancement of geopolitical power over adversaries and ‘allies’ alike is what is at play episodically and generally, humanitarian concerns and publicly circulating notions of ‘justice’ are employed by states principally to dress and address events in formulaic and Manichean cliches that promote geostrategic aims in publicly acceptable/intelligible fashion, all the while maintaining an ‘inhuman’ hyperrational eye on the abstractive fundamental concerns of sovereign and elite power; this is called, quite simply, raison d’état and has been an unnegatable theoretical (not to mention practical) factor in the study and exercise of power since the time of Machiavelli.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, that&#39;s why I put the &#39;&#39; around &#39;our&#39; soldiers. </p>

<p>But when I say our food, I am saying that I include myself with everybody buying food at supermarkets in this country, and many countries where these kinds of sham laws are in place, letting mad scientists concoct whatever to test on us without us having any way to know what the long term effects will be.  </p>

<p>By me claiming it is our food supply, I am also saying that it is not theirs to do with as they please.  If I said I was just concerned about my food, that wouldn&#39;t be very compelling.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been our form of government for a very, <em>very</em> long time. We&#39;re just now figuring it out.</p>

<p>The implications of that are utterly staggering. I&#39;m a bright, 40yo man, with a masters degree in engineering, and I have to admit that I know nothing about history, science, medicine... really anything. I&#39;m doing it all over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is truly humbling, as someone who spent all that time getting AP credits in high school, that I have to admit, for all the news I&#39;ve watched, the first thing I have to say about governance on earth is that it intentionally hidden from me, and that all the official stories and processes that are taught to children are mirages.  </p>

<p>I can honestly not rule out body-snatcher/V/the arrival/puppetmaster governance, that our rulers are even human is something I cannot claim for absolute fact.  The distance and security of their lives is so perfectly held, and the system of information conveyance is so corrupt and manipulatable, I don&#39;t even know how in my lifetime I could set even such basic assumptions for certain.  </p>

<p>And that is, after all, the number one reason against monarchy/fascism/oligarchy/plutarchy/theocracy, it is the easiest form of government for people from outside of the country or planet to take over with a single operation.  It is incredibly weak, it the easiest way for an entire nation to be enslaved and in many cases still think they are free.  </p>

<p>I decided to drop out of engineering because I wasn&#39;t learning knowledge, I was jumping through hoops and understanding itself was discouraged.  I looked at all of the companies at the job fair and could not be at all certain my efforts wouldn&#39;t go towards war and creating new kinds of shackles. </p>

<p>One of my friends&#39; dad was an engineer, he designed a way, as he explained it, for diagnostics of train crossing signals to be transmitted back to the company over unused cell phone tower bandwidth.  I have seen no evidence of those being implemented, but that technology is how the ankle bracelet monitors for people on parole operate.  </p>

<p>It is a spooky time to be giving the people in power new gadgetry, at least with my writing I can, if I&#39;m doing it right, further ideas that by their very nature are subversive to illegitimate governance, but of late, so many solid tactics of anti-authoritarians have been used by authoritarians, even these words and this thread may give them even more power, I honestly don&#39;t know for sure, it&#39;s a gamble.  </p>

<p>But if I&#39;m going to cast a bet, I&#39;ll cast one first on the ideas in my own head and my right to express them.  Like hell if I&#39;m going to be silent while all this is going down.  I hope you do the same.   </p>
