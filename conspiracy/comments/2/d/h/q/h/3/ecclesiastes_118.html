       "For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow."
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone else feel this way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Thanks for all the responses, they were very helpful. Folks who responded reminded me of a couple more verses which may be solid guidance to those on this sub:
      </p>
      <p>
       John 16:13: Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 John 5:19: We know we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the [power of the] wicked one. The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole obligation of man. - Ecclesiastes 12:13.  2
      </p>
      <p>
       Corinthians 12:9-10 But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joshua 1:9 ESV Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       1 John 4:18 ESV There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ephesians 5:11 Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.

       It's basically the inverse of the old adage, "Ignorance is bliss."
      </p>
      <p>
       Both statements are true, in my opinion. But that's basically the most positive I can get about it. Ignorance is bliss.
      </p>
      <p>
       I choose to be knowledgeable as much as I can. I believe I can handle whatever sorrow comes from gaining wisdom. I'm cool with that, because I find pleasure in knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can find peace in knowing things despite the sorrow that comes with it, I'd suggest keeping true to yourself. Or maybe you can filter out the sorrow somehow?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I believe the Chinese yin and yang touch on this idea as well. Light and darkness is and always will be intertwined.

       No. Machivellian ideology simply insist that you do whatever you have to do to impose your will upon people. That's it. It is amoral, so good and bad are not even a part of the process. Life is not about me. No matter what one accomplishes, he will never be totally fulfilled. I do understand you thoughts here, and I do sound like I was trolling. I apologize for that. I was simply trying to spark dialogue.

       In order to correctly understand the context, something called heurmoneutics needs to be applied. The small book "How To Read The Bible For All That It Is Worth" is an affordable and digestable resource that lives in my very modest library. I once pursued a Biblical Studies degree. Heurmonuetics is/should be a 1000 lvl class. It explains the need for proper exegesis. That is true no matter one's faith or lack thereof. What you will discover is that you will need MORE books and tools. Some of these are found online at biblehub.com. Just a little FYI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things to take into account: Author, audience, book type (epistle, law, eschatological, etc), form, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, learning how to use an Interlinear Bible, Strong's Concordance, and etymological resources help us to find the firm meaning of certain words. An example is the word 'wisdom' in Ecc 1:18. The Hebrew root is ·∏•ƒÅ·∏µ-mƒÅh. It means wisdom (in a good sense) -- skilful, wisdom, wisely, wit. In this light, wisdom should be understood as a learned skillset or rather the philosophy or theory of (as in music theory).

       Also, the Bible states that Solomon (author and king) was the wisest man that ever lived. We are also told of his pagan/occult years. What matters, in my mind, regarding Solomon is his converse between Ecc. and Proverbs. Its fluid and beautiful even in English (and even if you are a non-believer). I recommend the NASB, NRSV, or MSG (Message v. is not as literal in translation, but I like it here.) Here is a NASB link to Ecc 1. Start at 1:1 and read thru chapter 7. Navigate chapters/pages by using the blue triangles located on left and right margins.

      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Ecc. 1:18, Solomon is simply NOT saying the obvious-
       <strong>
        ignorance reigns supreme
       </strong>
       . Education is skilled wisdom. Most people fail to see the urgency, moral dilemma, and meaning to all of the world's evils. Solomon was educated. He was a king; however, 1-2 generations before Solomon we find a highly barbaric people. The rulers of that day seem to be warlords more than kings/royalty. And these were an unlearned illiterate people as well. The more insight one gathers - in an ignorant society/nation - the more it grieves ones heart because nothing can truly fix what is set in motion. Optimism is not a great exercise, as it only makes one feel impotent. If you will read this entire book, you will discover how Solomon reconciles it all. If you read the next book, Songs of Solomon, you'll discover that this King of Israel was black and proud. And very very horny.

       My advice since you asked- Don't let things that you have no real control over run your life, or keep you in a state of exhaustion. The political, economic, and social landscape is not for anyone person to reduce themself to confused frustration or perpetual grief. Hug your family, do the next right thing (whatever that may be), never let fear silence your heart, and with humility understand that everyone is the keeper of their own integrity.

       Before eugenics, transdimentional Tom Cruises rebranded,and war, we must be human to one another. Or what's the point in this damn thing? Those are my truest thoughts. If eugenics, technology, conspiracy galore could extend an otherwise terminal species or planet, give me humanity. The opposite of humanity now has a true and bold face. We call them Zionists, but John at Patmos penned them as "Satanists posing to be Jews". And thats what they are. And, this is knowledge/prophecy that Solomon was aware of when lamented.

       Sure thing. You may be interested in at least looking into the unshakable truth that exists and my mortal enemy - amorality. Once I fully grasped what such a thing was (It was foreign initially and took time to marinate), and eventually I grasped what that mind is like. There is not one greater example of an author, teacher, or intro into this than Niccolo Machiavelli. The Prince is the starting point, but this film, perhaps an Oxford Companion to his works (or similar) is just as efficient. If you want a copy of the book, not all translations are equal. This is explains Zionism and the Devil Himself. A must imo-

       A student of the Bible should get acquainted with this mind. So much will become evident. Machiavelli was a genius. Its amazing really.

       That's interesting man, I have The Prince already. They had us buy it for a class and I must have dropped the class, but I still have the book. I tried reading it once, but you're right, it really was difficult to grasp. Soon perhaps, I shall try again.

       Oh, if you've seen any Terry Gilliam then you can probably already get a good feel for it. I found it fantastic. Definitely made to be accessible to a wider audience. Funny, absurd; a good mirror to how a lot of americans are currently living their lives. It's an absolute feast for your eyes. If you're insane, then this film might make you incredibly uncomfortable. I posted this in an Ecclesiastes thread because its philosophy is clearly a part of the film, and the main character is Cohen Leth (Coheleth). HIGHly recommended.

       Terry Gilliam has some awesome stuff. I just watched the Fisher King a few weeks back, I didn't know until now that he directed that. I'd recommend that one if you're looking for a good movie. Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges, it also mirrors capitalistic society quite well. I'll have to track down 'The Zero Theorem' somewhere too. Thanks!

       Perhaps it speaks to those who are afraid of wisdom. The more you obtain wisdom, or the sight of experience you will soon find that you have very few peers. It is not sad to acquire wisdom or to strive for knowledge. It is sad because of how very few of us wish to do just that.

       I know what you mean there. Once, I made the mistake of discussing some of it with my parents and they didn't respond very well. It's tough to inform folks about knowledge, whether true of false, that will inevitably challenge their peace of mind.

       I think the words have truth in them (like contextual truth - not any sort of higher truth), the more you understand the more pain and sadness you encounter.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a fundamentally bad thing, sorrow and pain - although not healthy things to surround yourself in, are elements of the world and the better you understand them, and perceive them, the broader your ability to judge your actions and the actions of others.

       Thanks man, I appreciate it. I find divine truth in the Bible, but I've found that it can be subjective depending on a persons receptiveness. You're right about experience though, most definitely, how can one know light if they've never experienced darkness.

       From my perspective, I identify with that statement a lot. I'm aware of how corrupt the world is and of the constant bullshit that surrounds me but I feel at a loss to change it so for the most part. So it makes me sort of depressed and angry. The "sheeple" can be happy in their ignorance. Ignorance is bliss right? At the same time, I'd rather know and maybe be able to prepare even if the prep is for nothing then just be caught completely off guard and hope I make it.

       It's hard to live with such a jaded archive of knowledge. In fact, it's amazing to me that there aren't MORE suicides then there are. I have no idea why Robin Williams chose to kill himself, but honestly, I can hardly blame him with the state of the world. I'd rather fight then just give up though. If you might die either way, might as well fight on the way out. Who knows what a small difference can snowball into?

Ecclesiastes 1:2
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, we should not take this to mean that life is meaningless, but rather the pursuit of earthly possessions, and the respect of others is.
      </p>

       I am a conspiracy theorist christian who is convinced most of the politicians running the my country and Israel are satanists who have their populations fooled.  Take comfort in Jesus and the belief that there will be a day of judgement.  Live in such a way that when you stand before your creator you can be proud of what your words and actions show.  Thats my best advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some of God's advice:
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Corinthians 12:9-10
But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.  That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joshua 1:9 ESV
Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       1 John 4:18 ESV
There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.

       Thanks a lot. Those are very relevant verses, much appreciated. Man, I wasn't sure there were many of us out there. I've found that this stuff really can challenge my faith and has many times, but I just know what Christ has done is sufficient to guide those who believe to do God's will.

       I agree, but what I've done is try to use all of the information I've learned about conspiracies to be a better person. I care more about my community, I try to listen to people without dismissing them prematurely. I try to put into the universe what I want to get out of it befcuase that's all I can do as an individual.

       That's a good way to treat it, especially hearing people out.. Occasionally, I feel like some of the information I've received might just be too touchy, or too hot too handle, for some people. I hate telling someone about something then find out they really didn't want to know and them thinking, "Well, now that my mind's been blown up how do you expect me to be able react differently than you did? Without fear." I just don't want to spread fear, I've felt it too many times to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's one reason I know Jesus Christ must be the guide. Since we're all spiritual slaves, it must be better to have the perfect master than be a slave to sin and destruction. He is the one which overcame this place and can help us to do the same, if we follow His Spirit, which will guide us to be able to decipher the truth and give us the courage to do something about what we can and the serenity to accept that not all things are within our control. Thanks for the response man.

       If you want good wisdom and knowledge I will offer to you what is from above- revelation, the Urantia book offers to all a further hope in the truth of Christs example of life on our planet. Please check out this link to learn more than you ever knew about human history, the divine architecture of the universe and master universe, the true nature of the Lucifer rebellion, and much more in 196 titled papers- how higher order beings were mandated by heaven to reveal to us a better understanding of the life in flesh of our creator son who was Jesus of Nazareth and the surrounding conditions up to the first moment of all existence led up to the conditions that existed on our planet when he came.

       I think the word crazy is inappropriate, the word amazing is more appropriate. It is not crazy because it really presents the most complete chronology of our planetary history anywhere. Something that is "crazy" is so because it is incoherent- shattered. There is nothing I am aware of in the urantia book that at all contradicts good science, philosophy, or theology.

       I was only summarizing- of course my summary is no more scientific than your claim "it claims black people are "more evolved" than whites" -- what do you even mean "more evolved"?? Is a man more evolved than an amoeba just because of structural complexity? I think not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what the Urantia book says in summary about the evolution of man and his cousins.
      </p>
      <p>
       The great event of this glacial period was the evolution of primitive man. Slightly to the west of India, on land now under water and among the offspring of Asiatic migrants of the older North American lemur types, the dawn mammals suddenly appeared. These small animals walked mostly on their hind legs, and they possessed large brains in proportion to their size and in comparison with the brains of other animals. In the seventieth generation of this order of life a new and higher group of animals suddenly differentiated. These new mid-mammals ‚Äî almost twice the size and height of their ancestors and possessing proportionately increased brain power ‚Äî had only well established themselves when the Primates, the third vital mutation, suddenly appeared. (At this same time, a retrograde development within the mid-mammal stock gave origin to the simian ancestry; and from that day to this the human branch has gone forward by progressive evolution, while the simian tribes have remained stationary or have actually retrogressed.)
      </p>
      <p>
       (700.3) 61:6.2 1,000,000 years ago Urantia was registered as an inhabited world. A mutation within the stock of the progressing Primates suddenly produced two primitive human beings, the actual ancestors of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       (700.4) 61:6.3 This event occurred at about the time of the beginning of the third glacial advance; thus it may be seen that your early ancestors were born and bred in a stimulating, invigorating, and difficult environment. And the sole survivors of these Urantia aborigines, the Eskimos, even now prefer to dwell in frigid northern climes.
      </p>
      <p>
       (700.5) 61:6.4 Human beings were not present in the Western Hemisphere until near the close of the ice age. But during the interglacial epochs they passed westward around the Mediterranean and soon overran the continent of Europe. In the caves of western Europe may be found human bones mingled with the remains of both tropic and arctic animals, testifying that man lived in these regions throughout the later epochs of the advancing and retreating glaciers.
      </p>

      <p>
       If spiritual entities really did give us a planetary history book that also helps us with spiritual ascension, I don't want anyone to miss it. I don't want anyone to lose faith in god because they were born into a religion that is unscientific and based on faulty recordings of ancient priests..
      </p>

       God loves us all and wants us to progressively experience the truth until we are perfect like him.

       It depends on what sort of knowledge you fill your head with. It's good to disconnect from all the information overload sometimes and work on the self knowledge. Sit in a quiet dark room and breathe kind of thing. Meditate.

       Swim in your own mind. Go through the emotions that come about. It's important to actually feel your emotions as opposed to bottling it all up. Knowing and understanding are two different things. Wisdom is in understanding.

       Wisdom and knowledge are different. Wisdom comes from experience, knowledge from reading or watching. Grief and sorrow differs by the same dynamic.

       Knowledge gained can and in most cases will bring sorrow, after all it is sad to see the direction we as a country are headed, or appear to be heading. However, our sorrow is coming from an anticipation of a negative, but the negative we fear may never come. Fear is future based, I'm not saying you are fearful, but seeing the way the world is headed brings sadness because we are anticipating that the "train" is going to derail, but have no real certainty that it actually will. We need not mourn tomorrow because we know not what lay ahead of us, but live with what we have now. Be elated that the earth is below your feet and you have time to spend doing what ever it is you are doing. 
As far as being saddened by what has taken place, well we cannot change the past so lets not worry about it. Instead let us find a way to fix what has gone wrong. What I am saying is there are 3 times we are dealing with, the past, the present, and future. We have no control of the past, nor do we know where the future will take us, so why not concentrate on the realm we operate in. From this position we can we can plan out our tomorrow and do what we can to change things. Now our mind is concentrated on the joys of now and also the possibility of making a better tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR don't focus on yesterday or tomorrow, but live now and plan ahead

       The path to wisdom must often go through darkness as one grows from ignorance toward knowledge.  Before going into the light, one must often suffer through darkness.  Such is the way of acquisition on this planet.

       Keep this thought in mind when you consider the story of the Garden of Eden. In one sense, it's an origin story. In another sense, it's about what happens as you grow up. And in another sense, it's a warning about what happens whenever you learn something new. The more you know, the more you realize how little you know.

       OP YSK that this passage actually refers to the "burdens of knowledge", basically that you shouldn't seek knowledge (the truth) cause only God is the true knowledge (truth) and thus can't be questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what the elites (ever since biblical times) always wanted: an ignorant mass at their disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: the same applies to the original sin, where God forbade humanity of knowledge in exchange of their blissful ignorance, provided Adam and Eve with all their necessities.

       "You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Everyone is but a breath, even those who seem secure." - Psalm 39:5

       Its mostly very basic and simple stuff after you decode the language into modern English. That's the difficult part. I'm convinced the real reason most immature saps can be convinced the book is the 'word of god' is because of the authoritative sounding old English of doth, thus, hitherto etc. If you're into mysticism or psychedelic experiences then parts of the bible will probably be a lot more interesting. Reading revelations while stoned is a hoot. A lot of the B is garbage, but don't think there isn't some solid stuff in there that is quite beautiful. Plus its at least interesting for the fact of how old it is. Also, if you're reading it in English then apparently a lot of the hidden secrets and truths are rendered obsolete.

       One of my biggest problems is with the New Testament.  It was "translated" so long after it was apparently written that it could have lost it's meaning like the game Telephone.  But the big one is that the chapters which are in it, were decided upon by men of the church.  As a group, they decided which chapters would be the New Testament and just left out others.  Maybe some of those painted a different picture than that of which the church wanted.  I was raised Catholic and, like most kids I suppose who are brought up with religion as a part of their lives, I started to look at things differently and asking questions.  And there were personal experiences with members of the church that just pushed me away and made me pretty much a non believer in a religions interpretation of God.

       A good place to be in. Its nice to know that you can think but horrifying to think of how many aren't able. Not only translation after translation but a funneling effect in Europe as kings would take over and wipe out all other branched off religions. Also, catholics just read the same few passages over and over again year after year. Its clearly just an extension of the governments arm to control the population, and in Texas, it serves as a way to covertly dupe the members into donating to Israel!!(this was on VICE HBO)! I try not to be jaded though because catholicism scares the shit out of me. The churches layouts are identical to the freemasonic tracing board and the Vatican is involved in massive child sex slave trafficking. Painful to imagine a sweaty fat man standing naked over a small boy tied to a bed..

       Yeah, thanks for that image lol.
I have a problem with organized religion in general.  Look at the wars religion has caused.  The deaths.  The regimes and dictators who will do anything for what they believe in or how they interpret their word of god.  But my problem starts at the very beginning of nearly every religious sect that has the same rule: If you don't believe in our god, you're going to hell/will be damned/are infidels etc.  Therefore, everyone is basically doomed by that ideology because there is no one true religion.  But that's just me.  I'm not saying there isn't something "else", but the one I would believe in, wouldn't be pissed if other people didn't believe in that as well.

       I just believe in what I want to believe.  I have completely disassociated myself with Catholicism.  And I'm very peaceful in my beliefs, or non beliefs.  I will never understand how religion sneaks it's way into things where it really shouldn't matter.  I'm Canadian, and I'm always stunned at how religious Republicans have to be to keep their constituencies.  If you want to be elected, God has to be at the forefront of your campaign.  Why?  Why can't an atheist be president?  What's wrong with that?  It should be freedom of religion...or non religion.  It at least falls under freedom of choice.

       Even if the Romans hijacked a counter-culture movement with Jesus, do you not see any truth in His message? Not to mention the evil which runs rampant in this world, the reason we've all met here, looks to be nearing a climax.

        Him calling you
       </a>
       , heed it while you can, the end may be nigh'. I have my doubts too man, but I see no hope, no light in this world without the promise of Christ's return. I'm not catholic, was actually raised Lutheran, but my research has led me to believe that Luther was quite mistaken(or possibly had a darker agenda in mind), when he left the Catholic church. Catholicism has been around for around 2000 years and is supposedly the one, true apostolic church which Christ decreed to Peter.

       You probably knew that stuff though. Sorry if that was a little aggressive or anything, I've just been researching the reformation lately and it's changed my opinions on Catholicism to a more positive light, although they really should let the priests marry, for Christ's sake(literally). Take care.

       It's completely dependent on how the information is presented. People have to have realizations themselves.

       Thanks man, I appreciate it. I find divine truth in the Bible, but I've found that it can be subjective depending on a persons receptiveness. You're right about experience though, most definitely, how can one know light if they've never experienced darkness.
