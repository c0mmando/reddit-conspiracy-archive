<hr/>

<p>If you&#39;re in this sub and reading this post, you likely already are skeptic and have probably come to conclusions about topics most people would find odd or downright &quot;crazy&quot;. Now, if you&#39;re like me, after doing research and realizing how corrupt and upside down things are that are hidden in plain sight, you may feel compelled to try and do something, anything to change this path that we are on. For most of us who are living on meager wages and working 8 hours a day, it&#39;s nearly impossible to do something material to stop corruption, even at the local level. So what can we do? <strong>Educate.</strong></p>

<p>To teach someone something about a topic that is new to them, you must first know the material yourself, which leads me to my first technique:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Know what you&#39;re talking about</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This may seem like common sense, but I am constantly running into people (I was one) that are just starting down the rabbit hole and are missing many pieces to the puzzle that get too excited and start to spew information that can easily be debunked or information that they don&#39;t fully understand and can&#39;t answer any further questions on the matter. Know what you&#39;re talking about or people won&#39;t give you the time of day. That brings me to the next point...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be prepared to stand up to scrutiny</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is why it is crucial to understand your material. &#39;Conspiracy theorist&#39; is already a pejorative term to many people that implies that you lack critical thinking skills and believe anything you hear. It is important to be able to stand your ground and to be able to defend your position regardless of the attacks coming your way. This means avoiding blogspasm on alternative media sites that lack sourcing and gravitating towards primary source documentation. .gov websites are great for sources and are, ironically, the most respected as proof to most debaters on this subject. Knowing every single detail is not necessarily important as I will illustrate later, but having a solid knowledge of your topic will ensure that you will not fall to any internet troll that comes your way.</p>

<p>The first two techniques are pretty self explanatory and pretty instinctual to the majority of people who are &#39;awake&#39;. The next few techniques touch on how to actually make someone aware, and more importantly, <em>engaged</em> in continual research and, likewise, the spreading of awareness to others. </p>

<p>First things first...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Develop a philosophy based on principles</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When I first started researching, I asked myself, &quot;what is the actual definition of government?&quot; At the time, I was in college taking computer and political science classes and would routinely survey my peers and professors as to their definition of what government was. For as many people as I asked, I received that many different answers. Most people were ambiguous and gave answers like &quot;the people&quot; or &quot;people acting on an ideology&quot;. This wasn&#39;t sufficient for me. I went on a journey to understand the <em>nature</em> of government and tried to find a definition that people from any side of the political spectrum could agree with. For me, I found that the most non-controversial and concrete definition I could find was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The government is a monopoly on law and jurisdiction in a certain geographical area</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disregarding the conclusions you may draw from this definition, it is applicable to any type of government anywhere in the world. The fact that, depending on what country you live in, that nation&#39;s government is the only agency in that area who is allowed to establish courts and interpret laws, in my eyes, was undeniable. This led me to ask many other questions and helped put me on track to have a reference point to judge political and economic goings on without having to rely on someone else&#39;s interpretation on the matter. It is up to you to find your own philosophy that you identify with and use that as your foundation to deepen your understanding which will lead to you being more confident in presenting your opinion. Use your own philosophy and principles to help make you more adaptable and malleable in conversations, not to make you rigid and narrow minded in one set belief system or world view. As Bruce Lee once aptly phrased it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHSbMR_udo">be water my friend.</a>. With that in mind, we move on to the next technique:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Humble yourself</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t expect everyone to come to the conclusions that I have or to share the same principles I do. However, I find far too often that people who are trying to present their case on whatever the topic may be come off as extremely hostile and condescending to people that may actually be interested in learning more. Constantly calling people &#39;shills&#39; because they disagree with you gets us no where and further dissuades people from researching these topics on their own. Be prepared to be presented with information you have not come across before and don&#39;t be afraid to admit that you have not seen that bit of information before. It&#39;s a learning experience and doesn&#39;t make you seem so stubborn to others who may be looking to you as a model &#39;rational conspiracy theorist&#39;. However, this does not mean that you cower away from the argument, it merely means that you are open to researching new information because you are confident that your main point is still valid. <strong>Don&#39;t shy away from challenges, embrace them.</strong> </p>

<p>This can lead to a another problem I come across all the time with skeptics and is the next technique brings me to the next point:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid coming to conclusions you cannot conclusively prove</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I find this problem mostly with (but not limited to) 9/11 truth activists. Of all people, conspiracy theorists should know that we simply are not presented with the full truth in almost every instance imaginable. We have to accept that there are closed door meetings, secret emails, anonymous phone calls, insiders trading on privileged information etc. that go on on a daily basis and admit that we simply cannot know the full story on anything. For example, when someone says they <em>know</em> that there were no planes that hit the first two towers, or they <em>know</em> that Cheney was involved (which he most likely was) in the attacks, it opens up the door for people to ask you to present proof, which you can&#39;t. You can explain how Halliburton subsidiary KBR got a no-bid, cost-plus contract to rebuild in Iraq after we destroyed their infrastructure and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children, but the smoking gun link to Cheney being behind 9/11 is still elusive. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Let them do most of the talking. Ask them questions</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but this was (and still is) the hardest method to get used to. I know when I talk to others, I have so many facts and names and dates and everything else running through my head that I have to make a conscious effort to not jump in every 3 seconds. Let them talk become genuinely curious of their opinion of the topic at hand. Speak less and listen more. Become engaged in the conversation and don&#39;t just wait for your turn to talk. Try to ask questions to make them contradict themselves. For example, I was once at a Newt Gingrich rally during the 2012 election cycle and brought signs that said &quot;Newt Gingrich voted [x] times to raise the debt ceiling&quot; and &quot;Newt Gingrich has voted [x] times to have stricter gun laws&quot;. I was quickly screamed at, pushed, called an &#39;Obama supporter&#39; and a litany of other names. I began to gather a crowd around me and decided to field some questions. This is a paraphrased version of how it went down...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Me: You consider yourself conservative, right?</em> </p>

<p><em>Them: Uh...yes?</em></p>

<p><em>Me: So you generally want the government to spend less and for the government to stay out of your lives, right?</em></p>

<p><em>Them: Yes, what&#39;s your point?</em></p>

<p><em>Me: Then why would you support someone who constantly votes for repealing of the debt ceiling which will ultimately lead to higher taxes?
*
*Them: ...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, this particular exchange is just an example on how to exercise the techniques and methods I have laid out so far. The next and last technique is, in my opinion, the most important...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#39;t try to change people&#39;s minds</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This may seem counter-intuitive to everything I have been saying, but in actuality, it is the most useful technique to wake somebody up. My &#39;wake up&#39; moment was when I was a freshman in college and came across the original Zeitgeist film. Today, I can confidently pick apart the film&#39;s inaccuracies but at the time, this new information floored me. I was so intrigued at how clueless I was about things like fiat money and the Federal Reserve that were so intimately intertwined into the very nervous system of society that I had never even heard about before. I began to have an insatiable obsession for discovering the truth. </p>

<p>After a few weeks of research (lol), I thought I knew enough to share my new found wisdom to my friends and family. I would blurt out facts and have barely coherent thoughts from one sentence to the next. Needless to say, those days were a disaster in terms of waking people up. It quickly dawned on me that people are very reluctant to change their minds and that trying to do so simply made people shut down and refuse to continue to engage in a dialog. Those initial interactions forced me to reevaluate my entire approach. I recognized that the only reason I was so passionate about these things was because I had discovered them on my own. I saw that the only way to really make people &#39;wake up&#39; was not by proving my position, but by making them realize that theirs was contradictory and/or not well thought out. As I mentioned before, I tried using leading questions to get them to come face to face with their own logical contradictions, and to my amazement, people became inquisitive and began to research on their own. I would constantly get text messages from friends who, before these conversations, would never spend a second reading or paying attention to news asking me what my take on a certain situation was. Some would even present me with information I had never come across before and were just as excited to share it with me as I was with them. </p>

<p>This should be the goal for us all and we should strive to &#39;pay it forward&#39; and galvanize others to do the same.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Throughout time, the elites have always controlled the flow of information and the narratives by which that information is presented. We are living in an era in which, for the first time ever in human history, the bourgeoisie are able to directly communicate with each other instantaneously, bypassing the gatekeepers of the media and the sultans of spin. The internet is the tool by which an intellectual revolution can be catalyzed and real change can begin. For this to happen though, we need intellectual warriors ready to stand against the status quo and inspire others who will, in turn, embolden others to seek truth.</p>

<p>Use these techniques to recruit others into the fray and constantly strive to refine your own methods of rhetoric to intrigue others. People intuitively know something is wrong with the world but are so overwhelmed by the magnitude of the situation, they don&#39;t even know where to start and thus, never do. Be the person that invigorates them to dive in. </p>

<p>I leave you with a quote by the American revolutionary Samuel Adams which encapsulates my drive and motivation for inspiring others much more eloquently than I ever could:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>It does not take a majority to prevail... but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it is all around building seven.  I was talking with a 50-something co-worker of mine a few weeks ago about Ukraine etc... We came on the topic of 9/11 and I asked him if he had ever seen building 7 fall.  </p>

<p>So we looked it up and watched it.  The only thing I said to him before that is, &quot;Trust your own instincts and be honest with yourself about what you see.&quot;</p>

<p>He watched that at about noon.  When I left around 5, he had his headphones on and his mouth open.  Then in the morning, he came in looking frazzled wearing a crummy black t-shirt.  I told my wife that I thought I sent him through the rabbit hole the night before, so when I saw him the next day, I was sure to ask him if he was doing alright.  It can be quite a shock to the system having to change your worldview so drastically and suddenly.</p>

<p>He then spent the next hour telling me all about everything he learned about 9/11.  He seemed like he had a rough night, but was happy with himself for finding out the truth.  (not that it matters... we aren&#39;t ditch diggers... i&#39;m a chemist and he is a physicist, for context)</p>

<p>edit:  I&#39;ve been giving this a lot of thought lately.  I think one of the difficulties is that people don&#39;t want to consider themselves one of &quot;those conspiracy people&quot;.  The discussion needs to be re-framed from &quot;conspiracy&quot; to &quot;reality&quot;.  People need to ask themselves these questions:</p>

<p>1)  Is it true that governments have used mass deception in the past to manipulate citizens against their best interests?  The answer must necessarily be &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>2)  Is it true that governments continue these practices to this day?  The answer must also necessarily be &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>3)  If these practices continue, then does that make it necessary to investigate and consider these possibilities in order to have a more accurate picture of reality and protect your best interests?  The answer, again, must also necessarily be &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>I think that any rational person will be able to follow this logic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some good points. I think it the &#39;I&#39;m not one of those conspiracy people&#39; aspect is one of the many hurdles faced by newcomers to reality. Shows like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIeTUkWfcLA">MaxResistance</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H7yowrhKuc">AustralianRoundtable</a> make jumping that hurdle so much easier by illustrating just how ridiculous the stereotypes about &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; really are.</p>

<p>If they are anything to go by, &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; are more fun, vibrant and happy than the average shmo on the street. By a long way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Went through much of the same thing you&#39;re talking about here just last week. While sitting at the computer watching a press conference a co-worker came by and started talking to me about the Paris attack, assuming I was watching news about that. I told him I was actually watching a press conference about 28 classified pages dealing with 9/11 that some senators and representatives wanted released (which occurred the day of the Paris attacks). He went on to talk about how he had read the whole 9/11 Commission report and  enjoyed it, saying it &quot;read like an action novel&quot;. I asked him if he was aware that several members of that commission had said that they believed it was a whitewash and that many questions family members had were left untouched. I than asked him if he had ever seen of or heard of Building 7. He said he had not so I showed it to him. Didn&#39;t say anything other than this happened on 9/11 around 5:20pm. It only took him one time of seeing the building collapse and he knew it was an implosion. He said, &quot; That building collapsed into its own footprint, they can only do that in demolitions.&quot; He said he didn&#39;t read anything about WTC 7 in the commission report and I told him he was right and that it was not mentioned once. I told him what the official story was and that they didn&#39;t come out with that until 2008. A few hours went by and I could tell he had been a little shaken by it, he asked me if it was for real what I showed him, or if it had been a hoax. Almost felt bad for him at that point. I told him it was a long way down this rabbit hole if he really wanted to go. Now each time he sees me he wants to know something new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great points, and this is basically my approach to waking people up. The point is not to inundate them with so much obscure and technical information that they are completely overwhelmed but to lead people on a logical track from an axiomatic basis. All that is necessary is to lead people head on to their own contradictions in thought and let them discover the truth on their own. </p>

<p>Let them do most of the talking. Ask them questions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A more powerful technique than most people realize. Nobody knows everything about everything. If you keep on asking questions about any topis, most people will quickly reach the limits of their own knowledge of that topic. Few will then admit this.</p>

<p>Remember, this principle works in both directions. When someone starts questioning <em>you</em>, be careful to avoid the temptation to &quot;keep on going&quot; once you&#39;ve reached your own limit. Better to simply admit that you don&#39;t know the answer than to discredit yourself by making stuff up as you go along.</p>

<p>This might be what Abraham Lincoln was talking about when he once said &quot;It&#39;s better to remain silent and have people wonder if you&#39;re a fool, than to speak up and remove all doubt&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: the technique of questioning even has a name. I think it&#39;s called Platonic rhetoric.</p>

<p>Exactly. In my opinion, the way to approach these topics is to admit from the outset that it is impossible to come to a provable conclusion because of the fact that there is so much information that is not disclosed to the public. The object is to open people up to the possibility that what they think is true is not quite correct so they can examine and isolate the inconsistencies for themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to be honest and it probably won&#39;t be popular.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t talk to anybody about this shit.  I tried explaining some things to my wife years ago and she shut down pretty quick. Every now and then she will ask for my opinion on what is really going on with a news story.  When I explain it to her, she will say something along the lines of &quot;ok, you&#39;re scaring me&quot; and that will end it.  My kids are entering grade school and I watch the indoctrination closely, but you cannot yet explain to a 7 year old what really happened to MLK.  Honestly, I don&#39;t want him trying to explain it to his teacher until he is ready.  </p>

<p>I cring when I take him to cub scouts and see the indoctrination that they use (8 years in the military, I know it when I see it), but he loves going, so...</p>

<p>Co-workers, forget about it.  No politics, religion or world events at work (my rules, not theirs).  </p>

<p>I have my guns, tools, welding gear, generator, etc...  That is how I keep my peace of mind and let my family live their life happily in their ignorance of the world.  </p>

<p>When my boys get older, I will explain the nature of the world to them, show them how to be self sustaining and let them make their own choices about it.  </p>

<p>I exchange ideas online about it, but that is as far as I take it.  I live in a rural place.  If the world burns, I will watch it on youtube.  </p>

<p>You can&#39;t wake up people who worry about clearance sales on shit they don&#39;t need.  Or who quote Bill O&#39;Reilly to you.  Or who laugh about their favorite sitcoms. (&quot;OMG, did you see Friends&quot;...  I know it&#39;s off the air, but I haven&#39;t watched T.V. In years, so give me a break)</p>

<p>Think small.  Think family, neighborhood, community.  Stick a couple of extra cans of gas in your shed and stick back a can of peaches every now and then.  Let your people know every day that you love them while keeping your eye on the horizon.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think something that&#39;s important that I&#39;ve learned is talking to people differently. Just being more friendly and thoughtful works pretty well. This works in person and on the internet. People can sense that vibe. I&#39;ve also noticed it can become contagious. The paid content manipulators have a harder time baiting you into something as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to spend a fair amount of time trying to &quot;wake people up&quot;, much of it online. I called it &quot;disrupting their reality&quot;. </p>

<p>I found that the vast majority of people are too afraid, or have a vested interest in staying asleep. So their response is often to attack you. Perhaps my approach was a little too aggressive, but I did not feel that this was productive, for the most part.</p>

<p>Additionally, when we talk about a lot of the conspiracy theories, I couldn&#39;t find a good way to translate knowledge of the &quot;Truth&quot; into action that would improve the lives of individuals. OK, building 7 didn&#39;t fall as a result of planes flying into it or fire, it was blown up. Let&#39;s say we accept that a group of Saudi&#39;s flew planes into the towers, and that the govt knew in advance and had a chance to stop it, but chose not to. So what? How does knowing this allow me to improve my life? It gets me on the path to understanding that the govt is not my friend, and so perhaps I will make different or more informed choices, but I can&#39;t draw a simple and direct line between this knowledge, and a happier/wealthier/improved life.</p>

<p>So I focus on disrupting my own reality, and working with people who have similar ideas. This is much more productive; we can accomplish much more together and learn from each other through cooperation so much more than a discussion that degenerates into argument, and from argument into personal attack.</p>

<p>When I choose to focus on waking people up, instead I do it like this:</p>

<p>I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Vehicle insurance is insanely high. For a young man to insure a piece of shit car, they will be paying $3,000 Cdn yearly or higher starting out. When we add up gas, maintenance, parking in downtown Toronto ($200/month to rent a spot in the core), winter tires, and paying for the actual vehicle we find that we rapidly approach a figure close to $10k/year, if we want something halfway decent and reliable to get to work with.</p>

<p>Instead, my wife and I decided to live in a cheap dump on the transit line, and save that money for a rental property. It took us 5 long years to save some money, and in that time the real estate values in our target neighbourhood literally doubled. We had a very specific dream, though, so we buckled down and saved for another 3 years. In 8 years, we had saved about $100k, the money we would have spent on a car plus a little. We put that as a downpayment on a 500k property, on the subway line, split into 3 units. We live in one, and the renters pay the mortgage plus some of the utilities. As the rent increases, we accelerate our mortgage payments, and we pay maintenance, property tax, and the rest of the utilities which still works out to around the same we would pay for rent, some years less, some years a little more. We have owned that property for 7 years now, and put maybe another $200k into slowly gutting it in tiny chunks and rebuilding it from the inside out, and developing it: upgrading from a rented electric water tank to a gas tankless system, rebuilding the furnace/boiler, upgrading the electrical, adding a room, etc. In that 7 years it has more than doubled in value and is worth more than $1 million Cdn, and the renters have paid close to $200k into it. If we sold it today we would probably walk away with around $750k.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we had bought a car all those years ago, our net worth increase today would be exactly: one shitty car.</p>

<p>My angle here is this: I think that the reliance on the automobile is a root cause of poverty in North America. Everything about the media and advertising says the opposite: if you have a nice car, you are rich and successful, but it&#39;s totally a lie. I think that this way of thinking is causing generations of poverty and destroying the environment. I have made specific life choices to live, work and play in a decent city with transit options, and that has given me wealth and options that I do not think I would be likely to find any other way.</p>

<p>From time to time, this simple story makes a young person start asking questions. I even get the occasional message: &quot;Wow! I&#39;m fascinated by your idea that simple life choices can make you rich!&quot;</p>

<p>This approach, I think, shows people a simple and direct path that anybody can take towards building a better future both for themselves, their family, and the planet. It is not a simple and convenient choice; it is a hard choice for many people. But anyone can do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The globalists have been creating anticipation in Canadians for a coming housing correction. I believe the favourite MSM CBC phase is 30% over valued, though I believe the next correction to be that of American 2008 proportions. If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned from spying globalist conferences and publications, its that they try to slay the rent seeking elite from time to time, and doubly they use this as a means to wealth transfer from the old to the young where in the savages live their lives based solely on their survivalist need to accumulate wealth and materialist garbage. If we observe the explosion in condo/high density living spaces being dumped into Toronto, we can see that the city is being engineered to hold more people, also the carnival that was Ford also imposed more transit lines despite objections by the cities bourgeoisie plutocrats. Ford also helped with his clown show to divert attention away from this obvious engineering of the city which has been quite remarkable ever since the American housing deflation of 2008, though that in itself is tied to other globalist reforms taking place. </p>

<p>With regards to waking people, I wouldn&#39;t bother as well. People are animals, they follow the herd, they don&#39;t question the perceptual box they put themselves in and see out of. The bankers are moving towards governance now that the system is transitioning to SDRs instead of USD as the primary global currency reserve, which means let the bankers take care of things with their reforms, because people do not want or care for responsibility unless it affects their own individual financial situation and that&#39;s only if they&#39;re capable of understanding it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know when the bubble will pop, but you should definitely look into it more since you have considerably more assets invested into real estate. Look into the issue of Rent Seeking in particular, I&#39;ve heard the globalist economic school Standford, or SCID, their think tank/globalist economic institution mention this often with regards to India and China as a serious issue in regards to creating and expanding the middle classes in those countries. In fact I think I&#39;ll dig a little more into this when I have time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not have time at this moment to give your comment the considered reply that it deserves, but: 
I expected the pop in Canada years ago; the artificially low interest rates made cheap money available; although this happened after the pop in the US it came just in time to prevent a pop here. I do think real estate is over valued. My plan would be to buy more if/when a sale occurs.</p>

<p>where wealth accumulates there will always be multiple forces attempting to take a bite. </p>

<p>Location matters in real estate. In Canada, people tend to go back to school when times get tough, and so my strategy is to buy within walking distance of a major university, on the subway line. This hedges against increases in oil price as well as puts a floor under real estate when the bubbles pop. </p>

<p>I am not a fan of badly built condos; but I like high density as I think it&#39;s much more economically and environmentally feasible/sustainable than suburbia. If I was a city planner I would try to encourage buildings in a range of 4-8 stories built to encourage walkable neighbourhoods, optimized for transit not cars. I think the bad build quality of many condo buildings will result in slums; we need affordable housing but I think this is a bad path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a problem, I understand those time constraints painfully myself, exploration of globalism is unfortunately a side hobby due in part by work constraints amongst other things. With regards to the Canadian housing bubble not popping, that was due to our government holding onto the Canadian banking mortgages, meaning a massive 100+ billion dollar bail out to keep the banks solvent and pumping liquidity into the market. </p>

<p>You&#39;re quite clever in regards to your selection of housing, I would also agree such a strategy would help to minimize risk in another housing correction. I also agree with comments on high density living spaces, though I wonder if they&#39;re really that poorly built? The CBC ran Condo Zone a few years ago as a way to warn Canadians against real estate investment, as with all globalist propaganda I&#39;m left wondering what&#39;s the thread of truth woven into their narratives. Regardless quality high density living spaces would help immensely with city state planning, as well I hope those condos don&#39;t become the slums you&#39;ve aforementioned, that&#39;s also propagated by the CDC documentary so I feel left wondering. </p>

<p>Anyway lots to ponder, so little time to investigate... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can relate to this post a lot and I want to add something that I&#39;ve learned over the last decade.  There are certain people and situations that you need to leave alone.  I&#39;ve had the same argument with the same handful of friends dozens of times.  No matter how many facts you use and thought provoking insight, it just turns into a circle jerk.  These people are usually the types that are already &quot;know it all&quot;.  I&#39;ve found it&#39;s much more productive to spend time on open minded, like-minded individuals.  Try to speak and discuss these topics with people who are willing to listen and have a civil conversation with.  They might not agree but in due time their sense of reason will overcome.  </p>

<p>I only talk to people who want to listen and discuss these issues with me.  I never overstate my opinions at work, family gatherings, or social events.  Even when certain people ask my take on something ill usually play ignorance unless I&#39;m confident that my thoughts will be well received.  </p>

<p>TLDR; Its useless to try and inform people that are pridefully ignorant.  It&#39;s healthier to be selective with whom you try to &quot;enlighten&quot;.</p>

<p>Saying something as a one-off joke gets a lot more attention and thought than if you go on a long rant. If you start to rant (unless they&#39;re already on your side), people go &quot;oh he&#39;s mad&quot; and ignore what you say, I&#39;ve found. </p>

<p>Jokes and off-the-cuff remarks are the way to go. Best way to plant the seed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are retarded animals, do not make intelligent over assumptions because people will outright fail them. People create their own perceptual boxes and they entrap themselves within with little to no open mind for things outside of it.</p>

<p>That said the only way to make people conscious of the problem is to underlay the base concepts of the said problem and to illustrate in the oratory or literary way to convey those concepts. The bigger problem is that the MSM social programming has incredible psychological effectiveness, this is reinforced with the herd mentality which is especially evidenced here on reddit(&quot;hive mind&quot;) which causes people to self police the ideas and expressions of others. r/conspiracy is not safe from this programming methodology either, most of conspiracy is false, a concocted delusion with fragments of reality to dilute information about the true goals and aspirations of the bankers. Some obvious examples, aliens, FEMA death camps, the &quot;police state&quot;(we are individually that state), Jewish conspiracy which is utterly a joke and one that runs parallel with white supremacist philosophies regarding blame for globalization. There are other things with regards to accuracy, particularly vaccines as those are just shitty drugs, some effective, some not at all with the intent to simply reinforce globalist narratives and the need for some sort of world health organization, ie, WHO, this is the creation of paradigms which fall into globalist narratives and prime the public for aspects of global governance. </p>

<p>Considering now that I&#39;ve been digging through globalist publications, conferences belonging to their think tanks or ivy league schools, I actually support the notion of world government, what they&#39;ve done regardless of the inane evil of the thing is the far lesser then the savageness of the local evils our tribal, plutocratic leaders bring upon us, evils we reflect into them through the individual. The micro is the macro, shitty individuals make shitty societies and the bankers through the internet and through the externalization of technology have been policing and modifying the primitive behavioral animals within us, bringing us an unprecedented amount of socio-economic development. Not only are the bankers taking us technologically into the future they as also destroying the disparities created by their own past conquest of the planet, returning the wealth stolen and hidden in the west and redistributing it back into the world pre-banker-British imperialism(the first world empire/transition).</p>

<p>If it matters at all let the retards be at peace, the plebeian masses care nothing for intelligence, philosophy or understanding the why of things. Be at peace being an explorer then being the fool trying to wake the dead. </p>

<p>As well if you want a good explanation of the base economics of the bankers system, I found this blogger who discusses the economic system used to transition us to world government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with globally centralized government is much the same as the problem with governments in general: it creates a focal point for power. Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. We know this to be true. Therefor, a global government will result in the most corrupt and powerful organization the world has ever seen in the history of mankind; all of it built on good intentions, and sold to the people by silver-tongued politicians. I would much prefer the following:</p>

<p>Untie the idea of nation from geography. A nation of people is now defined as: a group of people united by their beliefs around how they should be governed. A new nation can be created at any time. Laws are open source style, and voted upon by citizens directly instead of elected representatives; elected representatives must represent the will of the people according to the laws the citizens vote in. It is possible to form nations within nations; and nations across nations. This is now a global nation; people around the globe can communicate and spontaneously form new nations with new laws independant of physical location. All that is required to form a new nation is: the people declare that they have formed a new nation. We can have nations formed of single individuals.</p>

<p>Decentralization; power to the people. That is a future I can get behind,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Decentralization is a wild fantasy, an ignorance of the socio-economic system which we externalize to create social order within our tribal groups. Decentralization as it was in the past has always, always been marred by long periods of warfare for resources, people and economic control, or simply put, centralization. Humans are biologically wired for consolidation, our survivalist instinct is responsible for this, the hoarding of materialist resources in large part for greater social status and or survival. This hoarding of power takes shape in the form of the economic system, previously rent seeking was the preferable means of maintaining wealth, it still is. The rulers of old owned the land of their surfs, and prior to the bankers subversion of the Roman Catholic Emperor in the European states prior to the late 1600s, many were surfs. That is the pattern of decentralized human power structures in human history. Centralization on the other hand is normally marked by great periods of economic, cultural and most importantly technological advancement. </p>

<p>The human individual is totally irresponsible, an animal whose primitive survivalist instincts indulge only things pertaining to a singular accumulation of resources which are only dispersed strategically. The bankers on the other hand have created more fiat currency(money, a byproduct of human time and effort) then there is in the present, by taking it from the future. This economic system completely bypasses the singular, linear concept of human economic systems and allows for mass economic development on a scale not seen before. Individuals cannot create such structures, cannot create the throughput for economic stability, cannot parse the law and cannot socially program society without specialized institutions under centralized bodies. Also the idea that the law is in anyway an effective means to police the plutocrats is false, plutocrats and plebeians are the same, they have the same baseline social programming and primitive desires, they both act savagely to their own ends. Human systems operate between the connections of individuals in concentrated groupings, the law is simply that in name if those who administrate it are not held to it by their association of connections in a centralized power structure. Remember as well decentralized structures are not even that, their severely fragmented forms of power with the inability to effect mass reforms without great consequence, time and innate human corruption.</p>

<p>A nation is a psychological device, a means to externalize others as a means of competition for resources, us vs the enemy mentality which has been used abundantly and recently by American plutocrats as a means to prime the U.S. public for invasions of resource rich nations ahead of the SDR swap in of USDs. The bankers/globalist are eradicating these borders slowly, those between individuals through the creation of global trade, which facilitates the trade of thought, ideas and the eradication of borders between human individuals. </p>

<p>Let us not forget the globalized world is what the bankers are working for, the technology to get us there was also of their making and the shifts in paradigms and social programming was also of their doing too. It took a highly concentrated economic system with the right amount of power levers to make any of the present possible. If the bankers didn&#39;t wipe the slate clean with WWI-II we would still be living in a highly fractured world.</p>

<p>I also agree that power corrupts, that is a never ending problem and one the bankers have been attempting to resolve through the externalization of our human deficiencies in technology, trans humanism, or maybe even artificial intelligence. Individuals however have no stake in correcting such a problem with such a system, not without the personalized motivation knowing plutocratic corruption could affect them. TED talk below I think gives a sliver of insight into the globalist ideology of technology with regards to policing local/national plutocratic behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern Americans admire figures like Buzz Lightyear, Jean Luc Picard, Buzz Aldrin. Its that image from their favorite tv shows of heroic captains standing up for what&#39;s right, having to mutiny from time to time and being able to assemble in a team of Avengers to save the day. Every American for the past two or three generations can quickly morph into a comic book superhero. Because deep-down they&#39;ll have to come to a heart-to-heart with themselves.</p>

<p>End the Fed &amp; the IRS and good riddance, the American people should have greater currency options or even work together with their own currency. The creation of the Federal Reserve Bank was a coup of the government by the mafia and is of no value to a Space Age civilization governed by a True Congress of Representatives. </p>

<p>A system like Bitcoin would be greatly superior in helping everyone achieve their full potential. But hey, if you want to stay with paper money, I&#39;m sure there are numerous printing firms we could use. Check this out, you could easily trade in money that looks like baseball cards. I hear there is a Honus Wagner baseball card out there worth 2.1 million $$$. Now, I&#39;d really like for you to stop and think about this for a moment. The Federal Reserve doesn&#39;t do anything that any printing company can&#39;t do. Sports Cards, Comic books. People who can make you believe that that Honus Wagner baseball card is worth 2.1mil $$$ or that a Ken Griffey Jr. card is worth $100. The job of the Federal Reserve isn&#39;t rocket science and I say it might just as well be comicbook writer Stan Lee. Anyone that has ever picked up a pricing guide for baseball cards, comic books, and coins should quickly be able to realize the job of the Federal Reserve Bank or the Treasury.</p>

<p>If you stand firm and don&#39;t compromise than the only acceptable President would be some bold NASA Administrator willing to stand up in a Presidential debate against slimy politicians. Perhaps a US Space Force Commander dedicated to get our nation to those worlds around other stars? I&#39;d have to say Rand Paul is the closest candidate there is to it because the best way to get to Type I &amp; Type II Civilization would be to stop giving the Federal Reserve gangster thugs a monopoly on currency provisioning for the Congress. Not to mention they are suspects in what should be a thorough investigation in to the Kennedy assassination.  I&#39;d be just as happy trading in baseball cards. The Founders were visionaries ahead of their time and produced a Constitution that reserved that power to the Congress and we can contract out the job to Upperdeck or Marvel or DC or some card &amp; comic pricing guide company. I think we can all agree  that there are much better ways to trade that we could come up with together in Congress and the people in charge of the Federal Reserve have proven time &amp; again that they in fact haven&#39;t been a very good investment for the people of the United States of America. If we owe anyone anything its a fully employed Space Age Planet Earth. </p>

<p>In conclusuion: 
Super Awesome Team of Space Cadets</p>

<li>Far and above everything else would be our hidden history. We are lead to believe that life on Earth originated by chance in a swamp, that we evolved into monkeys and then into humans. In reality, the truth is far more complex and interesting. This lie was created by  33rd degree Mason (Darwin&#39;s father) and implants into our subconscious that we are more evolved than those &#39;slave whippers&#39; back in Egypt. </li>
</ol>

<p>Not only that, but if people realized how powerful their mind really is and how they can consciously create their own reality, there would be no more conspiracies.</p>

<p>If 7200 monks meditating together is able to lower global terrorism by over 70% , think about what we could do with 100,000 people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely a start in the right direction. Not eccentric at all. Watch their videos they have on youtube. I&#39;d say that everything they say is more or less possible, just not always correct. </p>

<p>As for how life on this planet originated, google &quot;Panspermia&quot;. It&#39;s been admitted as possible by all the big names of science, but the only thing keeping it from being possible (&quot;apparently&quot;) is the radiation belt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well let me put things into context. 99.9999% of all space dust is freeze dried bacteria. The notion that bacteria is hard to come by is absoutely absurd. It finds its ways to grow in completely sterilized water. Panspermia is the idea, and reality really, that some of the bacteria that is floating around in space made it here to Earth. Carl Sagan said that, while promising, Panspermia couldn&#39;t be true because the radiation belt would kill the bacteria on its way to Earth.</p>

<p>So he did a few calculations and with a flick of a pen, totally disregarded any possible outside factors that may have been able to bring some of this bacteria to Earth. Perhaps some electric whirlwinds that connect the sun and planets, which are visible in many pictures and videos of NASA, might be able to carry these bacteria. Or, perhaps a more advanced race from another planet or galaxy could have seeded some of this bacteria on our planet. </p>

<p>Our human DNA was not an accident. By putting DNA in a test tube and sterilized water in another tube next to it, and then running 7hz through the sterilized water, the water molecules rearranged into DNA. This was done by a Nobel Prize laureate... It suggests that DNA can spontaneously arise out of the background vibrations of the universe... </p>
