<blockquote>
<p>Suppose a reporter interviewed players behind the scenes re the question: who really runs the US government? Who really sets national policy?</p>

<p>A legit interview. Actual people. Actual quotes. Not just a circumstantial case.</p>

<p>And suppose these players answered the big questions directly and unmistakably?</p>

<p>And then…nothing happened.</p>

<p>No further coverage. No media hounds let loose to dig further. No government investigation. Nothing.</p>

<p>Well, it’s true. There was an interview. The questions were asked and answered. There was no tap-dancing or beating around the bush or vague reference.</p>

<p>Anyone who was anyone in Washington politics or media had access to the interview. Understood its meaning.</p>

<p>But no one shouted from the rooftops. No one used the conversation to force a scandal. No one protested loudly.</p>

<p>The conversation revealed that the entire basis of the Constitution had been torpedoed, that the people who were running US national policy were agents of an elite shadow group.</p>

<p>And yet: official silence. Media silence. The Dept. of Justice made no moves, Congress undertook no serious inquiries, and the President, Jimmy Carter, issued no statements. Carter was himself a covert agent in the White House, a willing pawn, and despite his proclaimed religious values, was nothing more than a rank con artist, a hustler, a phony down to his fingertips.</p>

<p>I’ll boil down the 1978 conversation between a reporter and two Trilateral Commission members:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“The US has been taken over.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so?”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way, the infamous Trilateral Commission still exists.</p>

<p>Many people think the TC, created in 1973 by David Rockefeller, is a relic of an older time. Think again.</p>

<p>Patrick Wood, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H4GPJO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000H4GPJO">Trilaterals Over Washington,</a> points out there are only 87 members of the Trilateral Commission who live in America. Obama appointed eleven of them to posts in his administration.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary;</p></li>
<li><p>James Jones, National Security Advisor;</p></li>
<li><p>Paul Volker, Chairman, Economic Recovery Committee;</p></li>
<li><p>Dennis Blair, Director of National Intelligence.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Several other noteworthy Trilateral members: George HW Bush; Bill Clinton; Dick Cheney; Al Gore.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the original stated goal of the TC was to create “a new international economic order.”</p>

<p>In the run-up to his inauguration after the 2008 presidential election, Obama was tutored by the co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, Zbigniew Brzezinski.</p>

<p>Brzezinski wrote, four years before birthing the TC with his godfather, David Rockefeller:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“[The] nation state as a fundamental unit of man’s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force. International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any doubt on the question of TC goals is answered by David Rockefeller himself, the founder of the TC, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-David-Rockefeller/dp/0812969731">in his Memoirs</a> (2003):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay. Here is a close-up snap shot of a remarkable moment from out of the past. It’s through-the-looking-glass—a conversation between reporter, Jeremiah Novak, and two Trilateral Commission members, Karl Kaiser and Richard Cooper. The interview took place in 1978. It concerned the issue of exactly who was formulating US economic and political policy.</p>

<p>The careless and off-hand attitude of Trilateralists Kaiser and Cooper is astonishing. It’s as if they’re saying, “What we’re revealing is already out in the open, it’s too late to do anything about it, why are you so worked up, we’ve already won…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOVAK (the reporter): Is it true that a private [Trilateral committee] led by Henry Owen of the US and made up of [Trilateral] representatives of the US, UK, West Germany, Japan, France and the EEC is coordinating the economic and political policies of the Trilateral countries [which would include the US]?</p>

<p>COOPER: Yes, they have met three times.</p>

<p>NOVAK: Yet, in your recent paper you state that this committee should remain informal because to formalize ‘this function might well prove offensive to some of the Trilateral and other countries which do not take part.’ Who are you afraid of?</p>

<p>KAISER: Many countries in Europe would resent the dominant role that West Germany plays at these [Trilateral] meetings.</p>

<p>COOPER: Many people still live in a world of separate nations, and they would resent such coordination [of policy].</p>

<p>NOVAK: But this [Trilateral] committee is essential to your whole policy. How can you keep it a secret or fail to try to get popular support [for its decisions on how Trilateral member nations will conduct their economic and political policies]?</p>

<p>COOPER: Well, I guess it’s the press’ job to publicize it.</p>

<p>NOVAK: Yes, but why doesn’t President Carter come out with it and tell the American people that [US] economic and political power is being coordinated by a [Trilateral] committee made up of Henry Owen and six others? After all, if [US] policy is being made on a multinational level, the people should know.</p>

<p>COOPER: President Carter and Secretary of State Vance have constantly alluded to this in their speeches. [untrue]</p>

<p>KAISER: It just hasn’t become an issue.</p>

South End Press, Boston. Pages 192-3.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This interview “slipped under the mainstream media radar,” which is to say, it was ignored, buried, sat on, censored.</p>

<p>US economic and political policy run by a committee of the Trilateral Commission—the Commission had been created in 1973 as an “informal discussion group” by David Rockefeller and his sidekick, Zbigniew Brzezinski.</p>

<p>When Carter won the presidential election, his aide, Hamilton Jordan, said that if after the inauguration, Cy Vance and Brzezinski came on board as secretary of state and national security adviser, “We’ve lost. And I’ll quit.” Lost—because both men were powerful members of the Trilateral Commission and their appointment to key positions would signal a surrender of White House control to the Commission.</p>

<p>Vance and Brzezinski were appointed secretary of state and national security adviser, as Jordan feared. But he didn’t quit. He became Carter’s chief of staff.</p>

<p>Think about this: if the interview had gained exposure, if it had ignited a firestorm in the press, with reporters pouring gasoline on it day in and day out, for months, interviewing Trilateral players and their government allies and their banking allies and their mega-corporate allies and their shills…with rats coming out of the closet and confessing exactly how the US government had been taken over…</p>

<p>…with headlines like:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SECRETIVE GROUP RUNS US NATIONAL POLICY;</p>

<p>US GOVERNMENT HELD PRISONER BY TRILATERAL COMMISSION;</p>

<p>AMERICA RUN BY ROCKEFELLER;</p>

<p>THE MEN BEHIND THE CURTAIN: DESTROYING INDEPENDENT AMERICA…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On and on and on…</p>

<p>This would have created the seeds of an alternative future, a future quite unlike the present we are living through now.</p>

<p>Of course, the naysayers would say it’s futile to imagine a future that didn’t happen, and we should just lay down and forget and let the takeover proceed. Yes, they always say that. </p>

<p>They always say there is no chance for victory, because they’ve given up on their own lives, they’ve made their own internal compromises, they’ve sold themselves out over and over, they’ve bargained away their last chip of power and imagination, and they want companions in their spiritual narcosis.</p>

<p>But there it is. The interview that “never happened.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about portraying the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateral_Commission">Trilateral Commission</a> some secretive, clandestine alien/Illuminati/satanic cabal is that it detracts from more reasoned discussions about whether a group of non-elected rich power brokers should determine global economic policies. The fact of the matter is that the group has never been particularly secret. Going back to the &#39;70s most public libraries had material on TC and CFR and IMF. All have websites and published minutes. Here&#39;s the <a href="http://trilateral.org/go.cfm?do=Page.View&amp;amp;pid=9">Trilateral Commission FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>The real q is not whether they are secretive, but rather whether the goals of the likes of Zbigniew Brzezinski, Tom Foley, Dick Cheney, Goldman Sachs, BP, Citicorp et al are compatible with freedom, liberty, happiness and humanity. The TC makes does not hide its goal of globalization through capitalization.</p>

<p>Its notable that they receive criticism from both the right and the left, literally from the John Birch Society to Noam Chomsky. Are they evil? Yeah, probably. Are they secretive about their conspiracy to alter the balances of power and the global economy? Not so much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>rule one of secret society, hide in plain sight. its easier to deflect or omit things than it is to hide them completely.</p>

<p>let the people know just enough to avoid suspicion and no one really bothers to dig. its a lot easier to hide things when no one is looking for them. after so many leaks and scandals people have been starting to look in to them on their own.</p>

<p>are they evil? of course they are, its a bunch of rich men sitting in their ivory towers doing everything they can to build them higher and protect them. they are doing this at the expense of the rest of us. 
do you really think the nice guy is the one running a mega corporation or bombing other countries?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  I would also add that a very high percentage of members in some groups (CFR, Freemasons for example) do not know the real purpose/aspirations of the group(which makes it WAY easier to hide your true agenda).  The CFR is really made up of a council of <strong>very few</strong> people who make decisions, and know/reap the true benefits.  The &quot;majority&quot; of the CFR are just &quot;semi&quot; rich, and famous people who join because of the prestige, social, and networking opportunities offered.  The &quot;globalist&quot; agenda is wrapped in philanthropy, and good intentions, and this makes the people in the CFR think they are secretly helping the world(but the poor are too ignorant to know the CFR is helping them).  This combination of making members feel important, and helpful makes them help the CFR do things that might seem like you would need to be evil to do.  They feel like a doctor giving an baby a shot.  The baby is ignorant, and thinks the doctor is trying to hurt him.  Even though the baby will cry, and might even try to stop the doctor from giving him the shot, the doctor must give him the shot anyway, because he knows better than the infant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely.  <strong>If done the right way.</strong>  Right now it is being done secretly, without public discussion.  It is being done illegally.  I do not trust the people who are pushing for it(the same people who will also be running this one world gov&#39;t) because they have proven that they are willing to do whatever it takes to keep their power.  We are not yet morally and spiritually capable for the benefits to outweigh the risks in having a one world government.  If corruption(or any force that threatens the human race) ever takes hold in one world government, there is no other power to &quot;check&quot; it, so the corruption could conceivably persist forever, with no way of stopping it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likely more misguided than evil.  Though you probably do have to put a value on human life (in the short term) to pursue some of the policies of these sorts of globalists.</p>

<p>Realistically, Atlantacysts who have adopted the east west paradigm into military and economic strategy, are a continuation of colonialism and great game politics of the british empire, a continuation of the autriohungarian and even roman empires.  Chatham House isn&#39;t just the &quot;sister&quot; of the CFR.  Roundtables are still managed through europe.</p>

<p>The argument is that the asiatic influence on eastern europe and the world island would lead to totalitarian world order, whereas they believe that western authorotarianism is justifiable on the road to a more socialist world system.  Colonial domination of resources is rationalized by some sort of mandate of heaven and belief that &quot;our way is for the best&quot; even if we lie cheat, steal and murder to get there.</p>

<p>maybe they&#39;re right, but it&#39;s a twisted game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the term Atlanticism. It will be interesting to see how well NATO bonds hold up in the face of Europe&#39;s energy needs. OPEC is bringing US energy independence to heel, and Russia could entice much of Europe to look to the East.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very astute comment! I have seen a recurring trend among those prominent in round tables. The words &quot;new world order&quot; are always wrapped in the idealism of world peace. Too often these players are characterized as evil men sitting around a table, plotting evil deeds while playing with their evil mustaches. As far as I can tell they think what they are doing is moral and a necessity. I wonder how many of us would change our tunes if we belonged to this class. </p>
