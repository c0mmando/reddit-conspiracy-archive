       “Terrorism thus has been known to provide a means of social control.

       Going to cut and paste my "How they did it." post about this as additional information for yours:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2s62bh/still_think_the_paris_attacks_werent_an_operation/">

      <p>
       With most of the media taking the pre-packaged story of "radical muslim terrorists" having perpetrated the attacks in Paris, many others have claimed from a very early time that this was an "operation". The most difficult thing for people to believe is how this could have been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put yourself in the role of an "intelligence director" who wanted to influence a population against "muslim terrorists" for political reasons. How would you do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The first thing you do is find your patsies. You are going to have pre-existing connections to the more radical nutballs that you would find in any community. Your agents earn credibility from them by being able to acquire illegal weapons and show lots of money. Perhaps at some point, when there is an operation in another country, they say to their "asset" they are radicalizing "Watch. There will be an attack by X person in Y country." Then, when it happens, they believe that you are tied in with a greater network of Islamic "radicals" all over the world.

       I have heard it said before that there isn't a "radical islamic" group that the Mossad hasn't infiltrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://new.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-Mossad-spy-that-infiltrated-Hezbollah-was-in-charge-of-Nasrallahs-security-384914%5B3%5D">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even former Mossad agent, Victor Ostrovsky, wrote about using radicals to their advantage.
       <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/conspiracy/wtcbomb3.txt%5B4%5D">
        http://www.textfiles.com/conspiracy/wtcbomb3.txt[4]
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Having prepared public opinion and having already infiltrated the radical mosques in New Jersey and Brooklyn where Abdel Rahman preached and disciples like El Sayyid Nosair prayed, Mossad, says Ostrovsky, almost certainly recruited a close associate of the rabble-rousing Egyptian blind man.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       After you have the assets you have radicalized ready to go, then you tell them a very simple story: "The signal will be tomorrow. There will be an attack in Paris. The following day at XX time, there will be a coordinated attack by people like us all over the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, when the attack happens, your new patsies (or assets) will see this as even more legitimate and carry out the plan. Whether it was legitimate wetwork or staged doesn't really matter. What matters is the result: People are roused to fight against "islamic terrorists" and your patsies believe that it really happened for the reasons you explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, you leave your patsies hanging out to dry. Do not give them a chance to surrender and make sure that they are killed. This way, they are unable to tell the story of who convinced them to do this. With them being dead, now you control every part of their story and can overwhelm any dissent from that story with your powerful connections in the media. The politicians come out to parrot your "official story".
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were a person that did that sort of thing, that's how I would do it. This leaves me with the question: Maybe people are actually relatively peaceful? What if we all actually get along, but psychopaths in government are the source of conflict more than a force for peace in the world?

      <p>
       That was a GREAT post...and smack-dab right on too.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a relative of a Lieutenant seaman on the USS Liberty (whom I never met) who was killed by the Israelis (he actually died 3 days after they attacked this vessel that they knew was American in international waters) I am VERY familiar with Israeli deviousness and their little "false flag formula" that they keep digging out and throwing in our faces. This is the "new and improved" post-9/11 formula though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The formula is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       *Israel pulls a false-flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       *They try to garner sympathy with the "oh us poor Jews!"...again. (and again, and again, and again, ad infinitum...citing an event that is over 70 years old and has precious little corroborating evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       *They try to get EVERYONE to hate Muslims, especially Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Christians will eventually start slaughtering Muslims (happening right now) because they have no idea that the Jewish religion teaches us Jews that Christians are stupid and are only fit for the "use" of us Jews as cannon fodder. No Jews are in the fight though. The ethnic cleansing has begun a LONG time ago and America is just as complicit as Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Americans fall for yet another bullshit story (like the Liberty coverup, the Lavon affair, the USS Cole bombing, 9/11...the list goes on and on and on.)
      </p>
      <p>
       *I$rael profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've seen this same damn situation play out again and again and again and NOBODY questions it??
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't the IDF deal with their little "Muslim problem?" Why must they have their "bestest friend" the US (that's also a laugh) come to their aid while NO Jews die?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the reasons...probably the BIGGEST reason...why Israel has to go. Well, not "has to go" but has to be self-sufficient. If they want to start wars over their little "global domination" plan they'd better do it themselves...because American servicemen HAVE caught on and they are sick and tired fighting for Israels' appeasement (and out-and-out lies). Their entire economy is propped up by the US and all they do is steal our weapons and computer technology, copy it, and sell it to the highest bidder--or use it against Palestinians in the Gaza Concentration Camp--which makes the Third Reich after the war look like Disneyworld. Not to mention the cyber-terrorism (Stuxnet) that very likely was the cause of the Japanese nuclear crisis...along with a "micro-nuke" that was put into the Fukushima plant by an Israeli "security" company (what an oxymoron!) and detonated because Japan was enriching uranium for Iran. Now France's warning from Nuttyahoo to France about recognizing Palestine as a state ("a grave mistake") has come true...what a surprise! UNFUELED NUKE PLANTS DO NOT, AND CANNOT--EVER--EXPLODE. Source: Jim Stone, ex-nuclear engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's time for the US to cut Israel loose. They are a rouge criminal terrorist state. The TEN MILLION dollars per day that we loan Israel (and have NEVER been paid back one red cent of these "loans") can be much better spent here at home feeding the 62.7% of Americans out of work and giving them jobs...not supporting the cushy lives Jewish "settlers" (land thieves) lead with FREE healthcare and a massive social welfare system (unavailable to Israeli Arabs due to racism)...all courtesy of YOU...the United States taxpayer. The fact that America supports a country that commits serious war crimes on a
       <strong>
        daily
       </strong>
       basis is well known throughout the world...they don't "hate us for our freedom"--another Bush/Zionist media LIE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews like me have known this for a LONG time (I'm old) but the new generations coming up have no connections to Israel or "the holocaust" and are as disgusted about Israel's human rights violations as I am.

       Plenty. For one the shooting at the Chris brown concert was "real". Plenty of things happen, but when things grab ahold of the media and force down the throats of everyone, it's fair to be skeptical of the story they so desperately want us to believe and support.

      <p>
       CNN were on the spot since, you know, a terrorist attack happened the day before and they were on assignment. How does this prove anything?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The videos and details of the Paris shooting do not add up,[6] as the videos contain numerous discrepancies worth considering, such as no blood or recoil, while Couliabily’s femme fatale girlfriend has been conveniently written out of the script, as Patrick Henningsen commented to me.
       </p>

      <p>
       Ah yes, the famous "
       <strong>
        THE GUY'S HEAD DIDN'T EXPLODE LIKE IT DOES IN THE MOVIES
       </strong>
       " line. You can always tell who has no idea what they're talking about when they make these kind of claims. Only a specific set of circumstances causes mass trauma to the head from a GSW, contrary to what Hollywood action movies taught you.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The shooters were said to be military-trained and had contacts with terror cells[7] and Anwar al-Awlaki, a known asset of western intelligence, as well as seeking revenge for the 1995 RER convction of Rachid Ramda. The terrorists had also reportedly returned from training in Syria,[8] where the French, UK and US governments had been arming and training the Al-Qaeda affiliated “Free Syrian Army.” Coulibaly also met with French President Nicholas Sarkozy in 2009[9] , looking for employment.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is no "proof" of a "false-flag" here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A key investigator of the incidents has now turned up dead from, you got it, “suicide.”[12] Important individuals in the 9/11 event mysteriously turned up dead, too,[13] and members of the power structure that pry too deeply end up gone.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This story is entirely fabricated. Not true at all, and is being pushed by propagandists pushing the "false-flag" narrative. Nice job falling for propaganda. The guy wasn't even a "key" investigator either, he was one of
       <strong>
        THOUSANDS
       </strong>
       of officers working the case.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Soon after the shooting, Kouachi supposedly left his ID laying in a vehicle.[14] This calls into question at least his supposed expertise and tactical training, and is also reminiscent of the passport of the 9/11 hijacker. [15] What is more likely is that they had a handler who was intelligent, possibly the femme fatale who disappeared from the narrative, while the Jihad cut outs were duped.

       If you watched the video, they were in a rush to escape. Entirely plausible. The MO of terrorists is typically to die a marytr, so if you think they were trying to avoid being identified, you have no idea how terrorism works.

        In the wake of the events, freedom of speech and Internet monitoring are the buzzwords,[16] with the Atlanticist establishment all singing in harmony the 9/11 narrative of needing more security, more surveillance, more police, more crackdowns[17] (the more money thrown at them, the more terror comes) – not on Jihadis running free with state knowledge,[18] but on all citizens. Terrorism, you see, is a psychological attack on the public, and rogue, asymmetrical rogue terror is extremely rare. What is not rare is state-funded or private funded false flag terror.

       Right, but nobody gets upset over drawings except muslims. Not enough to murder people anyway. If it was israel they probably could've thought of a cleaner way to censor than a massive false flag operation.

       proved my point. Israel would just get the cartoon discontinued or shut down. I mean France has hate speech laws so I'm kinda baffled they don't do that in the first place. Wouldn't be that difficult, although I suppose gives more ammos to nazis.

       you proved that the Jews did it once more than 20 years ago. Muslims regularly threaten and kill people based on drawing offensive pictures of muslims. I feel like one explanation is more likely than the other. I don't feel like the Jews NEEDED to do this.

       That's super great that you feel that way.  I'm discussing facts and presenting historical precedent.  Your feelings are irrelevant when discussing things like that.  I don't care how you feel about the existence of frogs, there are frogs.  Furthermore, what evidence (not circumstantial or speculative) do you possess that these fellows were even muslim?

       because it's a reality you seem to be having a problem with.  You stated that no one gets upset.  I pointed out that you're mistaken.  Now you will go to the 'well, that was 27 years ago, it surely has never happened since, they crossed their heart and hoped to die when they promised.'

       Silly me... I still think real terrorists use real bullets.  Why did your terrorists leave their car, run to the cop, shoot him and then run back to their getaway car and then drive away? Why bother killing a cop who was already down?  Maybe it looked just looked good for the camera overhead?
