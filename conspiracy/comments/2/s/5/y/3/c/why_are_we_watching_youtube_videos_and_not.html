       I've literally spent 100s of hours in the last two years, on reddit, on YouTube, reading books, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       FOR WHAT?! I'm not preventing any events. I'm not informing people who are not already aware of corruption and deceit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When do we assemble? When do we become an organized group that assembles logical information that can be easily digestible to someone completely unfamiliar with the depth of the world politics facade? Something that rips the band-aid off, without invoking a knee-jerk "omg, you are CRAAAAAAA-ZY" response.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a media team. People making attractive, logical, non-offensive flyers. We should be burning DVDs and CDs and leave them in laundry mats, at bus stops, in cafes. WE SHOULD DO WHAT THE BIBLE THUMPERS DO, offering free food with some conversation and literature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't we creating a massive petition campaign against CISPA? Are you afraid of using the White House petition site? WHY?!

       How naive you are. What you think is the enemy is not nearly your true enemy.

      <p>
       This is a part of why it's hard to organize things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the only things you talk about being "organized" and "political" are exactly the things the media have been manipulating for us to feel outraged about all along.

       Well I'd like to start off by saying I'm 12, and my mom buys me everything, but, I have been noticing recently a decrease in my supply of chocolate milk, after careful observations I have found this is most likely due to an increase in chocolate milk prices, a lot of people are silent on this front and I think it has a lot to do with the President of the United State of America(aka Obama) defending his own (brown protects brown). This is a liberal - sociological pedigree but together we need to take action.

       Not only this but have you prices regular milk lately? Shit is getting expensive.

       They make false conflict in humanity like religion(you said "bible thumpers", so Mr-You is ,maybe implying you have fallen for this false conflict).  There are other divisions like race, political party, Cops vs Protesters, divisions within political movements that are constructed ways to divide, and keep the people down.  If you think about it, by saying "bible thumper", you just alienated a few billion people that maybe would have otherwise helped your cause.  Tons of people who believe in the bible are also aware, and opposed to things like the IMF, and Federal Reserve.  Just because they have SOME differences in belief does not mean we cannot come together for the things we agree on(and in fact, it is necessary).

       I'm not going to stand next to some dude that wants to print fliers about chemtrails, he doesn't want to have to deal with some dude's anti-vax preaching, the anti-vax dude wants nothing to do with the holocaust denier, who in turn doesn't want to deal with anarcho-capitalists shouting about bitcoin...

       This isn't a single-issue sub, or even an umbrella sub. This is a sub dedicated with hundreds of opinions and issues that simply cannot work together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, can you name a single issue everybody here will agree with and rally behind?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to get more specific and say "we anti-CISPA people need to organize," that's fine. But that's probably not even half of the people here. It might only be a tiny fraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I ask you: "Why haven't you gotten together with like-minded people already?" Other people have. What's stopping you, and why do you assume everybody else is inside watching videos and not out on the streets, anyways? A lot of people are actually activists and researchers and public speakers. You could be one too, if you wanted.

       It is. my friends mock that I post here but the truth is I just avoid the lizard people Chem trail holocaust stuff, and the threads I do participate in usually have like minded people there because they too seek the more mainstream theories.

       The only thing you could maaaaybe use this board to rally support for would be if someone formed a political party who's sole goal was truth and reconciliation in America, shoring up the constitution and then dissolving government for new elections a few months later.

       Page five has the first mention of "chemtrails" though they obviously aren't called this.
      </p>
      <p>
       And one, very non-revisionist, article published by the Center for holocaust and genocide studies at the university of Minnesota:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.chgs.umn.edu/museum/memorials/auschBirkMem/index.html">
        http://www.chgs.umn.edu/museum/memorials/auschBirkMem/index.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       With the pertinent text being:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The memorial, too, has changed throughout the years. The plaques indicating that "4 million people" were killed at Auschwitz were removed in 1990. They were replaced with plaques stating the more accurate figure of “one and a half million.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No one "denies" the holocaust, they argue about the historical validity of the details.

       Missed your pertinent text there. I'll be reading later.  I dabble in most theories.  Go engineering is a thing I know there have indeed literally been Chem trails.   It is the scope of the deployment I question.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Holocaust...  AFAIK it indeed occurred, may be embellished and the worst starvation was probably a result of Germany losing the war, but I prefer to avoid it as a topic because needing to rub elbows with outright deniers really just makes me sick.  It is milked too much for sympathy and not enough as an object lesson about creeping hatred in society.

       If someone claimed (for sake of argument) that Niel Armstrong never went to the moon, but the rest of the astronauts did, is he denying the moon landing?

       Probably a wise stance, but you'd be amazed how many people are totally unaccepting, even of government sources (incidentally, the best sources to make pro-vaxxers head explode from cognitive dissonance).

       OF COURSE very many Jews died in the work camps, but at least 90% of the deaths were due to typhus and unsanitary conditions as the German supply lines went down. It's been proven that there were NO gas chambers. Think about it...if you witnessed one you wouldn't have lived through it as the "supposed" gas chambers would have killed every person that was within a few hundred feet AND would have killed anyone that handled the bodies not long after the "gassings" as the myth says they did. Hell, they wouldn't even work at all as gas chambers without hermetically sealed doors and sparkproof lighting as HCl gas is EXTREMELY flammable and leaves blue, permanent stains on the walls...instead they show cheap, gas-leaking wood doors that open INWARD and no blue stains. When I went to Auchwitz it was SO obviously fake. You can even see where the partitions were in the original room before it was "faked" into a "gas chamber."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also been proven that it would have taken a crematoria many. many years and LOTS of fuel to burn all those bodies...the math just doesn't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it: German men were off to war and SOMEBODY needed to build the weapons...the camps are where Jewish, Italian, Gypsies, and POWs were taken and made to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Germans did NOT want to lose their work force and, before the supply lines broke down, took rather good care of the Jews. Auschwitz had a library, a swimming pool, an orchestra, a theater, showed films (mostly propaganda)...even a camp brothel!
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust is nothing but a money grab. Sure many Jews died (around 300,000 according to the Red Cross) and this is UNACCEPTABLE...but many more Americans died fighting for our freedom. And Stalin made Hitler look like a choirboy. Now it's all about taking "reparations" from Germany...still...70+ years later.

        I

       don't want to be ejected from my country (us Jews have been expelled from, what now, 120 or so countries since 1AD?) because of the monkey business of a few Ashkenazi assholes who like to steal and gamble with other people's money and claim reparations from events that didn't even come close to happening (like the electric floors, geysers of blood, and
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       open-pit cremations)...among
       <em>

       You need to know your audience. Different stories mean different things depending on how far down the rabbit hole you go. And there's no standardized conspiracy merit badge system where you hold up your 9/11 flair, next to your Boston Strong pin and your #sandyhoax button.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because despite what you see here, a vast majority of the population don't give a shit. They've been so sensitized to
       <em>
        terrorism
       </em>
       that they don't know what's what. They don't ask for sources. They don't care at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So until we get a solid idea to take care of things, or to get people to even care about things (they are being spied on all day and willingly Like and Share more), you'll just be spinning your wheels wasting energy and becoming more frustrated.
      </p>

       I don't Facebook, but I have a friend who made fun of his neighbor for always posting "kooky conspiracy stuff".  I was sad to see that it was all things I agreed with, but memetically presented in such a cringy way so as to alienate people who don't already agree.

       That's one of many reasons why I can't stand meme posts and most image posts on this sub.  A picture doesn't fucking say a thousand words, with topics like these you may need ten thousand words just to say a thousand, at times.

       I think the problem is often that those who post memes on facebook etc are the type of people who do no actual research for themselves. When pushed for answers deeper than the meme provides, they have nothing, and make all alternative thinkers seem uninformed.

       That may be part of it, but more importantly is the revulsion (or perhaps amusement) felt by most in response to this stimuli, as they generally won't even bother asking more questions to discover the poster is uninformed.

       Because no one wants to get beat, arrested, lose their job, and get followed by government minders? Or killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Media doesn't cover protests it doesn't agree with?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the American people don't give a shit about protest?

       It's a dangerous time to be an activist. The internet is an excellent tool for subverting the status quo, and perhaps one of the few effective ones left. We are up against The Media, primarily - fighting for the hearts and minds of the people, to steal their weasel wording. If you try to fight The Media in the streets, they will just cut you out of the conversation and create their own. On the internet, you have a better chance of being heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think people aren't paying attention to the internet... well, YOU'RE here, aren't you?
      </p>

       Keep fighting. ON and Offline.

       We are all addicted and reliant on the economic system in place. People are afraid to quit their jobs for they will lose their homes and possessions. So many people are so invested into the system that they would die to keep it.

      <p>
       Also, too many people are still distracted by entertainment such as: Movies, video games, and sports. To me it really replaces the responsibility of having to care about real things.

       If it's to happen, it'll have to be spontaneous.The more you shout and scream, the more crazy you seem and the less people pay attention to you and the easier it is to claim you're just a tin foil hat wearing imbecile.

       Slowly but surely the masses are waking up to these things.They knew something wasn't right but were unsure what. now more and more are asking questions, are listening to others and beginning to not listen to the talking heads.

       Most of what's being done can still be undone overnight.

       It will happen. It will be a flash in the powder room and the whole thing will then explode and people all over the country will stop what they're doing and participate.

       I share your frustration. However, people are too comfortable in their fantasy world to be bothered with anything resembling reality. Besides people have to be open to the information or at least open-minded to hear anything you are saying. It sucks but you cant force someone to do something, however if you made it less comfortable for them.....and maybe direct their anger towards what you want....but then you would just be the very thing we are all fighting against. Sigh......Also alot of people are doing the things you are demanding already, maybe do some research and hook up with them?

       It's really difficult to rally around a common goal when everyone in a country has a different goal and agenda and belief system. That's why nationalism was killed in the first place. It was too dangerous to the industrialists and politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to make a difference is to do it one country at a time. You need to be able to hold those within the country accountable by closing these neo-liberal borders and regaining control over the political structure including the monetary system and removing the internationalist from the equation. They are why the world is in the gutter. Only when you can get your country back to being a nation and not an outlet or home base for international, criminal behavior can you begin to not only solve your own problems, but the world's problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the world went through a massive campaign of propaganda, misinformation and brainwashing as well as an injection of people and cultures that do not line up. People were taught that individualism is better than community and that tolerating everything means a better lifestyle. Unfortunately this has lead to the ability of higher powers to use terrorism to push people in different and foreign directions. They've been pitted against each other in the competitive world of capitalism disguised under Bolshevism. They've accepted that they are on their own and that things like feminism, racism and other minor things in the West are more important than the fact that the Western governments are still proponents of violence, slavery and crimes against its own citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       To unite the people of a country in the West would be quite a feat. Western countries used to be the most powerful on Earth. They were the fastest growing in intellect and in national pride and duty but that was destroyed with WW2 and the lies that occurred to establish a new world environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The task is very big. I don't think it's impossible but there is a lot to be done to reverse the damage of the last 100 years. The fact is, white Europeans still make up a large majority in their own lands (for now), but they are all too scared to say anything or to do anything to help their communities and to provide a better environment for their children. They've been turned into cowards and turned against their own blood to be sensitive to the people who will eventual destroy them and the way of life their ancestors fought for. Everyone has respect for everyone but themselves. To turn it around, we need people to realize they are worth something again and that individuals are wonderful but individualism is causing a rift between people and their communities and the people they should be caring about. People won't defend what they don't have. And right now, they don't have anything but themselves and the beliefs they were taught.

       So, watching YouTube videos isn't motivating resistance, but you suggest making more of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great irony in your presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, the simple truth here is that the power structure prevents any single person from emerging to lead any sort of meaningful resistance. Not only that, but it is now also prepared and practiced at quelling any form of spontaneous group resistance thanks to the failed Occupy movement.

       But in order to watch YouTube videos, there must be people who made them. So there are people who do more than just watch them.
Also watching them makes people share them,  which spreads an idea that 'they' don't want us to have. Even if only a few get it, those few may be all that matter.
In psychology [keeping ideas, memes alive], there are tellers, spreaders and doers. All three are just as important as each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tellers are those that tell a good tale, know how to get it across, can make websites and know their media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spreaders are those that know a lot of people and spread these ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doers are those that are not really interested in the above [does't exclude them though] but are very good at taking action and are not afraid of the consequences.

       All are needed!

       I've wondered that myself. I think it's simply because the masses are too distracted with more personal problems, and divided by issues such as race, gender, culture, class, etc. It's hard for everyone to unite under a single cause. The higher level you go the more outrageous people will think of the cause.

       imo, those that take the time to post to his site are only expressing their opinion/dislike of what's going on in the world (which is more than i can say about others that don't know squat), the number of people 
(on this sub) may seem like a lot, but it's a small amount, really, more than half of the US population needs to
       <em>
        get with it
       </em>
       to get any serious attention, but this is only my opinion,
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm speaking for myself, i've signed more petitions than i can count, i get automated emails from my representative(s), and that's about it,
      </p>
      <p>
       but i keep signing anyway, all is not lost (yet), i think the globalists are fearful, even it's only a little bit, we will keep on keeping on, we can't give up - won't give up

       It's said that it only takes 3.5% of the population engaging in peaceful protest to overthrow the government. Here's a source I found on mobile real quick.

       Change doesn't happen if the majority doesn't want it. People are in denial and are afraid of change. Occupy failed because instead of occupying Wall Street they occupied a park and became something entirely different than the original purpose of OWS.

       Freedom of assembly was quietly done away with, blocking traffic is terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a car based society, in hitchiker's guide ford prefect thought cars were the dominant lifeform...that's a very insightful point that we should all keep in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no place in an american city for people to gather because they'd have to get there with cars and there would be no place to put those cars, so basically going to a protest is such a huge risk of your car getting towed and since only people for whom 500 buck tow charges are a lot of money would want to protest anyway....
      </p>
      <p>
       The car centric culture's side-effect of limiting mass demonstration is going to be something that is historically going to be calculated into what is going on right now.  It's a form of chains, having to buy fuel, having to buy tires, having to buy insurance, having to wait in traffic, having to find parking, have a car loan, these things are all counter-revolutionary in a big way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cars can give you freedom, but they can also trap you in a hundred ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what mr-you said is also true, if you listen between the lines, everything that would be required for organizing politically is psychically discouraged on CNN et al.

       Two points:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) You can be the change you want to see. Think we should be offering food to people, along with the truth? Then host dinner parties where the theme of the evening is 'alternative opinions'. Anybody who turns up is at least likely to hear you out. Think we should be handing out dvds? Then burn a heap and hand them out yourself when shopping, catching the bus, etc etc. One man can make a difference to those around him.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) People
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       doing media work collaboratively. See 'We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook'. See
       <a href="https://vid.me/VSI7">
        WDIL

       The changes you want to see happen gradually then suddenly. Have faith.

       Just today I learned an interesting lesson from my cello teacher. She said your mind makes sense of the music at least five times quicker then your physical body does. Meaning even though we can think and understand what we are supposed to be doing our bodies are always behind the curve trying to catch up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there's a connection here. Maybe we are just in the learning/understanding phase on a mental level and we've yet to take any steps physically to manifest the new reality we seem to be steering towards.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me personally I haven't got into any of the activist groups because I don't have the time or means to dedicate myself to any cause. I am however trying to start a band so I can show my resistance to the system through my music. For now that's all I can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we'll know when the time is right to hit the streets. For now I'd rather keep a low profile so as not to become chowder for the pigs.

       It's called apathy, my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, coupled with the fact that Amerikka is now a full-on police state, scares a lot of people away from protesting ANYTHING and the pigs will do nearly ANYTHING to get you into a for-profit privatized prison. There are FAR more prisons in the US than there are colleges at this point!
      </p>
      <p>
       A coordinated, armed revolt attended by MILLIONS would be the only way that a "protest" outside of a "free speech zone" could work. It's not like I'd mind seeing some bad pigs wiped out.

       Calm down. Think about a solution and go for it without telling anybody. That has the biggest probability of success and if you fail you did not think long enough.
      </p>

       Emotions are never a good advidsor. You just get trapped in infiltrated groups where the leaders are helping your enemies and you have to compromise and get send in the wrong direction.
