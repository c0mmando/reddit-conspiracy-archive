       Now, individuals and organizations that attempt to restore the values that our founders once believed in so strongly are regarded as dangerous “extremists” that need to be watched carefully.
      </p>

       Sadly, most Americans don’t even realize what is happening to this nation.  As long as they are fed a constant diet of mindless entertainment, most Americans are perfectly content to let “the experts” do their thinking for them.

       Forefathers had slaves and didn't want to sharply divide or perhaps not even create the colonies by explicitly condemning or promoting slavery.  The result was the civil war three generations later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alexander Hamilton and his compatriots were explicitly centrist and did not believe in state's rights or that the gentry were educated enough to vote.  He would have thought the electoral college a splendid development.

      <p>
       The imagery of those old, rich, landowning whites is tainted and has nothing to do with contemporary times.  I'd rather shed a tear for what MLK Jr. and RFK would say about our current status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       And most of the rights we associate with America do not come directly from the Bill of Rights, but from precedent-setting interpretations of them by the Supreme Court and subsequent laws enacted according to the restrictions of the related amendments.

       This is naive.  A lot of times we, the readers, are not being distracted, but any who would report on or otherwise write about other issues are.  Whatever we are supposed to not see most likely has very little discussion about it in public.

       If you guys really want to make a difference become citizen journalists.  There's a reason journalists are explicitly murdered and covertly (or metaphorically) assassinated.

       The forefathers concept was of a federation of states, creating a republic that adheres to a constitution that incorporated democratic principles. They themselves might have  owned slaves, but they damn well knew what they were doing. They drafted legislation to allow for future populations to decide for themselves whether or not there were to be slaves owned in their own states.
      </p>
      <p>
       The civil war had more to do with the federal governments overreach and the infringement of states rights, on a fundamental level, which was an argument brought about by the division of thought on topics such as slavery and economics and representation of the populace.
      </p>

       Slavery wasnt the biggest issue, and lincoln (per some theories, not necessarily my own belief) only used the emancipation proclamation because he knew that it woukd seriously wound the confederates and help the North win the war.

       I think the control of resources trumps slavery from a business perspective. What good are slaves when you've lost your main producer? They sacrificed their slaves so they could control the board. They got their slaves back in the 30's when the governments of the world began selling their people back to the banks.

       so basically the north fought the south to end slavery, then, once all those land owners no longer held slaves, they enslaved the entire population, no matter the creed. All while in the guise of freedom. Those guys are some smart d-bags.

       No. They fought over control and resources under the guise of freeing the slaves. After freeing the slaves the banking sector collapsed and the nation sold the population back into slavery for loans. Besides, slavery exists all over the planet under globalism. And with neo-liberal border policies, wages are so low that everyone might as well be slaves and work for food.

       Linking to r/history automatically makes me hit the snooze button. How can people deny history when history is made up by the victors? History is a subjective subject. It's up to interpretation and often lacks complete context. So linking me to a sub that strictly adheres to the official story with no possibility to alteration would equate to linking me to an religious sub that just keeps sticking to their story. I'm not interested in religion and I'm certainly not interested in rigid, one-sided information.

       Scroll down to see my other post and then think about it. Why would slavery matter when the South was going to secede and take their cash crops with them? Slavery doesn't really matter when you have nothing to harvest. The North was bankrupt and the South was about to rear-end them. They got their slaves back plus more in the end and kept the South. Seems like economics is the source cause and that slavery was the North's gimmick. Just like the end of segregation was a gimmick of the Democrats after they had already created the KKK to sway voting. No one cares about the slaves or black people, they care about power and money. If they can gain those two things, they will use any platform they need.

       KKK or integration. Slavery or "freedom." Doesn't matter.

       In any case, the link is a thread with many contemporary early Civil War documents from Southern states regarding their motivations for disunion.
       <strong>
        Primary documents
       </strong>
       -- not the "official story." The story from the horse's mouth -- slavery was a major reason. To say the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery is incorrect.

       Yes and I believe that those documents are great from a political angle but they are not the reason behind the civil war. I believe those documents as much as I believe the documents that drew the US into a war with Iraq. Terrorism or slavery, political motivations are not the driving force behind change. They are the platforms and gimmicks and propaganda that is used to grease the wheels of motion. To get the public vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Economics is the reason for every war since the dawn of time. Sure wars have been fought over religion, but in reality, those wars were about plundering gold and controlling resources, and the religious angle was to get people behind it and make them feel obligated and to control others. The real driving force behind war is not the masses and their feelings. People are small and weak and easily controlled. The driving force is always the big industrialists and thinkers who are in the minority and are sociopaths who know how to play the game and have the resources to do it. Don't mistake controlling forces for motivation.

       As someone who's studied this topic quite a bit, I'll chime in with this:
      </p>
      <p>
       The South pretty much only seceded because of slavery. Any source can pretty much tell you that. But I see the point this guy is trying to make. Why did the union care about the south seceding? I haven't studied this side of it enough to give a great answer, but to my understanding it's a combination of factors, one of which was indeed that the north needed cash crops from the south. Another being that Lincoln, among others, was very fond of the Union being a Union and didn't want it dismantled.

       The economic issues were slavery issues.

       Lincoln didn't want to give up on the union, fine. That doesn't touch why the South seceded. Lincoln's desires were a reaction, not the cause.

       That's exactly what I said, I'm agreeing with you. I'm talking about the reaction, the reason for the war, which I
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       is what the guy above you was saying. That the north only wanted the south back because they needed the production.

       The comment seems to have a somewhat dismissing tone to it as though we need to just let it all go and start over. I think that would be the worst decision we could make at this time, at least IMHO. We should try to fix it first.

       Haven't the decades of voting and marches shown you that real change or fixing has and will be undermined or highjacked? I'm not so certain or can be fixed lest we pretty much gut it all. Then what would we have?  We'd have to start over as there wouldn't be anyone there.  Or maybe he's an anarchist.

       person responds to criticism with "BUT YOU OFFER NO SOLUTIONS"?  It's the same nonsense that afflicted the OWS movement.  Here we go: repeal the patriot act, stop our aggressive warlike action overseas, dismantle the NSA dragnet, implement a basic income via negative taxrate for those earning less than $100,000 a year individually.

       Much more to both, but here is an easy to digest explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basic Income - The government pays the people a flat rate to provide all the necessities and live fairly comfortably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Negative taxrate - People who make below a set threshold are paid the difference by the government instead of taxed. People who make above said threshold are taxed appropriately.

       That's what I want to know. They came from Hobbes and Locke. They were studying the origins of civilization and government. Were they perfect? No. But their idea has been better than any ever since, and at least we have the wherewithal now to understand how dastardly slavery was as an institution.

       Just because they got a few things wrong, doesn't make what they got right null and void. The Bill of Rights is one of the most important series of edicts ever codified by man and law.

       Reconstruction is basically 1865 onward. The entire foundation of the south had been destroyed and many northerners wanted retaliation for the 'rebels transgressions'. It is a period in time when the US would have to re-define itself as a country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of interesting questions posed here. Do we let the south back into the union? punishment? Slaves? they are essentially a new demographic. My favorite time period in american history for sure. Lots of laws and problems that challenged the standard social mesh.

       Do the think the fundamental principles they outlined in the original documents like the Constitution and Bill of Rights still apply? Or have we really slacked off as a nation in keeping with the times like it seems to my the founders actually wanted. Even if they never made the important steps forward themselves.

       In modern day, I believe the Constitution and Bill of rights are out of date. They were written for a fledgling colony hundreds of years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, anyone can twist the meaning to fit their agenda. I can just as easily say the second amendment doesn't  guarantee anyone guns because it requires them to be part of a "well trained militia". Just as easily I can say that we, in defending our homes, are a well trained militia and are justified in owning guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think upholding the constitution as some absolute truth is ridiculous considering its had to be amended countless times. Keep in mind, even before the 13th amendment (banning slavery) the constitution still read all men created equal.

       What?

      <p>
       He's not wrong. There's a lot that started taking place at the very turn of the century which backs up his statement. I'll say the establishment of the Federal reserve banking system, and income tax was a major catalyst to the crumbling of the United State's society and economic structure. That occurred sometime around 1913. Any other time in history, prior to the 1913 Federal reserve act, the proposal was shot down when brought to Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, along with the rise of major corporations, helped mutate the republic to an oligarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm not touching on what he was referencing, but, that's my viewpoint. Has nothing to do with race.

       The reconstruction has to do with the civil war and rebuilding the south and trying to remove their racist roots. So I think that should clarify it for you.

       It wasn't so much punishing the south but deciding what to do with it. The south almost immediately enacted the 'black codes' which were basically watered down slavery while 'radicals' in the north pushed for full rights.

       I'm mostly talking about how the Axis braintrust was imported almost whole cloth to the only surviving infrastructure after the vast majority of Europe was left a smoking ruin and how their continued research became the foundation of the Modern "Capitalist" society.

       The lessons learned from the Nationalist Socialist party's failures were noted and improved upon by the ruling class. Then applied directly to Western culture, overtly and covertly. And now here we are, a society that by and large aspires to psychopathy and ignores humanity. We treat our

       because "that's just the way it is", while never admitting that our 'way of life' is a direct result of the expansive (and expanding) suffering of the world. We've sacrificed our autonomy and sovereignty to embrace our role as the world's premier terrorist state.
      </p>
      <p>
       American Individuals abhor this reality, some go to great lengths to lie to themselves and others to escape it. But the simple truth is that we are an active part of the machine that is the Fourth Reich, and as a collective we are too sated and mindwashed to act against it.

       Do you have any more contextual references pointing to how the axis scientists that were imported during numerous operations used their research in america (or how they were used).

       I've heard this many times and it seems by and large to be true but I have yet to find much solid evidence outside the fact that their best and brightest definitely were smuggled out of Germany all throughout the war.

       It isn't considered anything, I was just stating facts.  Make of them what you will.  It isn't racist to point out that the US (and most of Europe) is and has always been dominated by powerful white men - I say this as a white man myself.  This is no more racist than pointing out that Jews are vastly over-represented in Hollywood relative to the percentage of the US population they make up.

       That's a totally different argument and not one I particularly like since, from my understanding, it hinges pretty much entirely on IQ scores which are problematic for a number of reasons.  And I also don't think those studies/tests can or do account for the myriad of differences between the various cultures and areas of the world and it would be difficult or impossible to create a test that would be interpreted exactly the same by anyone who took it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, a child from Africa who's never seen an IQ or standardized test before, let alone taken one, is obviously less equipped to do well than an American child who's grown up doing nothing
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       taking tests like that.

       But every piece of evidence I've ever seen is related to IQ scores which, again, are very problematic and not what I would consider "hard proof" by any means.

      <p>
       I'm not saying you or others who discuss such things are racist, far from it, I'm simply saying that to me those studies are in no way conclusive and have a ton of potential issues with regards to their validity - at least from the ones I've examined in the past.

       You can even keep the comparison in the US: someone from a middle/high income white household, who likely comes from a family of people educated similarly to themselves, is obviously better equipped to score well on a standardized test than a black teenager living in the ghetto who comes from a family with a history of poverty and lack of education.  Most of the studies I've read about this claim to have accounted for these biases and made completely objective tests that can be taken by anyone around the world in the same context, but I would argue that this is close to if not literally impossible.

       I understand your argument that it is very difficult to do this, but many things in science are difficult, yet completely possible. For instance, twins separated at birth, but brought up in competely different countries, households, whatever, would provide a great data point.

       Exactly - but I've never gotten a sense that things like this have ever been done by those who've worked in this field of research.  It seems like they're out to prove their hypothesis that there is a difference in intelligence between races at all costs and haven't really bothered looking in much depth at the tens, hundreds, thousands of other factors.  I could be wrong of course but that's the sense I've always gotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also be interested to see these studies done on a per income basis.  For example, do black inner city kids test worse than black kids from higher income families?  I would guess that they do, and I would expect the difference to be statistically significant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing to consider is all of the aspects of human thought/intelligence that are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       included in IQ.  The most eloquent speaking friend I have, as well as the most artistic, is someone who I would say is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       intelligent (and you would most definitely agree if you met him) but his IQ score wouldn't blow anyone away whereas I myself have scored high on IQ tests in the past yet don't consider myself intellectually superior to him in any way.

       Just my thoughts.  But anyway thanks for the .pdf, I just saved it to my computer and will read through it when I have some time tonight or tomorrow.

       It's a fact, and it affects the meaning of the Constitution.  I'm sure if you revived a Founder in modern times, they'd say "Blacks and Indians and women owning guns ?  Oh, no, THAT's not what we meant !"

       Some of you seem to have a romantic, highly sanitized vision of what the Founding Fathers were trying to do with The Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Founding Fathers had little love of, or trust in, the "common person". They found the population as a whole to be rather uneducated, superstitious, foolish, and, all too often, inebriated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal of the Founding Fathers was to protect the Ruling / Wealthy Elite from being killed and eaten by The Masses. They did this by writing into The Constitution the
       <em>
        illusion
       </em>
       of self-governance. A Republic rather than a Democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, and more importantly to my point, the Founding Fathers wrote into The Constitution the Electoral College. This was a small body of individuals hand-selected by the rulers of the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it was originally created, by the Founding Fathers, the Electoral College totally overrides the Popular Vote. There were no rules, no formulas, no nothing, to tie the Electoral College to the Popular Vote. It was totally possible for The People to vote 100% for Candidate A, then The Electoral College to vote 100% for Candidate B.
      </p>
      <p>
       It never happened, of course, but that's the system that our Founding Fathers gave us. Now that there are rules for how the Electoral College must vote (each state has its own, but it's either 100% to the winner of the popular vote or split by percentage as the popular vote), the Ruling Elite have had to change their game plan. Instead of relying on the Electoral College to ensure the right person / people get elected, they instead rig the game so that almost 100% of the candidates are bought and paid for, rendering the popular vote all but irrelevant.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The country that our forefathers founded is DYING
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The system is as it ever has been - it exists for the benefit of Wealthy / Ruling Class. The only difference is that
       <strong>
        the illusion of self-governance is crumbling
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise stated, the country that our Founding Fathers founded is now an amplified version of that which they originally designed.

       Most people do realize that something is wrong and do not wish to lose status, power, money, or income.  They will keep silent even in complete privacy due to fear of reprisal from the systems discussed daily elsewhere.  It is also much easier for them to believe a part of the narrative; the expenditure of caloric energy and inducement of pain from thinking of emotionally devastating things--such as that we are in an Orwellian reality and even most wealthy people are impotent to change it--is very real and people are avoiding it in a myopic attempt to survive.

       The same populist movement invites debates from everyone each week at it's meetings, which are open to anyone. This seems like a good return to true democracy and will foster small government. How do we set up a similar system to get local discussions going in neighborhoods across the US, and possibly have a national populist government in 20 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that may be our only hope.

       TLDR: the world of today is better than it ever has been and all the proof of that you will ever need is probably staring at you right in the face, because your technological advancements and good-living are littered around your fucking living room, and it's also represented by what you are doing with your fucking fingers right now(or voice, cus dude got fucking voice interpreting computers and shit now make your voice into TEXT son transmit that shit through lights in the fucking ground called "fiber-optic cable" buried in the ground son) and the infrastructure running it and managing it transmitting your
       <em>
        shit
       </em>
       all over the world moments after you think of it. Shit needs to be kept tight to manage that shit, yo, if they weren't doing it you would be, or you'd be wishing you were smart enough to, and then you'd want to protect all your game n shit, and you'd hire and train dudes with big dicks to go fuck your enemies. The world has never been the utopia you're thinking of, and it's better right now for everyone and full of more opportunities for everyone and is growing at a more rapid  pace in all sectors of human knowledge than it ever has been. Grow up kids, take the rose-colored glasses off, "the founders" are a myth as is the founding mythology surrounding every single country on planet Earth, men with those names might have existed, but their real legend is not the one you're taught in school, the world is a more complex and nuanced place than
       <em>
        all of you
       </em>
       are making it - and it always has been - and probably will be for the foreseeable future.

       Your "founding forefathers" were racist war criminals whose policies were responsible for the genocide of my people, the theft of our lands, and destruction of our culture. I know the WASP patriots don't like to hear this shit. They say "get over it" and "I didn't steal your land, that was a long time ago" or sometimes "fuck you prairie nigger you needed to be exterminated now go back to your reservation get drunk and wait for your welfare check". To which I say, that's not how it works you get the check first. Just accept your history for what it is, what happened happened nothing can be done about it...but dont bullshit about it. Stop propping up these old racist dick heads up - we can do better.

       The country fell back when they started the Federal Reserve. Plain and simple. THE MONEY IS OWNED BY A PRIVATE HOLDER. At least Jackson was able to destroy the WORSHIPPERS OF business and money for a short time..The World is being taught that $$$ is everything and that $$$ is what YOU NEED ..WAKE UP  its life and the natural law/MORAL Law that you should follow or $$$ and the more we follow $$$ the more we fulfill every negative prophecy that our fore fathers warned us about.

       LOL this country was dead after it ethnically cleansed the indigenous people of the land.  We were founded on colonialism, slavery, and economic separation... Our Founders were racist, sexist, rich, white devils.  America never existed, only Amerikkka and until we burn it to the ground and start fresh with true equality we will always be stuck in this cesspool of hate.  Its the Amerikkkan way

       We are living at the end of an Empire. In the history of Empires we are barely a blip compared to ones that lasted thousands of years. We won't even be remembered except by weird history nerds a couple hundred of years from now.

       Died long ago. Lately I'm curious of what they would think but I'm sure they were as much of scumbags as today's presidents. It's hard to imagine someone in power that isn't corrupt in any country or place. Somebody is always willing to fuck over another. I guess that's "human nature"

       The civil cult surrounding them and the foundation of the US is one of the best examples of psyops of all time. It breeds a sense of fealty to a mythology that can be endlessly reinterpreted as the years go by. It is exactly as bad as religion in that regard, because it

       a religion.

       Toss the patriotic bullshit from your mind and deal with present reality. What's wrong right now? How do you fix it? It does not matter what a handful of rich assholes thought 200 years ago. That is a sideshow intended to keep people from taking hold of their destiny.

       Yes and I believe that those documents are great from a political angle but they are not the reason behind the civil war. I believe those documents as much as I believe the documents that drew the US into a war with Iraq. Terrorism or slavery, political motivations are not the driving force behind change. They are the platforms and gimmicks and propaganda that is used to grease the wheels of motion. To get the public vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Economics is the reason for every war since the dawn of time. Sure wars have been fought over religion, but in reality, those wars were about plundering gold and controlling resources, and the religious angle was to get people behind it and make them feel obligated and to control others. The real driving force behind war is not the masses and their feelings. People are small and weak and easily controlled. The driving force is always the big industrialists and thinkers who are in the minority and are sociopaths who know how to play the game and have the resources to do it. Don't mistake controlling forces for motivation.

       As someone who's studied this topic quite a bit, I'll chime in with this:
      </p>
      <p>
       The South pretty much only seceded because of slavery. Any source can pretty much tell you that. But I see the point this guy is trying to make. Why did the union care about the south seceding? I haven't studied this side of it enough to give a great answer, but to my understanding it's a combination of factors, one of which was indeed that the north needed cash crops from the south. Another being that Lincoln, among others, was very fond of the Union being a Union and didn't want it dismantled.
