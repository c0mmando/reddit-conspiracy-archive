<p>I quite enjoyed <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2s0ci0/flight_mh17_was_downed_by_the_53rd_russian_air/cnlhh2c">this comment</a>, courtesy of <a href="/u/tksmase">/u/tksmase</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So hold on. Hold on with me here. I read this and the proof they gave was:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Now, let us try the impossible – we want to find out which Russian officer ordered the missile launch. Kursk, December 2014. The 53rd air defense brigade is situated in a pine forest east of the city. Even the name sounds like a tank rolling over asphalt [name is the proof]; not far from the city [close to the scene of crime? totally guilty]; the German Wehrmacht and the Soviet army fought one of the largest tank battles in history in the summer of 1943 – with over 10,000 vehicles. [how is this relevant to the MH17 tragedy?]&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Followed by a pretty well written story the likes of which I would probably find in my local library, hidden far away from any kinds of reliable investigative reports and actual information. Away to those shelves with sci-fi and fantasy books for your imagination.</p>

<p>If anyone actually bothered to read the actual article and not only the title of link provided by <a href="/u/canausernamebetoolon">/u/canausernamebetoolon</a>...German investigative report my ass. This is written by two guys, one of which has a history of being &quot;subsequently charged with providing &quot;informational support to terrorism&quot; and forced to leave the country that had long been his primary &quot;beat&quot; while reporting in Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>The whole word &quot;German&quot; can&#39;t be even applied here as it would mean the article has some quality to it (besides being a fantasy novel). Even Kursk is located to north-west from Donetsk (I even checked the maps) instead of being close to the city and being located to the east. </p>

<p>They got everything wrong and wrote a story (the actual story, not an investigative report) and yall people get mad on it, condemn a foreign country you know nothing about (besides being unholy satanic evil) and demand a war. </p>

<p>For fucks sake this is why I believe humanity is doomed. All I need is to give you a fancy link name and you flip yourselves.</p>

<p>This is Onion material. This thing having 4002 upvotes at the time of my comment writing is the most ridiculous thing I&#39;ve seen today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yeah? Just read reddit&#39;s front page later today and I&#39;m you&#39;ll find something as ridiculous, if not more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed that too. Want to know something interesting? In that particular thread, there is actually a pretty good amount of top comments that attempt to call out the article for its unreliability. These rational comments at the top are a rare thing these days, <strong>except on weekends.</strong> During weekends, you see some semblance of light at times in between the darkness of the daily Two Minute Hate.</p>

<p>My theory is that the sockpuppet stations full of pro-US military men are run like any call center in the country, with lighter weekend hours and a looser structure on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>

<p>Because, using logic, if major subs like news, worldnews, and politics were not rigged then we would see an similar narrative on weekends to the ones we see on weekdays, just with a smaller participation from ALL sides.</p>

<p>So we <em>should</em> see the same reddit, only on a lesser scale. But we <strong>don&#39;t</strong> see that on weekends. We see the circlejerk narrative fracturing and allowing dissent through, almost as if the people paid to manipulate the site have &quot;weekend hours&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>  Thanks for quoting my comment haha. I actually love browsing this sub from time to time to get the other part of the story. </p>

<p>Besides that, all I wish is for people to get along. I am sick and tired of all these one-sided accusations and I am even more mad when people eat up an article making an absurd war crime accusation (which is illegal for example if you accuse an innocent [not proven guilty] person of it) without actually giving out any hard proof. It was even more saddening for me to see that novel hit frontpage and thereby (of course) indoctrinate a lot of people in the process right into thinking &quot;hey russia is bad i need more sanctions to make farmers and other members of working class suffer, maybe even military intervention and then finally a world war 3 scenario, that&#39;ll show em. fucking putin&quot;</p>

<p>So yeah guys. Stay safe and keep reading between the lines.</p>

<p>How did that work for pussy riot? How would that work if someone decided to protest the anti-gay laws of the government? How would a large scale anti-putin protest go down?</p>

<p>wait what? Could you please explain the law against &quot;gay propaganda&quot;. Many LGBT citizens have explained how it effects them. Gay teachers are not allowed to say that being gay is a normal thing. People can beat up gay people and nobody does anything about it because it&#39;s not a hate crime because Russia doesn&#39;t care. There is no freedom of press.</p>

<p>I think their political message is that Putin is a dictator who oppresses peoples rights. and then he oppressed their rights. And no, people who protest in america don&#39;t get thrown in jail.</p>

<p>Now, when the security at the Sochi olympics beat pussy riot with sticks for protesting. Which law were they breaking?</p>

<p>But please, just tell me what &quot;gay propaganda&quot; is, how it&#39;s bad, and why gay rights should take a backseat because &quot;think of the children&quot;. Also, explain why top russian diplomats associate gayness with pedophilia, and why gay bashing is at an all time high?</p>

<p>This is some impressive pro-russian apologia though, it&#39;s impressive the way a dictatorship can make people in democracies support them. I guess it&#39;s because you literally are not allowed to hear anything bad about Putin on Russian TV, so everyone must love him. I guess democracies are a bit tough for some, easier to just tell people to lead and be a &quot;strong leader&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s germany&#39;s stance on gay people? Are they allowed pride flags? Are they allowed to tell people publically that they&#39;re gay?</p>

<p>thank you and i&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve been fooled by the claim that there&#39;s such thing as &quot;gay propaganda&quot; or it&#39;s for the safety of the children (i mean wtf? putin even said it, this is just baffling you can pretend this isn&#39;t happening)</p>

<p>The police wouldn&#39;t do anything if they overheard you saying that.</p>

<p>They would be charged with assault and a hate crime, just like in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay, just wanted to double-check that you are totally lying about their laws.</p>

<p>from wikipedia:</p>

<p>Unlike in many western nations, LGBT persons in Russia do not enjoy increased and specific legal protections over other citizens. Violent criminal acts carried out against these persons are prosecuted as criminal offenses under Russian law, but the fact that these crimes are motivated by the sexual orientation or gender identity of the victim is not considered an aggravating factor when the court determines the sentence. Among the more vicious crimes that would qualify as hate crimes outside of Russia and are reported in the press would include the following;</p>

<p>On 9 May 2013, after Victory Day parades in Volgograd, the body of a 23-year-old man was found tortured and murdered by three males who stated anti-homosexual motivations, even though family and friends state the victim had no behavior inclination.[38]
On 29 May 2013, the body of 38-year-old deputy director of Kamchatka airport Oleg Serdyuk (rus: Олег Сердюк) was found in his burned out car, having been beaten and stabbed the previous day.[39] Local authorities said the murder was motivated by homophobia.[40] Three suspects (who were local residents) were tried and sentenced to jail terms of 9 to 12 years.[41]
From October 2013 - February 2014, anti-gay attacks targeting the LGBT community in Moscow were reported at Russia’s largest gay nightclub Central Station, including gunfire and gas attacks. Several attacks and victim responses were documented in an ABC News Nightline special &quot;Moscow is Burning&quot;.[42][43] Several employees subsequently left the country.[44]</p>

<p>Just look up LGBT rights in russia, I mean it&#39;s weird you&#39;d lie about this. Maybe you&#39;ve just been lied to and you really think that LGBT people have rights.</p>

<p>Again, tell me in your own words what &quot;gay propaganda&quot; is that these laws are designed to prevent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the most part, the public uncritically swallows the propaganda that is set before them by the media oligarchs. Most people are so caught up in the mental/emotional chaos of their daily lives that they have neither the time nor the inclination to question the veracity of the official story as proffered by pernicious politicians, bombastic bureaucrats and talking head commentators.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that most people still fully believe that Putin/Russia are the cause of all of the chaos in Ukraine, and are blissfully unaware of the US/Western sponsored coup that set this fiasco in motion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957"><strong>Ukraine crisis: Transcript of leaked Nuland-Pyatt call</strong></a></p>

<p>It may be interestind to bear in mind that one of conspirators exposed in the article - Assistant Secretary of State <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Nuland">Victoria Nuland</a>, is married to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kagan">Robert Kagan</a> - co-founder of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">Project for the New American Century</a> - the outfit that, prior to 9/11, called for a &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#.22New_Pearl_Harbor.22">New Pearl Harbor</a>&quot; incident to soften anticipated public resistance to their schemes.</p>

<p>Neuland, Kagan and the Krowd they run with are <em>very</em> adept at the game of political skulduggery. The mess we currently see in Ukraine a fine example of their handiwork, and the media moguls back them at every turn.</p>

It seems the whole point of this argument is to never quote Nuland because there&#39;s no real thing you could quote that admits the US started the Ukraine thing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the amount of evidence confirming Russia&#39;s involvement ...</p>

<p>Oh and they &quot;disagree with Putin&quot;? Do they actually have a political message? Go ahead, google them up. All they do is wear balaclavas, climb on busses and yell swear words through a moc while thrashing on a guitar.
