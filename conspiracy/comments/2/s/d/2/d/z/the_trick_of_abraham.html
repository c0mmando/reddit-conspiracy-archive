        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Good evening everyone, before I start my narrative here I just wanted to thank all of you that are genuinely taking time to investigate and thoroughly research outside of the basic history of your place of dwelling. Out of all places that I have done research (been researching &quot;conspiracy&quot; theories since 9/11) no place has given me the diversity and straight up intuitive resource as much as this sub. Yes I understand we&#39;ve been infiltrated hard by shills, naysayers, and the shit nozzles from conspiritard, but when it&#39;s all said and done I have gotten more legitimate information from here than any other place on the web. So thank you so much for your diligence. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s get to the point of this post. What I am here for tonight is to invoke conversation pertaining to Abrahamic religions, many people have already felt the notion that they were implemented as a central base of control. What I&#39;m looking for tonight is to get points of view from people that have had some basic study of Abrahamic theology and to see if there is any plausibility to my theory. I just want to say that I am in no way shape of form trying to sell what I am saying as a truth, but simply looking for open minds to discuss a theory. </p>

<p>My theory is that I believe that the Torah was a premise to thousands of years of intent slavery. I believe that the people that wrote the Torah, were the same people that wrote the New Testament, as well as the Quran. I do not think the Torah was inspired by &quot;God&quot; but instead inspired by a different higher power, most likely a technologically advanced species not familiar to humans. </p>

<p>The way I look at it is, if you could save resource why wouldn&#39;t you? Bestow upon a people that they are the &quot;chosen&quot; ones give them an ideology that consists of grandeur,subterfuge, and even tragedy as long as the ultimate goal is domination. Really, would a lower life form that was smart enough to realize that their existence would never be rivaled truly resist or turn down such an offer? </p>

<p>I think most of us believe that the ancient people of our race were very linear, and didn&#39;t really think this far ahead. I don&#39;t really believe that personally. If we look back to Sumerian texts, and even many Hindu texts that predate anything Abrahamic, we would understand that this is clearly not the case. </p>

<p>So I guess what I am asking is every free thinker, every single
person that is on this planet wondering what the hell is going on is 
this: Is this truly our human nature run amuck? is this what we are? Have we truly turned our eyes away from the beauty, and the natural splendor that our sight and our brains are allowed to register? If you even take the time to read this guess what? I love you. I truly love you. I really want every one to love each other. because I honestly believe that the love we feel  for anything that we compassionately want to save can turn tides. Never feel hopeless in this struggle to expose tyranny. Even if your family resents you for it, realize that there are a hundred more people behind that feeling
of hopelessness and neglect. Give me your thoughts here, and fuck downvotes. If you think internet points matter your pov is lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man. I like your way of thinking.</p>

<p>However, i dont think anybody really &quot;wrote&quot; the bible, torah, or koran. Not like how herman mellville wrote Moby Dick, anyhow.</p>

<p>Instead, i think some group in charge found ancient writings (rather, <em>more</em> ancient than they were) and read allllll the stories. Then, decided which stories to use to fit a psrticular agenda that they wanted to insure would survive through the ages...</p>

<p>How do you enslave an entire population? You make them agree to being enslaved. How? By making them believe thst they are specisl. Build them up. They are the Chosen Ones. Then, slap on a few commandments and voila!</p>

<p>Yes, thst was oversimplified, but i meant it as a short summary. Look into the Council of Nicea, and the Biblical Apocrypha.</p>

<p>There are alot of sources available where you can see that almost every single story in any if the abrahamic books were taken from older sources, like the sumerians you named, but also the zoroastrians, the pagans, etc. </p>

<p>Then, consider if you will the crusades, and how they wiped out the pagans almost entirely, took their stories, and adopted them, erasing all the known connections at that time (its one of the reasons why they had the crusades in the first place). </p>

<p>All three of these religions teach that <em>their</em> God is the one and only. Their stories all say essentially the same thing (they do differ a bit, but the essentials are there). And they all have some sort of &quot;Better Place&quot;, i.e. Heaven, when you die, to firther diminish their perspective of this current life. </p>

<p>Make people believe this, and you have an army who is more dedicated and more vigilant than anything ekse they had before. Plus, because you add in compassion for eachother, in a very conniving way, and you get a self-replicating system of perpetuating the enslavement of the very people doing most of the work to perpetuate the enslavemeng. </p>

<p>Yet, you add differences in each system, just enough so thst each God is different thsn the other two, and you create a perpetual world of conflict, creating despair, while offering compassion and love and forgiveness to further the cycle along as they turn for answers to why the world is so bad, eventually leading to despisal of the other religions for believing in the &quot;wrong&quot; God.</p>

<p>Its genius.</p>

<p>As to who created this ploy? Its just as plausible thst its of human origin as it is plausibke that it is from some other species. However, this is a slightly different conversation and i can talk about this one for hours... </p>

<p>Regardless of its origination  the answers to your questions are yes. This is our nature. We have turned away from natural beauty and the meaning of life. In our pursuit of happiness we bring others down so we can get a leg up. Status has become happiness. In our pursuit of happiness, we have become conceited, gluttonous, deluded, arrogant, intolerant, ignorant, and worst of all, unhappy.</p>

<p>Our very quest destroys us, because happiness is not found. It is felt. And abrahamic religions, imo, allow us to see the carrot, but not the fact that we are carrying the stick from which it dangles.</p>

<p>I loved your post, and im interested in reading the other comments...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. I&#39;ve often thought that religion itself may or may not be a form of mind control, but it definitely gets used that way by some people.</p>

<p>That itself is a profound thought as it implies that people were developing and using mind control techniques many thousands of years ago. So, ancient societies had advanced astronomical and geometric knowledge, plus they developed advanced forms of mind control. </p>

<p>That&#39;s something to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great perspective and really good points. I especially liked the point you made about wiping out Pagan religions adapting some of their ideology into current text. I&#39;ve read all of the Apocryphal texts, and believe a lot of them were inspired by the Gnostics. It&#39;s a shame a lot of their literature was destroyed, would have loved to read all of it, some of the gnostic literature that I have read is extremely interesting. Thanks for taking the time to reply in depth sir. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mom had never forced my brother and I into any specific ideas, and while we were growing up always assured us she would love us no matter who we were or what we believed in. Which helped me be an understanding individual, and tolerant of all people.</p>

<p>This didn&#39;t stop me from personally seeking out my own spirituality. Being in Florida growing up a lot of my friends were big Christians, mostly because their parents were. This involved me going to church on a periodic Sunday after getting invited by a friends mother. I joined a youth group because a lot of my friends were in one. </p>

<p>I suppose the first red flag was the idea that &quot;if you are not a christian, or question the bible you are damned to hell&quot;. This was a notion i could not get behind. Even though i enjoyed the peaceful community that seemed to exist; the idea of assimilation or eternal damnation didn&#39;t sit right. Eventually i would question the validity of Christianity, which was a big no-no, and found it wasn&#39;t for me.</p>

<p>Personal experience had left a bad taste in my mouth. There was also a lot of reports in the mainstream news at the time of rape allegations of little boys in the catholic church. Something to the tune of 3 billion was paid out in just California at the time. I know there was a difference from the organized religion i had gotten behind and Catholicism, but in my younger mind: they used the same book, and had a very similar discussion about god and spirituality. I thought: if men of god could get away with the molestation of young boys through the use of money; there is something very very wrong.</p>

<p>Through further experience in life, and drug induced deep conversations about spirituality with a lot of like minded people I&#39;ve come to have my own beliefs. Beliefs i feel comfortable with. Ideas that make me a good person. Not because a man in a robe tells me to every Sunday morning, but because I tell me to every time I  wake up. The actions i take are my own and faith in ones self is far greater then faith in someone who &quot;may or may not exist so why not believe in him anyway&quot;.</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m rambling on a bit. My point is yes. Yes i believe that our modern day theologies are a means of population control. Which is a shame. Because if there is a god, or a series of gods, or if you are the god, or we are living in or on a god; its not doing him, her or it any favors by manipulating the masses to either not believe or pay homage to the wrong things. It is good to be good, but why do you need a man in front of a podium telling you how god wants you to act? Being a good individual doesn&#39;t come from organized religion of the west... It comes from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post btw. Once I realized that hopelessness is the number one tool of deception I felt like I had almost freed my mind. In every main dis-info narrative the omnipotent nameless evil is unstoppable. This, like religious indoctrination, makes an individual feel powerless over their own destiny. The goal of the elite has been the same for millennia, weather by alchemy or corporation they seek immortality. But in reality the great hierarchical scheme is so frail they must blackmail all of their acolytes through rituals and invitations. The higher in the ladder a person climbs the more egregious their crimes become. Notice all of the rumors of pedophilia recently? This tool is their backdoor to easily discredited those who get in the way. What do you think OP? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with a non human explanation. I think what we&#39;re seeing is a group of skilled tradesmen (habiru/apiru) who worked for 2 advanced cultures(egyptians and sumerians) as builders and laborers. They absorbed some knowledge from both over time. The Egyptians probably helped steer their religious beliefs in a way that ensured that the pharaohs could exercise a reasonable amount of control over them while still giving them the illusion of freedom.</p>

<p>It most likely was a good system. What does humanity do with good things? We retain the concept and refine it over time. We borrow the best from other cultures and adapt it suit our own needs. Look at how often the term &quot;Best Practices&quot; gets thrown around in business today. Over time this system of theological control of skilled labor spread through contact with other cultures, namely the Romans and Greeks. From there it filtered through to Europe. </p>

<p>A lot of the mythology of both groups was retained , check out &quot;secrets in plain sight&quot; on you tube or the book Sacred Geometry by Stephen Skinner. Both show how much of the scientific knowledge was encoded and preserved through ritual and monuments.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re left with is two camps, the controllers(the dynastic families Royalty and old money) and the skilled laborers (hebrews, abrahamic faiths) and other versions of the same game in the form of Monarchies and caste systems. The leaders of the &quot;faithful&quot; laborers still get that kickback to keep the populace faithful. Look at the wealth of the vatican.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a brilliant system, most of us are just on the wrong side. You keep the labor at the correct ratio of faithful and fearful and they don&#39;t have time to see what&#39;s happening. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s changed? Information and education. The working class used to cling to faith and reject academia that&#39;s no longer the case. Rebellion and sedition once could be controlled and isolated.Telegrams, telephones, radio and now the internet put a stop to that. They&#39;re desperately trying to maintain that control and they&#39;re failing. Why is most media owned by a few corporations? Why are the police militarizing? Why do they keep trying control and censor the media? Because the only system they know is crumbling and they don&#39;t know what to do. </p>

<p>Beware of anything that attempts to manipulate you through fear or faith. Don&#39;t forget that they&#39;re just as fearful as you are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I liked your analysis. The only part i can differ is the non-human originations. But, thats kind of neither here nor there, because i believe that those who implicated religion are humans. The ones that passed it down and enslaved the rest were humans. I think its just that the stories of gods came from human civilization before the great flood, where nonhuman species lived amongst us. </p>

<p>After the flood, humans found the stories again and, whether they remembered the events or not, then turned the stories into an agenda piece known as religion. </p>

<p>But yea, overall i think i agree eith your points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t kill, don&#39;t sleep with your neighbors wife, be honest, I mean those are pretty good basic ideas right? I feel like that is a good starting point for reminding people to be good, I feel like the gesture or idea to remind people to be good started off with good intentions. Also I feel like those are general concepts that were around before the 10 commandments, how have made that theme rather popular. 
But the longer humans have their hands on something, the more we corrupt it. I&#39;m not a scholar or history buff, just my thoughts on it. And unfortunately I do feel some people need to be reminded to be good, I myself included. not that I&#39;m a bad guy, but like positive reinforcement on being moral. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt the the fundamental commandments were meant with goid intentions. But thats not population control. Those are directions on how to live a coexistent life. It wasnt meant to be used to dictate what you can or cannot do. </p>

<p>Universally, being good woukd require one to respect another, which means accepting them for who they are, not killing, no adultry, no stealing, no usury, no trespasses. </p>

<p>My point is that if you want to control anybody else, you are inherently taking away their freedom. That is evil. Commandments are often skewed to favor the authorities. &quot;Control the definition of words, and you control the people who use them.&quot; (Marriage, security, taxes, rights, legal, these words and their use illustrate that quote). This is evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic post! Have you read the Law of One? For what its worth Ra basically says the roots of all the major religions started with truth but were eventually warped by negative influence to spread negativity and control us. </p>

<p>Even a positive being like Moses was misled with the 10 commandments and because he was a positive being his influence carried more weight. </p>

<p>In my opinion the mother of all conspiracies is the manipulation of spirituality...</p>

<p>And yeah I think there has been negative ET influence for a very long time.</p>
