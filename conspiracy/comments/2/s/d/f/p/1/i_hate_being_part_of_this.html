       I hate being a part of the prison industrial complex. I hate that I have killed over a million people due to my lack of action. I hate every moment of it. I want it to stop so fucking badly. I'm so frustrated that America won't stop killing people, Americans or otherwise, in my name. Please. Just stop.

       There are men and women working in the shadows to guide us in a new direction. We are building our numbers and organizing.

       Whether you know it or not, you have already been recruited into our organization and will become a vital asset in Operation: Critical Mass.

       Your first mission as an Agent of the American People is to convince your friends and family that (1) 9/11 was an 'inside job' and (2) Democrats and Republicans are controlled by elite interests who do not have our best interests at heart.

       I have decided from now on to use it, or a variation of it, anytime I see racist remarks. I think either racism should be labeled as just that (Racism), or each race or group gets anti-(insert race/group here)-ism.

       I feel I should note I was referring to the Islamophobia that I notice is so prominent on Reddit in general lately, that doesn't seem to have nearly the attention other forms of bigotry get called out for.

       well, not everyone i've encountered goes that far down the bread crumb trail, but yeah, for anyone that looked into it even a smig, it's pretty obvious what country of orgiin the hijackers were from. I don't remember where it came from off the top, but the line this reminded me of was, "saudis hijacked planes and crashed them into the twin towers so therefore we declaired war on afganistan and iraq".

       me either. south park suggests the same, that they simply took advantage of the situation to seem all knowning and what not. This also reminds me of another story i read once. It was that in east germany, everyone thought the gustopo had a file on them. Turned out it was only like 10%. It seems likely to me that the nsa is working that same bluff of see all know all to this day.

       you say you feel distraught cause you arn't doing anything to stop them, but one man can do nothing. now when we come together as a community to make our slice of the pie a better place, then we have the ability to change the world. So chin up, and keep your moral compass on straight. If you let them get in your head like that, they kinda already won, and I am here to tell ya, though i know it looks back, the forces of darkness on this planet don't win.

       Don't listen to those other assholes, they don't really mean what they say, they just need the shell of "it's not me" in order to keep living relatively comfortably while our countries commit countless atrocities in the name of freedom and safety (always those two, often together).

       you are absolutely right to feel bad, you are absolutely right to feel guilt because IT IS YOU! just as much as it is me doing this. Now please stop whining and start thinking what you can do about it instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       You only have two options here. You can try to dull your conscience and your intellect with consumerism, TV, food, alcohol, drugs whatever or you can clear your conscience by trying to fix the stuff that makes you feel bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your choice
