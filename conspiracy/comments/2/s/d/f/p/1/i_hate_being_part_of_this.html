<p>Don&#39;t listen to those other assholes, they don&#39;t really mean what they say, they just need the shell of &quot;it&#39;s not me&quot; in order to keep living relatively comfortably while our countries commit countless atrocities in the name of freedom and safety (always those two, often together).</p>

<p>But IT IS US. We are the people who let this happen. We are the knowing doing nothing, just hoping that we won&#39;t be next.</p>

<p>you are absolutely right to feel bad, you are absolutely right to feel guilt because IT IS YOU! just as much as it is me doing this. Now please stop whining and start thinking what you can do about it instead. </p>

<p>You only have two options here. You can try to dull your conscience and your intellect with consumerism, TV, food, alcohol, drugs whatever or you can clear your conscience by trying to fix the stuff that makes you feel bad.</p>

<p>Your choice</p>
