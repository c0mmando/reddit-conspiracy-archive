<li><p>Satan represents evil. Enki wanted to protect humans, and give them knowledge, and to allow them prosperity.</p></li>
<li><p>Satan is the ruler of hell (the underworld). Enki was the ruler of southern africa (considered as the &quot;underworld&quot; at that time, as it was the world &quot;under&quot;, or south, of mesopotamia). </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you&#39;re right. The Old Testament and the Sumerian tablets are talking about the same thing. Not to mention the fact that Sumerians were first at everything, first written language, agriculture, government, schools, shipyards, you name it. Everything we use to describe civilization nowdays began with Sumer, a people who sprung out of nowhere, &quot;invented&quot; everything, then faded away to history.</p>

<p>The Old Testament itself seems to show a ruthless god as the god of the Jews. Even after they were freed from Babylon by Cyrus the Great, they remained loyal to their &quot;God&quot;. A sort of ancient Stockholm syndrome.</p>

<p>Thats an interesting notion, sir. Reminds me of the idea that humans, as a species, suffer from a collective amnesia due to the great flood. Whatever happened back then must have wiped out just about all of our antediluvial culture. What survived was burned during the crusades and at the library of alexandria and the council of nicea, and other book burning events. </p>

Eventually, in more modern times, they deciphered the original writing and found mathematics and schemes that, if not lost, would have pushed our entire civilization 100 years forward. Just that one book. So the burning of the Alexandria library was a catastrophe for our knowledge and understanding of the world around us, and plunged us right into the dark ages.</p>

<p>Exactly. And the library of alexandria had an estimated 100,000 books, if i recall correctly. One of the greatest crimes on humanity, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? I&#39;m to belive that Enki is an extraterrestrial being  in charge of a highly evolved civilization, genetically modified our genes so that they may see how th ey came to be. You know because they traversed the big bang and there over 13.7 billion years old. Hence why we meditate we can &quot;see&quot; the universe and communicate with these beings. But yeah there was a controversial issue regarding us as a species and a member of the civilization broke off from Enki&#39;s faction to stunt the evolutionary progress of us humans because he thought we weren&#39;t  worth it. This being created all Abrahamic religions and founded the most spiritually detrimental device even known to us. This device is called jehova. It&#39;s a though form that feeds off of the millions that feed it with prayers.  This being is called Micheal. Hence the references in texts from the bible.  I guess we won&#39;t know for real until we talk to these beings. Which I think is possible. Questions?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Questions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup. Whats this about 13.7 billion years?</p>

<p>Anyways, i wanted to mention thst i believe you are thinking of Enkis brother, Enlil, when referencing the being who didnt agree with Enki concerning humans. From what ive researched, Anu was the supreme ruler of the Annunaki, and had two sons. Enlil and Enki. He sent both of them to Earth. Enlil was the first born, so he had the rightful position of leader on earth. The Anunnaki had a problem, Enki offered a solution - Humans, which they called Adamu. So Enki went to what is now southern africa, and commaned the Anunnaki of the &quot;underworld&quot;, aka southern africa (compared to the upper world of mesopotamia), while Enlil stayed eith the Annunaki in mesopotamia. </p>

<p>Enki created the Adamu, after much trial and error, and became emotionally attached to his creation. So he wanted to teach them how to be intelligent beings rsther thsn <em>just</em> a slave species. This is whst concerned Enki, and created a war between the two. </p>

<p>Then, the great cstaclysm came (the grest flood) and just about destroyed all of the annunakis infrastructure. But Enki had told some of the adamu how to survive the flood, and live on. .. i think i digress...</p>

<p>Anyhow, the war was between Enki and Enlil, about whether it was a good idea to teach the adamu skills such as in astronomy, metallurgy, geology, mathematics, etc. (the tree of knowledge). I also read thst Enki wanted the humans to live for much longer (the annunaki lives a few thousand years) while enlil wanted the adamus lifespan capped at around 80yrs. (The tree of life). </p>

<p>Enlil didnt trust the adamu with these things. He thought thst the humans, being halfbreeds of &quot;wild&quot; earth creatures and the &quot;civilized&quot; annunaki, would eventuslly rise up against the annunaki amd over power them with sheer numbers, if they were allowed to havr the same knowledges as they did. </p>

<p>So enlil wanted to keep human devrlopment down, while enki wanted to help it prosper.</p>

<p>Anyhow, enlil won the war, i think, and i speculate thst hr then slandered his brothers intent and name and credibility, amd condemned his followers to remain on earth while the rest go back home to nibiru. These &quot;fallen angels&quot; became the watchers, i think (my memory is sketchy at this point). Anyhow, the abrshamic religions were then set up (now we are getting into my own speculstion) to view Enki as &quot;satan&quot; and Enlil as &quot;God.&quot; </p>

<p>So, thsts my summary, but im very interested in your &quot;prayer energy&quot; thing. How does thst supposedly work? And, as you say you believe we csn communicste with them, how do you suppose we do csn do thst?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the annuki goes I&#39;m not sure on that front how involved these beings are. To my knowledge Anu is a being that has evolved passed the gods to one day they hope to aquire that point of evolution. Prayer can be thought as energy. Energy is the stuff of magic that makes though reality and let&#39;s you be a person every day. More on the scientific field of study can be found here (my fav) <a href="http://www.journaloftheoretics.com">http://www.journaloftheoretics.com</a></p>

<p>He only notes prayer briefly because he know the impact it could have.. say you were to remove the jehova thought form being fed every day by people. It most likely cause physical reprocussions to everyone energetically connected to that thing. The guy in the link talks about how to measure this energy. Well its only a matter of time before they find this thing attached to so many people. And when they find out that their getting less energy than the rest of us and we tell them it&#39;s because of your &quot;beliefs&quot; they&#39;ll call us crazy and natural selection will do its work.</p>

<p>Communication is possible through 3 different kinds of sensory meditations and should only be done when ready. I believe I know the most powerful meditations to date taught by these beings to my peers and clergy. I&#39;m an Aqarian (yes it&#39;s a real religion) and we believe Enki and enki to be working together right now while the other real faction is in defeat, minding their wounds. Would you like me to source the meditations and site? </p>

<p>The meditations are a great way to get started on a spiritual path. There really powerful however AND SHOULD NOT BE DONE WHILST CUTRENTLY TAKING PHYSCIATRIC MEDICATIONS. Obviously I felt that particular part needed caps so take note of it. This path is not for all yet should be explored by many. </p>

<p>Now with their belief system, I don&#39;t know how privy you&#39;ll be to the whole idea that were a science experiment and we&#39;re working with our higher level brethren quite closly. Believe this about them though, they&#39;ll always say to question everything about anything. Your path is your own, I feel aquarianism is a sort of spiritual template.</p>

<p>Everything must be backed by science and expierance.</p>

<p>The universe is 13.7 billion years old according to the newest set of theory within pysics.. even though Steven hawking is coming up with a new theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man of course! This is the url to the main page is here <a href="http://www.enkiea.org/">http://www.enkiea.org/</a></p>

<p>The meditations are here <a href="http://www.enkiea.org/index/meditations">http://www.enkiea.org/index/meditations</a></p>

<p>They really encourage you to take it slow and meet self goals. </p>

<p>Yeah man meditation has helped me look at myself I never would have though possible in regards to how I forge my environment , it helps with repressed emotions and like I said you can communicate with others. My friends and I can speak telepathically when we meditate together. I don&#39;t like to talk astrally to entities because sometimes they don&#39;t leave, but if you know how to sheild this shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem. </p>

<p>Through meditations we believe scientifically we unlock certain genetic coding uneccecible otherwise. It&#39;s evolution. Read the front page see what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they were the same begin in diffrent persceptions. The sumerian text make it out to be like Satan was trying to be the good guy, though, and that&#39;s simply not the case. That&#39;s been his second greatest act, actually. First is convincing the world he and God and all that doesn&#39;t actually exist. That reality is nothing past what our senses tell us it is. If this trick doesn&#39;t work, then he tries to convince ppl that he is infact, the good guy. the angel of light. And in the end, it&#39;s all over the same issue. See, when God made us, he later stated how we can pretty much achieve whatever we set our collective to achieve. It&#39;s why he scattered the languages and what not. Satan can do nothing, and i can&#39;t state how important that is. All he can do is talk. His only creation are ideas, all of which are lies, designed to destroy. This is why he tempted mankind in the garden. He couldn&#39;t take on God, but he believes we can if we choose to. And that is what they&#39;re doing. They want to build a machine that can defeat God. And it will fail. Satan knows this, but from what I can decern from his actions, he doesn&#39;t give a shit. It&#39;s a &quot;if i&#39;m going down, i&#39;m taking as many of em with me as I can.&quot; Satan never wanted to protect us, infact he&#39;s been trying to kill us since the very beginning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alot o.o though i&#39;d be lying if i said i didn&#39;t wish to have a better understanding of the writings. At the same time, I have enough understanding of not only Sumerian, but several other anchient cultures and ppls to have developed my belief than from simple blind view or repeated bable. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before to a user I respect though not always agree with around here, mr. <a href="/u/ownnwonow">/u/ownnwonow</a>. My faith isn&#39;t up for debate, it&#39;s what it is. </p>

<p>Now that said, I can remain cordial and discus topics without forcing that belief, or demanding it, of others. </p>

<p>At the same time, all this still doesn&#39;t address the echo chamber happening on this topic around here (or in general on this sub for that matter). You either accept Sumerian writings are the only ligit source, or your looked at like a loon. Which, trust me, around here in these parts, i can appericate for the hypocracy alone =)</p>

<p>In the end, those writings are drawn from perception, and anyone&#39;s perception is as limited as our own. So while it&#39;s intresting to inspect the information others bring, you gotta remember that in the end, the person who brought it to you is merely as human as you are, and so therefore, should be scrutinized (spelling, my only weakness) not out of a desire to disprove, but to improve one&#39;s own understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>I just feel it relevant to elaborate on the purpose of this post. Yea, &quot;Satan&quot; is this evil guy, master of manipulation, etc. Etc.</p>

<p>Enki was by any definition benevolent. At least what ive read about him. But the striking similarities, and the old adage, &quot;history is writtrn by the victors&quot;, makes me wonder if Enki was slandered into this evil being because he disagreed with the ultimatums that Enlil was oppressively proclaiming. </p>

<p>Eventually Enki lost the war, so thst gave way to his name being turned into the most vile, evil entity imaginable.</p>

<p>In this scenario, it is conceivable that the <em>real</em> satan, he who pretends to be the light bringer, would be analogous to the Gods of the abrahamic religions. </p>

<p>Further speculation sees evidence in what atrocities are conducted &quot;in the name of God&quot;, and how evils are justified as the deeds of God. The God i always thought existed wouldve never commanded such behavior. So i always thought maybe, just maybe, this god everyone worships is actuslly satan, who has dupped the majority into thinking he is good, just as you described. Except for minor changes, i.e. instead of &quot;he tries to make people think hes good,&quot; its more like &quot;he has already manipulated everybody into thinking he is good.&quot;</p>

<p>The stories of ancient sumer kind of point towards this speculative narrative, imo. </p>

<p>I hope that cleared up what my aim was with this post. </p>

<p>Im not sure why youre getting dowvoted, btw, as i thought you had brought some decent perspective into light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i;m getting dved cause i brought a christian perspective. not that it&#39;s because it&#39;s christian mind ya, it&#39;s just that there are alot of ppl that attribute the actions of man to that of God, even though God had nothing to do with. </p>

<p>I actually agree with alot of what cha said, but i think we come to a fork in the road at the point of who is the heel and face in this situation. I personally believe, and have more than enough evidence though not just the word, but history herself, that Lucifier likes to play God. He wants that spot so bad, and he&#39;s done alot of work to where if you believe in anything, it will be to believe on him. Either that, or something else, nothing else, anything but God. That&#39;s the goal, the ultimate conclusion to the desire of his efforts in this war. </p>

<p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I isee what you&#39;re saying, that it could be revisionist history and God really isn&#39;t everything he makes himself out to be. I can precieve that point, but I can no accept it, because I know God is nothing but love, understanding, care, concern, patience, and truth. That there have been a great many that tried to convince ppl he was something more, less or else, but at the end of the day, those are fakers.</p>

<p>Jesus said to us, many would pretend to the be father, or a messenger of the father. So look at the work they do, and decide for yourself. Now don&#39;t judge, that&#39;s the Lord&#39;s privilage, but just because you don&#39;t judge someone to be condemed, or saved for that matter, doesn&#39;t make it so. It&#39;s a pointless endevor, thus we are asked not to take part in it.  Almost like Jesus was being nice in saying, &quot;hey, take care of yourself and trust shit works out right.&quot; </p>

<p>So now that i got my rant in and hopeful shined this light o mie, I will say, yes, spot on, Satan is pretending to be God, yes, he does infact convince ppl that they are doing &quot;good works&quot; in &quot;God&#39;s name&quot; all the while it&#39;s really just Satan, using ppl to make the world what he wishes to make it. Which is his kingdom, that he rules over us, and we all get to bask int he glory of him. That&#39;s because he thinks this is what God is about. And for all his age and knowledge, this proves just how outta touch with the real goals of God that Satan is. </p>

<p>So yes, I think Satan did a heck of a job convincing this world he&#39;s the top god,and ultimate good guy all the while being a d-bag. Meanwhile the true God creator is watching. And for those that are like, &quot;Well, he&#39;s not much a God if i gotta deal with x.&quot; Mother bleepers, God allows you free will, so you can decide who you love, who you hate. He doesn&#39;t control you. He doesn&#39;t want to control you, and that&#39;s why he rarely intervines. Not because he doesn&#39;t care, but because we&#39;re like children trying to learn to ride a bike, and he can&#39;t do that for us (well, he could, but it would defeat the point), we haveto learn how to do it. </p>

<p>Our purpose on this rock, is to learn to love. I know that sounds hippy, but it&#39;s also true.</p>

<p>I dont think its a secret that i am not religious. But nonetheless, i used to be. This line of yours highlights one of the issues i had as a kid when learning about my religion (i grew up as a baptist, btw.) Now, baptists arent as strict as catholics, but still. Therr are rules, regulations, and all that jazz that come with any organized religion. </p>

<p>The only commandments he has given us were the ten in the bible (from the christians point of view, though there certainly are similar teachings in ither denominations and faiths). Why must i follow all the extra rules? Those extra rules came from Man. </p>

<p>My spiritual journey has not ended in me being lost. I do not believe in the christian god, the islamic god, or the jewish god, or any already &quot;established&quot; gods. But i wont claim there is no god. As you said, the point is to love, and be happy. Nobody has to jump through hoops or blow themselves up to reach this goal. </p>

<p>So, ive since been bittter about organized religion as a whole. Which lead me to think, with such a negative viewpoint, how can these religions tout thst their god is meriful, when they kill in his name? When they muster all the evils they can to use for good? Its counterintuitive.</p>

<p>Of course, that is unless satan has commandeered the organized fashion of religions, named himself god, and gave his name to the real good guy. </p>

<p>Also, im fascinated with everything ancient sumerian, so i found these similarities and came to this topic. </p>

<p>I appreciate your religious point of view, however, (and ill say this politely) ill always disagree with religious dogma. </p>

<p>But from your religious point if view, is there anything you can say that might be indicitive of satans usurpation of organized religion, at least how it oresents itself today?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its pretty obvious Satan took over the church, and now, while alot of catholics are good ppl, it like another user and i were talkin yesterday, there&#39;s an inner circle, basically using that outer circle as a shield. Satan says he wants to be god. and look now at the pope, who can change docurine. A man, claiming the power &quot;refine and interuperate&quot; God&#39;s word. Now you don&#39;t have to share my belief in the same God, or my vision of him. Everyone has a perspective, so thier view will never be truely 100% same. The aposle books prove this pretty well. They all share alot of situations, but then in some, slight diffs, like how many times a cock crows. It&#39;s because they&#39;re writing as best they recall. No hidden agenda, but humans being human. But yeah, Satan took over the church, the church then ruled the world through the dark ages, and he couldn&#39;t have been happier. Then smart men were like, &quot;But wait, this isn&#39;t anything like what the bible says is how we should worship.&quot; Refromation brings the word to all, and now ppl don&#39;t have to take a priest&#39;s word for it, they can look it up themselves if they desire to do so. </p>

<p>So Satan came to steal kill and destory. He steals souls with his false doctorine, he kills ppl in wars in the name of God, which you know he has to be laughin about, cause he&#39;s literally getting ppl to do his work, thinking they&#39;re doing His work. Destoryer too, as those abombs showed when man puts his mind to it, we can certainly destroy. That&#39;s why he wants to control relgion, and he stands at the head of many of em, that ol serpant, the devil. He even has the muslims killin jews and vice versa, when in Moses&#39;s time, it was those very ppl that saved him in the desert and aided his return to Egypt. These two ppls look at themselves as cousins. Even in the Koran, it has verses that say, &quot;don&#39;t war with the ppl of the book, for they too worship Allah.&quot; that means Jews and Christains are not the enemy according to the Koran. But then, some stupid Holy Roman Empire came in and fucked that up nice. And who led that? The Emperor and Pope. That&#39;s why some muslims believe christainity and judaism to be of Satan, because Satan did and still does, hyjack the religion for his purposes, not His purposes. </p>

<p>Ya know, we&#39;ve been lied to for so long by so many, all for agendas, not of a benefit to anyone but the ones with the agenda.</p>

<p>Question everything! Even your own beliefs... Use Reason and think it through for yourself, not at the word of ANYONE else. </p>
