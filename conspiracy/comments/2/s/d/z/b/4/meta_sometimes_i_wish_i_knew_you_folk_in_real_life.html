This subreddit gives me a peace of mind knowing that I&#39;m not the only person that questions things that commonly go unscathed. When I meet somebody that has dabbled in stories about government coverups, secret occult messages, or unpopular political opinion, I instantly cherish the time I spend talking about something non-popculture related. We may not be a perfect community, but I appreciate the conversations we&#39;re able to stir up in here. Long live the truth seekers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts exactly man.  As a college student who awoke about a year ago, I&#39;ve struggled to relay my thoughts due to the tiny number of people who care to hear.  I used to bring conspiratorial ideas up around friends literally all the time, thinking that people just weren&#39;t aware and would be willing to listen.  I rarely discuss things like 9/11, MK-Ultra, etc, anymore because of how wrong I was.  It&#39;s not a matter of people not knowing, it&#39;s a matter of people not giving a f***, or not wanting to know at all.  I love this subreddit for that exact reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love the fact that not only do we have this community to pose questions and touch on certain topics, but journalists are more than willing to touch these topics too. The Snowden thing legitimized the need for a community dedicated to vetting the accepted narrative of things. I say, if these topics make people uncomfortable then fuck them. The world we live in is much too complex and interesting to go about life not asking questions or being around people who are scared to do so as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funnily enough, I was telling my mum that we&#39;re being fucked by the banks and our government the other day and she called me mad for thinking that. If you take a step back and look at the world pragmatically, it&#39;s insane.</p>

<ul>
<li>I get my information from books written by people on the front lines of this shit (John Perkins, James Rickards, etc.) rather than the corporate-controlled media, and my mum calls me mad.</li>
<li>There is so much evidence to suggest that the Holoco$t was at least exaggerated by a HUGE amount, yet we&#39;re called antisemites for questioning the official narrative.</li>
<li>Israel occupies a country, reduces it to rubble every couple of years, and kidnaps it&#39;s politicians and citizens, yet we&#39;re not allowed to question this either. Furthermore, expressing horror at seeing Palestinian children being blown up and melted with phosphorous is somehow antisemitic.</li>
<li>Terrorism in Syria is not only okay but supported by France, yet terrorism (albeit a false flag) in France is not okay.</li>
<li>The US overthrew the Ukrainian government yet have the temerity to place sanctions on Russia for their behaviour in Ukraine.</li>
<li>Tony Blair and George Bush are the biggest war criminals of the 21st century but apparently Putin is the real monster.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on. The fact that we can&#39;t talk about this kind of stuff in our society fucking baffles me. If we do reincarnate I think I&#39;ll be giving life on this planet a miss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll second that. This is one of the only subs where you can speak your mind about super controversial subjects and not get banned. However, these freedoms here make conspiracy an invitation for certain groups to try and hijack it. It is up to the users to down vote the truly hateful shit or the posts whose only purpose is to make conspiracy look bad. It&#39;s common sense. </p>

<p>There has been a big uptick on holocaust related posts lately. I&#39;m not saying this is bad. It&#39;s just an example the freedom of speech/belief  this sub holds to. We have users here who flat out deny the holocaust ever happened. Well, shit...it&#39;s their right to believe what they want. It&#39;s hard core conspiracy. If the user is offended, then they have the right to move on to a different thread.  This is probably the only sub on all of reddit where you can actually have a conversation about it. There are subs that cater specifically to that topic...but there is usually no discussion thread there. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the reason I joined reddit over seven years ago after digg fell apart. 9/11 and all things connected to it was and still is my main focus. Back then, people were calling us sick and demented for believing the WTC Towers came down because of Controlled Demolition. This was the only place I could talk about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, right back at you, friend.</p>

<p>Most regulars on this sub know the system is intentionally set up such that those who awaken are quickly ostracised by friends, family and coworkers. The masses are trained to get angry at those who question our collective enslavement.</p>

<p>The beauty is that too many people are waking up too quickly. Look at how much this sub has grown over the past twelve months. Look at shows like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCclKyWsEtyj2tIbczsB17-A">MaxResistance</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AustralianRoundtable">Australian Roundtable</a>.</p>

<p>The skeptic/&#39;truth&#39; community is growing at an exponential rate. Fast enough? Time will tell.</p>

<p>That being said, in recent years I&#39;ve seen conspiracy-lite views become more acceptable and frequently discussed without the standard social marginalization.  I&#39;ve even had some young pups try to wake me up with passionate speeches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what&#39;s funny... Most of my expat friends down here in Costa Rica know what&#39;s up. So we have a little dinner party and we all chat about all these great topics like Titanic/Olympic sinking, the birth certificate &quot;strawman&quot; deception, 9/11, Sandy Hook... and there&#39;s always this one guy who is clinging to the &quot;matrix&quot;, as it were. And <em>he</em> is the one who looks like a loon! Total role reversal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know who I wish I knew in real life?</p>

<p>Those miserable cunts over at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. You know why I don&#39;t? Because there isn&#39;t anyway that people that deluded actually exist. </p>

<p>Sure, I know plenty of people who don&#39;t like to talk about conspiracies, don&#39;t believe them, and may even argue about them from time to time. </p>

<p>But I have never in my life met a person whose <em>passion</em> it was to be the antithesis to a conspiracy theorist. Whose livelihood is so deeply rooted to this identity that they would deny even the most glaringly obvious of conspiracies. </p>

<p>That is the kind of person I would like to look in the eye. </p>

<p>Ps. You guys are cool though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likewise. When I click my reddit bookmark, it comes to this sub. I&#39;m also fortunate to know several people in my personal life who are on board with what&#39;s actually happening. We may differ a bit here and there on what we believe to be true, but we all agree shit&#39;s fucked and no democrat or republican are going to fix it. This is something that needs to be awakened in the cultural zeitgeist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government cover ups are pretty easy to talk about with friends who are otherwise open to discussing politics or current events.  You just have to ease them into the scale of what&#39;s happening, but that&#39;s possible to do with only verified information and direct evidence.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d almost argue that it&#39;s our responsibility to help our friends see and understand that the government is not working for citizens, but for the wealthy and in such a way that is often detrimental to the average joe.  </p>

<p>We can&#39;t make change without support! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree it is good to meet more people thru any means you can I dont think reddit is the best place. Some of the people I have got to know on here are different from the way they act on reddit. </p>

<p>They say they act like an asshole on reddit cause they dont want to get to know anyone via reddit because they hate people. Either that or are just trolls. Many people on reddit are of the victim mentality wanting to always blame someone else for all the troubles they have.</p>

<p>Even more are the jealous ones that blame you for things you have when you share pics of it and they accuse you of flaunting just to show off. I have encounter this in a sub i visit frequently.  I find it very sad someone would get shitty and dislike you for material possessions they can get by just putting fourth the effort.</p>

<p>So many people on reddit have the entitlement mentality as well. Its pathetic and so rampant on the user base. Its all a trade off I have found. The people here have a propensity for demanding a source rather then finding it themself. Then they will dissect whatever source you post.</p>

<p>If you decide to meet anyone on here op be ready to be disappointed.  Now find someone in your hobby of interest and its a bit more likely that you wont. Just be careful.</p>
