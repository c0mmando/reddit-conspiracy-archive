<p>Heirs to the Rockefeller family, which made its vast fortune from oil, are to sell investments in fossil fuels and reinvest in clean energy, reports say.</p>

<p>The Rockefeller Brothers Fund is joining a coalition of philanthropists pledging to rid themselves of more than $50bn (Â£31bn) in fossil fuel assets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oil was already falling by that time(not as much). Smart investors would know if oil falls some % in some period of time, and if you have 50 billion invested in this stuff you also have to know practically all information possible on anything that could affect oil prices. They knew about the oil sands and excess production and lack of demand, which caused them to sell their investments.</p>

<p>Also renewable energy has been getting more and more profitable. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if within the next 10-20 year oil will become a resource only used for specific things that need oil to run them(cars, ships, etc...) and most of the general energy production will come from renewable sources.</p>

<p>I doubt this is anything smart investors and consultants wouldn&#39;t have done themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an age old trick.  Famously done by the Rothschilds at Waterloo.  A famous, rich person(in this case Rockefellars), sell tons of stock.  Everyone then says &quot;The Rockefellars are so smart, they must know what&#39;s up, so i&#39;m gonna do what they do&quot;.  So people start selling more(driving the price further down).  Secretly, the Rockefellers(through agents) have been buying up the fossil fuel assets at this lower price(which is only low because people started selling like crazy, because they sold 50B dollars worth).  In reality the Rockefellars and friends have TRILLIONS in Fossil Fuels assets.  The 50Billion was just a market ploy to get the price to drop further.  Market Manipulators love HUGE market swings, because they mean HUGE profits.  How could the Rockefellars know oil isn&#39;t going to get phased out(and is actually going to skyrocket back over $100 a barrel), and demand isn&#39;t going to decrease?  Because they control when war will break out.  My bet is it&#39;s coming soon.  If the price of oil was really going down for good, you would see Qatar and Saudi Arabia panicking.  But they are obviously complicit(Saudis and Qataris are helping us kill their oil competition, which can&#39;t survive with oil prices this low, but the Saudis can for much longer, due to their stockpiles of Gold).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just what I think.  But let me ask you this.  Why do think the Rockefellars <strong>publicly</strong> announced the selling of 50 billion in fossil fuel assets?  The Rockefellars don&#39;t announce every trade they do.  This is because if you announce your trades, and other people mimic you, it limits your profits(if you are trying to sell, and everyone follows your lead, there will be nobody to buy).  So they announced this for a reason.  The effect of this announcement is(obviously) a devaluation of fossil fuel assets.  They wouldn&#39;t have alerted everybody of this trade if they were really getting out of fossil fuels and they planned to maximize their profit(which they always do).  The only logical way to profit off this announcement is if they knew oil was going to rebound(and they have proven they can drive the price of oil up... See Iraq invasion), and they were really not getting out of fossil fuels, but actually increasing their stake.  This is exactly what an intelligent person who wants to maximize profits at any cost would do if he knows a war is going to break out soon(or some other event that will drive oil prices high, like a disaster or collapse of the dollar, or lessening of oil production because of any reason).  Either the Rockefellars are stupid(and announced this for no reason, and hurt their profits), or they are smart(and announced this to effect the market, driving oil down, then buying it up at a low price, knowing it will rebound in the coming months).</p>

<p>There is also the positive effect this has on shutting down Oil exporting countries&#39; production(US. shale will suffer, tar sand oil(Venezuela) will suffer, Russia will suffer).  These shutdowns of production will make the oil even MORE valuable when it goes back up.  It also has Geo-political benefits for the US(Russia, Venezuela are &quot;enemies&quot;).  In the end, this is all to help oil companies keep a monopoly on the world oil supply, and limit production, to keep the oil price high(and their profits ridiculously lucrative).  Don&#39;t believe me, just watch.</p>

<p>No way oil prices are going to stay down for more than another couple of years either. As fracking operations stop producing, the oversupply should dry up and oil prices will eventually rise. Maybe keep an eye on things and see if the Rockefellers quietly try and reinvest just before that happens?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Advance knowledge? Lol it was plain obvious but no one has the cushion nor confidence to gamble against oil. You loosen shale regulation, giving western oil companies cushion to foot a lower gain on crude, and flood a market for God knows what reason. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much point in over analyzing medici gonna medici. The bet needs to pay off within the decade though before oil prices must reach their adjusted plateau again, so the question becomes can energy density per dollar beat crude in the next 5 years?</p>
