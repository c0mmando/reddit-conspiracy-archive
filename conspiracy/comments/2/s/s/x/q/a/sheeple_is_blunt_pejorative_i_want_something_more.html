        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think that a slur that implies ignorance rather than ineptitude... something that belies their victim-hood, rather than their stupidity.
I want a term that is slightly harsh, clever, and says, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m better than you... but you are living in a curable delusion, and I want to help you&quot;
It can be something slightly abstract, too... so they don&#39;t know the reference, immediately, and they have to look it up... a reference to Bernaise, or the experiment where they get people to shock others based on authority alone... anything like that.</p>

<p>Someone suggested &quot;Shildren&quot; - I like it, but it doesn&#39;t roll off the tongue. I like the phrase, &quot;wake up, shildren!!!&quot; Not clever enough.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to just insult people. I want to shock them awake. Bernaise himself would recommend this =P</p>

<p>EDIT*
Thank you for all the contributions and thoughts. After many talks, I find that I&#39;ve fallen into a mental trap. I do not seek a single term, because the people I am talking about are two distinct groups (at least). We have found it useful to use multiple, more specific terms.</p>

<p>Additionally, it would be useful to break up the term &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot;. Reddit is a fantastic tool for popularizing any meme, so let&#39;s create a meme that adds to the language and clarifies our discussions. Science classifies biology, stars and atoms... not to make fun of them, but to both understand them and have a common vernacular with which to communicate.</p>

<p>For example, it would be USEFUL to the discussion if we had nice neat compact terms for people who believe that:
Planes hit the buildings on 9/11. 
No Planes - Holograms</p>

<p>Or on method of initiating building collapse.
Position 1: Osama instructed a cell of terrorists to hijack 4 aluminum planes... with box cutters, and then pilot two of them into heavily insured, recently purchased, asbestos filled, twin steel concrete buildings which were designed to withstand plane impact. He planned on the initial fireball combusting enough office furniture to cause a blazing inferno which would weaken the frame of the whole building, which should collapse... and, it&#39;s gone. What&#39;s building 7?
Position 2: Professionals cleared out the offices on selected floors, removed security on the building, and proceeded to plant demolition explosives (thermite/thermate?) on the structure of the building. These explosives brought down the building... and building 7.
Position 3: A Beam Weapon!!!
Position 4: Agnostic.</p>

<p>And there are distinct, useful groups of researchers as to WHO did it, and WHY. Combo-question. There are very settled useful classifications, which we can use to raise the level of the conversation. We can introduce specific belief systems by popularizing a term.</p>

<p>We should create terms, so our discussions can be more fruitful. Ambiguity of terms is a primary device that people use to deceive. It is &quot;Doublespeak&quot;, and we can hedge against GROSS mis-categorization by forcing a precision of dialogue. &quot;You&#39;re a conspiracy theorist!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I&#39;m a Cabalist. Google it. We believe the world is run by elites, and that most major industries are dominated by this clique. It&#39;s very hard to pin down who is and is not in the circle of influence, but we do name names. We are specific. They control nations by lying... And they&#39;re very good at it.&quot;</p>

<p>In the absence of these precise categorizations... you&#39;re all just &quot;Truthers&quot;, and as long as you&#39;re all in that box they made for you, Piers Morgan can make you all out to be Judy Woods or Alex Jones, as it suits him, and ignorant are none the wiser.</p>

<p>I&#39;m redoing my post in more detail, later. Thank you, Reddit. 277,585 Free thinkers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Discoveries of any great moment in mathematics and other disciplines once they are discovered, are seen to be extremely simple and obvious, and make everybody, including their discoverer, appear foolish for not having discovered them before. It is all too often forgotten that the ancient symbol for pre-nascence of the world is a fool, and that of foolishness, being a divine state, is not a condition to be either proud or ashamed of.&quot; </p>

<p>When I talk about in the group, to be nice, I used to say, &quot;The mainstream&quot;... but that&#39;s MUCH less of an accurate description these days. I can&#39;t say, &quot;The average person&quot;, either, because that&#39;s becoming untrue, as well.</p>

<p>I want a way to refer to the group that is short, witty and not insulting... but accurate.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used the term, &quot;Sheeple&quot;, and everyone immediately knows who I&#39;m talking about... but it&#39;s pejorative. There is no non-childish label for the group that isn&#39;t verbose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too be specific, I don&#39;t think &quot;Dreamers&quot; is bad. It&#39;s very soft.
&quot;Uninitiated&quot; is condescending.
&quot;Shockers&quot; is specific and clever and kind of funny.
&quot;Bots&quot; is just awful.</p>

<p>The term, &quot;Cracker&quot; is similar. I get it... I&#39;m white, like a cracker =P. I get called a cracker about half a dozen times every time I get my truck fixed, and its never meant as a slight.</p>

<p>&quot;Capitalist&quot; and &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot; were both terms popularized by people who didn&#39;t like those groups, who discussed those groups using those terms. &quot;Capitalist&quot; was meant as a pejorative, but as a term, it is fairly accurate... it rolls off the tongue and so it stuck.</p>

<p>&quot;Proletariat&quot; was coined as a friendly term and &quot;Bourgeois&quot; as the enemy... but the Proletariat class never uses the term, while the Bourgeois class uses the term Bourgeois.</p>

<p>I once overheard, &quot;Your new friend does not have very bourgeois taste. Tell me, what does he dooooooo?&quot;</p>
