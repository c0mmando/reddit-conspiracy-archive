       Yes, the government will take advantage of tragic events for its own benefit. Clearly there is motive. But dear God, just because the government takes advantage of the situation doesn't mean that the government orchestrated it

       I am not saying that we are not capable. I am saying that EVERY SINGLE terrorist attack or mass shooting ends up being considered a conspiracy by some group of people. Even if the government spends a large amount of time planning and carrying out attacks, there would still be attacks that just occur naturally because humans are insane. Yet you cannot find a single attack that hasn't convinced 90% of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that it was a genuine conspiracy. There will be many more attacks in the future carried out by insane people, and every single one of them will be labeled as a conspiracy. Again, I'm not saying arguing that the government 100% does not ever do these things. I am instead arguing that CLEARLY conspiracy theorists are wrong about some events because there is no way that EVERY SINGLE event like this is carried out by a government. You can't be taken seriously if you are unwilling to allow that any of these attacks are simply the result of violent, insane people.

       Who's suggesting the IRA bombings were false flag? What about Lee Rigby? Madrid? Mumbai? I haven't heard anything about these.

       However, a large number of people are critical about the official narrative on the following :- 9/11, Sandy Hook and to a lesser extent, Charlie Hebdo. And deservedly so in my opinion.

       I have to agree but I myself understand the fascination of conspiracy theories. The fascination with thinking about the "what ifs." Its fun. No doubt. Almost anyone is capable of playing the amateur detective these days where information is so easily accessible via the Internet. But we have to be thorough and factual. This means we have to have evidence and
       <em>
        reasonble
       </em>
       doubt to back up what we say. That's the only way anyone will ever take us seriously. And we have to work together, bringing our ideas together in an organized manner, not just spewing out the next crazy thought that comes into our heads. I don't think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a good platform for this. Comments buried on top of comments, which are then buried on top of more comments. Its just noise. How can we fix this?

       If re-elected this year, Cameron has promised to introduce a “comprehensive piece of legislation” that would eliminate any place online where terrorists might be able to communicate without government knowledge. There should be “no means of communication” which “we cannot read,” he said, according to the BBC. “That is applied whether you are sending a letter, whether you are making a phone call, whether you are using a mobile phone, or whether you are using the Internet.”

       Civilization seems to teeter on the edge of wars and increased security. All they need is a little push (beheading videos, chemical attack, babies killed in incubators, hijackings, bombings) and their primitive instincts will overwhelm them as they clamor to find the answer and respond.

       Set the narrative. Then never let a crisis go to waste. Lie and facilitate it if you need to. Every death and crime that is committed will be jumped upon by different facets of the same sick beast: Money, power, and control. (They can be manifested from tragic events.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The EU jumping on internet regulation just shows how easily coerced they are from fear and/or take advantage of tragedies to push a controversial law.

"While I was there, I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns, and go into the room where ... babies were in incubators. They took the babies out of the incubators, took the incubators, and left the babies on the cold floor to die."

       Put yourself in their shoes. When you grow up in a elitist bloodline who controls major financial, banking, and military sectors and you've been sheltered from the 'peasants', given any possession you want, what's left? The only thing really is power and control. They're human like us—they want to progress and thrive and create a 'better' future for their descendants. They have a view of the world, a religion and personal politics that affect their decisions just like any human.  False flags have been a go-to move for centuries.

       I think you're wrong. Ive put myself in their shoes, ive ran the scenarios in my head and on paper. The endgame of power is pointless, they can, and do, achieve what they want without such a grand scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 wasn't a false flag. There was no benefit. Boston bombing, not a false flag. No benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The psychology ive uncovered is that conspiracy theorists want that drama. They want to feel thay sense of being Tom Hanks in the Davinci Code.
      </p>
      <p>
       People believe in Reptilians, the illuminati, aliens, gods, race supremacy, witches, ghosts, psychics, .. all from that same part of the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       admit it. If 9/11 never happend, you would be looking for something else to add that drama in your life.

      <p>
       Are you some sort of coincidence theorist?
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Massive snooping powers given to the Government in the Patriot Act. Unconstitutional and treasonous legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Trillions in profits for the military-industrial-congressional complex. President Eisenhower warned us.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Creation of Homeland Security, effectively a secret police force set up for abuse no different than the SS or Gestapo.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Israel benefited:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon, and the American struggle in Iraq," said Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Adding that these events "swung American public opinion in our favor."
        <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/mobile/report-netanyahu-says-9-11-terror-attacks-good-for-israel-1.244044">

        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Prime Minister Ehud Barak's narrative just hours after the attack being pumped through the BBC pinning the attack on bin laden before anyone else and describing his quest for war in the Middle East...how prophetic of him.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Coincidence? 5 men were arrested filming and celebrating the attacks on 9/11. The suspects were detained for months and failed lie detector tests while the FBI believed they were apart of Israeli intelligence [Mossad]. Former CIA chief in counterterrorism said some of the men's names were found in the intelligence database. According to the police report the driver of the van, Sivan Kurzberg, told the officers, "We are Israeli. We are not your problem. Your problems are our problems. The Palestinians are the problem."

       6) The officials in office at the time of 9/11 benefited:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         PRIOR TO 9/11
        </strong>
        —With its members in numerous key administrative positions, the PNAC exerted influence on high-level U.S. government officials in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and affected the Bush Administration's development of military and foreign policies, especially involving national security and the Iraq War.
        <strong>
         Section V of Rebuilding America's Defenses, entitled "Creating Tomorrow's Dominant Force", includes the sentence: "Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event––like a new Pearl Harbor"
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm on my phone, it's Saturday and I've got some things to do or else I'd give you some more coincidences/benefits of the 9-11-2001 false flag event.  Lumping reptilian, personal attacks, and red herrings into this convo isn't going to help anyone. Don't got time for that.  Gonna go grab some tacos and chill at the beach.

       I would argue that for the official theory of 9-11,
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of those that believe in it devoutly want that same "drama". They want to
       <del>
        know
       </del>
       believe that there are shittier people than them in the world that commit acts of terror, believe in "conspiracy theories" and "racial supremacy" so they can feel better about themselves for being "normal".
      </p>
      <p>
       They need an enemy to be demonized in order to justify their hatred of people in different situations than them, with different beliefs to them. This applies contextually to irrational hatred of "conspiracy theorists" under the passive-aggressive guise of 'satire'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on your "psychological findings", I think you've made an unfair blanket statement about people who don't trust the hierarchy of Government in varying degrees, which IMO is dangerous in a time when ours is so powerful. And that the traits you've attributed to "conspiracy theorists", can easily be applied to any group, homogenous or not.

       Do you think I hate conspiracy theorists? Do you think I trust the government? No to both.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe the government could possibly cooperate with itself long enough to pull of any grand conspiracies. Its all a game of stepping on eachothers heads. and throwing eachother under the bus. Not to mention the massive population of technology illiterate geriatrics that are in power.

       Something about your tone made it seem so, but my statement was less directed at you, more directed at the general "anti-conspiracy theorist" mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, you
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that, why is someone worse off for believing otherwise? We're all clearly a separate entity from those who hold the most influential positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear might be a strong word, I think they
       <em>
        wish
       </em>
       they were feared. However the key to a free people is that Government fears the power of it''s citizenry, and a citizenry is powerless when it's divided, which it very much is as of late.

       Just because a government tries to take advantage of a tragic event for its own benefit doesn't mean the government actually caused the event. I mean honestly, is there a single mass shooting or terrorist attack that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       doesn't think was a government conspiracy? Think about that. There's not a single event like this that isn't turned into a conspiracy. That's basically saying that no events like this take place outside of the governments Control. That's insane. Even if the government were orchestrating messed up stuff like this, there would still be some crazy mother fuckers who go out and do stuff like mass shootings and terrorism.

       Unrelated, but I came across talk of the latest ISIS production when I searched. That's another topic that's gotten almost no discussion and it may be the "fakest" yet.

      <p>
       Possibly - the question is, which religion?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I'm concerned, the Charlie Hebdo attack (non-Jewish victims) was an entirely separate incident from the kosher supermarket assault - the only apparent connection being that the latter
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       that he was supporting the perpetrators of the former.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposedly al Qaeda supported the Charlie Hebdo incident - and I'm finding that tough to swallow. There are too many "coincidences" involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       As always in these situations, you should ask yourself "who benefits"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Has the agenda of al Qaeda been advanced by this incident? Has the image of Muslims been enhanced, or has it been tarnished?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was this outcome not foreseeable?

The motives just aren't there, it doesn't make sense for anyone to deliberately make their religion or beliefs seem wrong or evil either.. the whole narrative is pretty stupid.

       not really, the rude cartoonists might have been seen as an easy target (compared to govt targets), but Islamic jihadists are not dumb enough to see them as the no.1 enemy of their faith/politics/lifestyles.

       Whilst the cartoonists wouldn't have been at the top of most hit lists, they were one of the easiest targets.

       But who knows, perhaps the cartoonists really struck a nerve with these nutjobs, putting them at the top of the list.

       Why do you treat them as a group with a single, unified ideology? Some dicks are willing to kill people that annoy them, others are willing to blow themselves up to send a message, others don't quite go that far.

       What does

       gain from a false flag? I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can be sure of is that nefarious entities have installed themselves into many intelligence agencies, judicial/executive/legislative branches of multiple governments and have promoted, prolonged and profited off the clashing of civilization. Prime example was the false flag of 9/11/2001.

       The populace should always be on alert for deception in the media, lies from their elected officials, and the propaganda being pumped 24/7 dividing us further.

      <p>
       Israel seems to benefit greatly from this attack. Along with the U.S. —whether they participated/facilitated the terrorists like in Gladio, Able Danger, Lavon affair, OKC, etc, is yet to be determined. The mainstream powers at the very least are using these attacks to advocate for their preplanned agenda.

       Mistakes happen because conspirators are human. It is the job of the media to ignore those mistakes. France was sending a warship that week to go fight ISIS. Terror attack before sending the carrier to fight ISIS preemptively marginalizes any anti-war protests that might occur. History of France and Syria goes back a while.

       Yes, historically. However even if the operation itself is executed as planned, it still depends on public opinion whether it was truly a success or not in the eyes of the conspirators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it should go without saying that the divide you speak of is likely exploited in order to subvert the entire conspiracy research community. It's my personal theory that one aspect (or side affect) of these operations is to create/exploit that divide, in order to silence anyone who questions Government behavior.

       I have no idea, I'm just answering your exact question. False flags happen throughout history and planning and executing them is not a cake-walk, the potential for fuck-ups is always there depending on the situation.

       Serious question.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are undoubtedly islamic elements in the world who want to attack the west. Cells plotting attacks are broken up constantly. Why not simply allow them to slip through the net than go to the effort of planning an absurdly complicated false flag attack? It would still achieve the same goals with none of the risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean every terrorist attack in the last 10 years has people shouting false flag. It doesn't make any fucking sense.

       You're partly right, i think. They always play a role as patsies. But they must be guided and controlled. Leaders are control freaks. Don't you think the whole gathering of the world's leaders for the anti-terror rally would have been the most dangerous, if parts of their movement could not be controlled? Think of the damage ...

       Yes. They are "created" by the FBI/CIA, and then, luckily they are caught by those same agencies!

       They create a "problem", and then proudly intervene with the "solution".  This way we are all aware of that problem we have with "terrorism" and appreciate our governement agencies for "keeping us safe".  We also totally acknowledge the need for these government agencies to "spy" on its citizens, they really need to watch those pesky terrorists.

       Never watched fox news in my life I am from the UK. Good straw man though. We have public records of the majority of terror arrests, including many well known islamists who have been hate preaching for decades. No doubt you will find some way to dismiss this, I don't expect you to actually use your brain.

       I suggest that many of the terror arrest are actually part of the plan you talked about above. They radicalize people and then capture them, but allow some to get through when its useful.

       Check out this study. Almost all terror arrests by the FBI are situations where they radicalized someone and then held their hand through the entire plan. They were never capable of pulling off an attack on their own.

       More likely they are drumming up support for the expansion of military operations into Syria, Jordan, and Iraq as part of the not-so-secret yet barely talked about "Yinon Plan" for a "Greater Israel". The plan dictates that the targeted regions must be destabilized. The massive anti-arab propaganda campaign is setting the tone for "justified" mass murder.

       Yes, yes, I see your point, but what I am saying is that they want the US to do their dirty work for them so that the people of the region hate the US and Christians and not Israel and the Jews, because the planes, bombs, tanks, and soldiers are US and not Israeli.

       When they got there to their target, the IDs were no longer needed. And maybe they wanted a more perfect martyrdom by quickly making their names known to their fellow jihadis. It's not outside the realm of possibility.

       One explanation would be that this is just wrong. The police just put it out their to hide that they had other sources. Just imaging the police had a source inside this terror cell: They can't just announce "Hey, the name of the guys is abc and edf" without giving away that they have some internal source. By planting the info about the ids they could hide such a thing.

       That's a fair point.  I still find it highly unlikely though, that they know IMMEDIATELY after the event who the perpetrators were, yet authorities could not take preemptive measures, exactly the same as 9/11 and Bin Laden being named within minutes after the attacks.

       Perhaps they heard rumours that sth is going to happen but they could not find them in time? Paris is a very large city and there are tons of places to hide.

       I have to ask - because I honestly don't know. How come that every time they ransack the presumed terrorists homes, they always have a flag hanging supporting ISIS or the taliban - and what not? Is there something in islam that promotes such iconography? It just seems too ... convenient, for the media narrative.

       I can't even talk with my co-workers about my thoughts on the Charlie Hebdo attack. Everyone I tried talking to about the IDs found in the car and the police commissioner who commited suicide thinks nothing of it. :(

       The police official who committed suicide was the commissioner of a town a few hundred miles away from Paris. By virtue of the size of the attack, every commissioner in France was automatically assigned to the case. He discovered his colleague dead the year and before and was known to have been depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attackers also left flags and molotov cocktails in the car. It's unlikely they were concerned about personal effects like ID's, because it was obvious they didn't plan on living through this. They told the police this in Danmartin, even releasing the sole hostage they had
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus : The door mirrors on the Citroen were chromed, which reflects light, which why they appear to change colour, when the car is at the 19th arrondissement, photographs taken from both sides of the car demonstrate this
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basic information and took only a few minutes to find
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are genuinely interested in the truth and details of the attack, then there's a large amount of information and sources available online
      </p>

       If you are interested in it being a conspiracy or false flag, then come here or go to conspiracy sites

       Thanks bro. What really upset me was the office bully (my supervisor) said that "Cops off themselves all the time. It's called stress my little man. Speaking of which, time for you to grow up." (I'm paraphrasing but that's more or less what he said to me)

       Thanks bro.  Yeah, he eavesdropped between me and my colleague when I said "But don't you think it's very odd that the police commissioner for that area off'd himself?"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's when he said (I'm paraphrasing now) "Why do you think it's strange? You're crazy, there's no conspiracy. Stop and grow up my little man."
      </p>
      <p>
       He's well known in the office to disassociate himself from anyone who is into any of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        into conspiracy theories
       </li>
       <li>
        into alternative homeopathic medicine
       </li>
       <li>
        into meditation/spirituality
       </li>
       <li>
        into reincarnation
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Well, anything that he doesn't consider "worth his time to talk about" (his own words, as he said it directly to my face in front of my other colleague in the cafeteria).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's okay though. I'll always keep to my standards, and will always question what I see/read/hear from the lame-stream-media.

       Cheers!

       The first hebdo video where three police run up to the intersection where the suspects car is parked has two cuts. The second cut is already mentioned in this thread, but i have not seen the first cut mentioned anywhere. In the first cut the police get bicycle(s) under them, which they use to ride away. I took some screenshots and made a post about it:

       Where does the government admit to carrying out the attacks?  We destroy their cities, we fund them and give them munitions, we feed them ideas of targets and methods.  It doesn't have to be a planned operation of theatre when intelligence agencies foment the occurrence based on a century of experience doing just that.

       Has anyone found the video of the kocher supermarket raid? I found a video on YouTube last week (removed within a day) that showed quite clearly the raid squad standing at the front door of the supermarket, throwing a flash grenade through the door when the shooter runs out with his gun hanging round his next, bangs off a wall and his hands flying up above his head quite visibly already bound together in either cable tie or speed cuffs.

Selective use of freeze frame to make it seem like the impact was in front of where it actually was + ignoring the effects of wind to be able to move smoke. Big Red Flag right here.

       The link shows that CNN were reporting on the scene off  the hostage situation on

       Look from this angle.  Uncensored video version of the last terrorist patsy Amedy Coulibaly being cut down in a hail of bullets running out of the entrance to the kosher supermarket. Police at each side of the door are also shooting in each others direction in this crossfire. Of course, only in a sloppy, staged, ridiculous scenario like this would the police themselves not have received multiple bullet wounds.

       It's a good thing hollow points tend not to go through their target then.

       It was certainly a dangerous as shit situation and not something the police would've anticipated. But given the point blank range, missing wasn't really that likely.

       You've hit the tip of the iceberg, but it goes way deeper than that. The mods are paid shills. They pretend to be interested in free thought and rational discussion because it's easier to direct the flow of public discourse that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked a question on here once and was banned for it. It wasn't rude, it was just a question doubting both the official story and the one being told on here, through paywalls and dead links.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question everything,
       <strong>
        especially
       </strong>
       what you read on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Because from what I've learned, the enemy of free thought loves the No True Scotsman Fallacy.

       Basic operation to get all Jews lamb to the promised land under the Zionist Terrorists. 
The Zionist Terrorist Apartheid Regime is the opposite of Judaism so basically it's another scam.
There will be more false flag and whatever it takes to bring the Jews back. 
If they stay they're screwed and if they leave they're screwed too.
The only stumbling block is Russia and China.
Good luck to us Goyims.

       And what happened to the woman who got away and was reportedly tracked by Turkish authorities all the way to the Syria border.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the Obama administration were wise not to attend the front of the unity march, because who knows what Isreal and Netanyahu might be capable of, beause word would have certainly run through the CIA to the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
       So add that to the list, that neither Obama nor Biden, nor Holder (who was in Paris at the time on security matters..) were intentionally NOT at the unity march, with Netanyahu leading the way and hand waving (talk about hypocrisy!).
      </p>

       Good on you internet for picking up on this so quickly, you don't get this kind of reporting on the "MSM" ha, that's a joke "mainstream media" more like irrelevant media.. we're onto you, and you're no longer relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do this one more time (MSM) and you're through.

        Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi?
       </a>
       ? and what was he photographed in meetings with John McCain?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that he's a secret Isreali double-agent trained in black op psyops.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why haven't they taken him out when the daily movement of all 30,000 of them is being monitored under the force matrix security grid that was once Iraq and Syria? Once they have a replacement guy i guess, then they'll take him out to make it all appear "congruent".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a push a psychological push all of it, on the very back of 9/11 and all those victims (numbering well over a milllion people dead) to perpetuate the war on terror and the rise of a radicalized Islam, in a controlled and "managed" psychological environment ie: fighting over there and all over the world, except Israel which has been repressing the Palestinian people forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Charlie Hebdo thing, was HUGE for a few days, their "new world order" once again solidified by the authority of protecting against "terror".
      </p>
      <p>
       And it does have all the hallmarks of an Israeli/French security operation or "false flag" attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man does the dark shadow government(s) of the world really piss me of.
      </p>
      <p>
       First 9/11 in the "9/11 era" and now these "lone wolf" ops, and the Baghdadi/ISIS op, this is not to say that people are not getting killed en mass and in some cases beheading of innocents, but notice how it's all being done and how it's being managed and depicted.
      </p>

       Rise of the conspiracy theorists where the terminology "conspiracy theory" is starting to lose it's pull.

       You're partly right, i think. They always play a role as patsies. But they must be guided and controlled. Leaders are control freaks. Don't you think the whole gathering of the world's leaders for the anti-terror rally would have been the most dangerous, if parts of their movement could not be controlled? Think of the damage ...

       One explanation would be that this is just wrong. The police just put it out their to hide that they had other sources. Just imaging the police had a source inside this terror cell: They can't just announce "Hey, the name of the guys is abc and edf" without giving away that they have some internal source. By planting the info about the ids they could hide such a thing.

       Yes. They are "created" by the FBI/CIA, and then, luckily they are caught by those same agencies!

       They create a "problem", and then proudly intervene with the "solution".  This way we are all aware of that problem we have with "terrorism" and appreciate our governement agencies for "keeping us safe".  We also totally acknowledge the need for these government agencies to "spy" on its citizens, they really need to watch those pesky terrorists.
