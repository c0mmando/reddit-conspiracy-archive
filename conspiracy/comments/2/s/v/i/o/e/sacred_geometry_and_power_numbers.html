        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Humanity is very much fixated on the number one, but little do most humans know, this is a lesser number to base our wisdom and understanding on. Individuality, money, words and their defined meanings, plus anything else that&#39;s part of this spiralling singularity that we call reality. <em>Under the influence</em> of one, you promote disunity; it&#39;s the lowest form of self, and thus against the family, the population and the World, in every format. A man is also part his mother and father, a man has multiple organs, and therefore a man is much more than a single thing. A man&#39;s hand contains millions of cells, each of which help form and keep it---the cells are a vital part of the hand and they harmonize in a specific way, above the number one. The number one is a singularity, there is no input or output; thus, the body is cubed, so we would measure it in cubits, which is mentioned in the bible, cubits as a measurement---it&#39;s also mentioned in the <strong>Theory of Cubic Time</strong>, which this thread is highly influenced by. It&#39;s cubed because the cells must fill a certain space, and this space must be compressed; in the case of the body, compression is with the skin. Take for example, your opposable thumb, the cells within pulsate toward the edges and then they recycle with oxygenated blood; this expansion requires the space to expand in, and like the space we move through freely, the thumb acts as the space of which blood can move through.</p>

<p>Space requires more than one to be; at least one meter, one mile, or one light year; so all of it together is not only &quot;space&quot;, but liberty as well; it&#39;s an environment. The body is an environment for cells and organs, and space is an environment for primarily stars and planets; but this is the very problem with the number one, there is no environment <em>under the influence</em> of one, there has to be a greater <strong>power number</strong> in order for things to find harmony. If there was one resource, one gender, or only a left side, then. in the first two cases, there would be no life. and in the third, no universe, because no freedom, or law, was between opposite or opposed parts; the resource, for example, an animal, would have no food and would die, the single gender would come to an end without reproduction and life would not continue, and the left side alone is impossible without a right side to accompany it, impossible to perceive, impossible to preserve, so the universe would cease to exist.</p>

<p>The universe is of cubits, microscopic and vast, in sizes; simple and complex in dimension and rhythm. The number four is the <strong>power number</strong> of the universe, it transcends one, it accounts for cycles, sensory data assimilated, and more. The why&#39;s cannot be explained with one, but they are explained in full with four. Take a good look at yourself in a mirror, or a picture of someone else, and sense their cubic nature, because without understanding of cubic truth, you are unwise, android-minded and destined for hell on Earth.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mother, Father, Son and Daughter.</p></li>
<li><p>Morning, Midday, Evening and Midnight.</p></li>
<li><p>Baby, Child, Parent and Grandparent.</p></li>
<li><p>Top and Bottom, Left and Right, Front and Back, and Inside and Outside.</p></li>
<li><p>Red, Blue, Yellow and Green.</p></li>
<li><p>Fire, Water, Air and Earth.</p></li>
<li><p>Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Examples of the number four in nature.</em></p>

<p>The number one also causes people to have an advantage over others; cases where they speak and think in the same language, allows crude interruptions in conversation or waves-of-thought to occur; people can distract others from recognizing cubic nature with people power and influence. Genetically induced temperaments and general evilness in people, that would be beneficent in an untouched natural world, is abstracted in man-made reality.</p>

<p>Any questions or debates? Trolls will be ignored unless they are good trolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Four is important, but it can only be explained metaphorically (meta-4-ically). It serves as the perfect frame for perception, like a picture, it&#39;s got four corners and you can see through it. If you worshipped only one corner, then you would be spiralling into an unknowing void. You would be cycloptic-minded because you have opposite eyes, that&#39;re both more than one, and they overlay when we sense vision. This proves that the number one is a lesser intelligence, for if it was true, then each eye would have it&#39;s own range of vision, rather than both focusing on a single view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I don&#39;t do drugs bar clonazepam and nitrazepam; and I don&#39;t drink alcohol, only water. I&#39;m very attuned with the number 4 and cubits, it&#39;s more than thinking as 4 as 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, or any other format in a base 10 numerical system. It&#39;s living and breathing 4. So words are 1-related, then we scrap words; we wouldn&#39;t anticipate the day as 24-hours, but instead, how long it takes... And so on... You are a bad troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they don&#39;t. Again, it&#39;s not about age, it&#39;s about metamorphosis; take for example, the baby who is born---this is a major point in it&#39;s metamorphosis. At the opposite end of the baby, we have a parent, who looks after the growing up side of the cycle (baby, child). A child, like a baby, is at the growth stage of life-metamorphosis, it is more capable than a baby, and it&#39;s closer to becoming a parent, therefore we select this as a major point. Finally, the grandparent---it may still be parenting, but it is aging, and unlikely to reproduce again, it&#39;s closer to death, the final major point. All transition stages can be mentioned but they wouldn&#39;t be major points.</p>
