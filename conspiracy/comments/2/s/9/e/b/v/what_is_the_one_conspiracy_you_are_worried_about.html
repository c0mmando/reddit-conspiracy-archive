<p>But to be completely honest. I&#39;m more worried that there is no conspiracy, I&#39;m worried that the world is doomed and falling apart simply because the human race is inherently corrupt and full of selfish greed that disables their ability to work together towards a common good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might like to look into Djinn or Demons. They&#39;re said to be made of smokeless fire. Lots like to associate them with germs but I find radiation to be more fitting especially being that angels are made of light. Radiation being a key part in helping drive DNA mutation is an interesting thought and could explain the hubris and nature of these beings. I&#39;ll try to find you a link but I&#39;ve heard astronauts see fairy like images in their eyes due to increased exposure to radiation! God knows best though, so it&#39;s might be best to just play with the idea if it can help you move on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m less afraid of true aliens because I think they&#39;d understand the true nature of the universe, us all being cleaved into existence from a small point of nothing, therefor sharing a common existence. </p>

<p>No problem.  It definitely seems like junk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honesty is its own deception. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I would say rather that lack of critical thinking and analysis is its own deception.  Honesty seems <em>always</em> a good thing as far as I can tell, as deception of any kind seems to take one further away from Truth, and the further away from Truth one gets, the easier it is for one to not grow, develop, and evolve properly.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

Thank God for what we hold on to, our identities constantly shifting, dying, rebirthing almost like reincarnation for every point in life worth remembering, it&#39;s a wonder we remember at all but we&#39;re constantly reminded. What a divine program! If it was a program, why do we all focus on the UI?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I reread through most of your comments here and will apologize as I might have jumped at what seemed to me that you were claiming God was human, which is a mistake and a mistake on my part to jump to that interpretation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m wary as you&#39;ve never mentioned evil and corruption which is society&#39;s and the people that run it today biggest issue. God perfected religion many times, the last perfect till the end of time. I just hope you&#39;re not going to claim we&#39;re all Gods, that claim has me rather jumpy being that I&#39;m hearing it everywhere nowadays. When evil is most apparent it seems almost appropriate, for those who hold themselves up to such heights, much like Satan, another of the Creators creations, to make such outrageous claims. God knows best though. Can you promise not to make such a claim? For those of us who read this who are like myself, wary of Gods punishment and hopeful for his mercy. Those of us who seem so few in numbers today.</p>

<p>Edit: if not, I&#39;ll just consider this that New Age Religious bullshit that the NWO just loves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are not all gods, we are all god. Imagine if you will the old 1980&#39;s plasma ball. Each finger that touches the outside of the globe is an absolute unique fingerprint and a completely unique soul of the one creator; that plasma link to the finger is the power source or animator of the body. Currently on this &quot;plasma globe&quot; earth there are 7 billion different identities of the creator here (may also be sub creators as well) but all ultimately stemming from one source. However we also have matter or material brain that is always trying to fight and become an identity or ego. So we are not all gods but we are all god playing the game of life throughout eternity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That argument of &quot;thats what the hebrews called him&quot; is erroneous. You are called what you are named at birth. Whats the first thing you do to get to know someone? you learn their name. Im not going to change my name if i go too china or another country. And i don&#39;t rename a chinese man when i meet him. So Jesus is especially technically wayy off. Iesous translated means man Zeus, so it is deffinately idolatry. And his name is Very Important for it is the name of salvation. Acts 4:12 There is no other name given under heaven among men which yee can be saved by. Even Baptize in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit. Baptize them in the name of Yahweh Elohim Yahshua. Not in water but submerge them in his name. Are you aware how many verses in the bible put STRONG emphisis in the power and importance of his name ? Even in Revelations it says &quot;in the end ever kneew shall bow and profess TO THE SATISFACTION OF YAHWEH the glory of Yahshua the messiah.&quot; So it doesn&#39;t matter what anyone thinks his name is or how people feel about the importance of his name. It simply what Yahweh has deemed the truth. Btw there&#39;s no J in hebrew or anyother language of that time up untill the 13th century. There was even a linguistic character that represented the &quot;ju&quot; sound! Want the &quot;true and accurate version of the truth&quot; of the bible (did you know its in the scripture that when someone &quot;recieves the true and acurate version of the truth they shall sin no more&quot;. So tell me everyone calling on jesus is sinning no more!! It always struck me off that almost everyone in church praying to Jesus never got an answered prayer. Check it out if you are earnest in &quot;proving all thing and holding fast to that which is good&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Especially when it says if you pray in his name your prayer SHALL be answered...Thats a gurantee not an if and or but. Its interesting that prayers used to be ended with a simple phrase &quot;certainly&quot; now the masonic alterations show through with &quot;Amen&quot; as in Amen-Ra..... Yeah the masons believe Moses a Master Mason and that he held regular lodge meetings at mnt sinai. The mason G even stands for GOD, which btw GAWD pernounced the same as GOD is an assirian diety going back to mystery religeons. The title Yahweh choose for himself is Elohim, denoting the divinity of the spirit and physical as one. Christianty is a concoction of the devil, Yahshua came to fulfill not to institue carnal ordinances like lords supper foot washing and water baptisims litterally and religion is of the devil because every religion requires carnal ordinance which by following is a statement of disbelief in Yahshua&#39;s purpose.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not understanding... The new testament was originally scribed in Greek with the name Ieosus, which phonetically sounds like Jesus. You&#39;re missing the entire point of the gospel by placing the emphasis on His name and not who He is. The Chinese people called God Shang Di, the Hebrews Yahweh or Yashuah, the greeks Ieosus, and the English Jesus Christ. The Messiah, Jesus Christ, Ieosus Christos, Yashuah Ha Maschiach (however you spell that)... it&#39;s the same person. He died on the cross to wipe away transgression and set the captives free. Our God is one. Jesus Christ is our Lord and savior, and it is only through Him we may be saved. He is the Lamb of God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its Egotistical to think you can say anything to them. Even scripture tells you that all you can do is earnestly contend with them the truth and if the spirit doesnt awaken within them what can you say? To christians that believe in creation i ask them where is their evidence to have faith? Faith not by what people believe it means but by how the scripture defines it is &quot;the evidence of things not yet to be seen and the substance of things hoped for&quot;. So I ask where is your evidence that GOD created everything. I have Evidence Yahweh did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im aware that you can&#39;t find anything written before 50AD. Tell me the letters of the apostles who were they written to and what language did they speak? Btw who he is IS HIS NAME, Yahshua is literally Yahweh&#39;s Salvation. I&#39;ll  put it simply like Elliyah did on the mnt &quot;If Yahshua be your savior follow him, if Jesus follow him.&quot; And what he said If Yahweh be your Elohim follow him, if Baal follow him&quot; Baal by the way being the hebrew word for Lord not the Hebrew storm god Ba-Al. So if you believe Jesus is the name then i say to you If Yahweh be Elohim Follow Him if the LORD follow him. And no im not missing the point because the point is to follow Yahweh is Spirit AND in TRUTH anything else is of the Devil.</p>
