      <p>
       Went with a few couples. My first time in a movie theater in years (just not interested in that sort of thing anymore, but wasn't going to turn down a chance to watch what I thought was going to be blatant propaganda and gauge my buddies reactions).
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought as far as general movie critique goes, it was very well done. Expect rewards and accolades. But that's not what I wanted to talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew there would be propaganda inserted in here, so of course I was
       <em>
        actively looking for it
       </em>
       . Even so, I thought it was incredibly well done (as far as being sneaky). Those who were watching this flick more passively probably didn't notice much of it, and I'm sure I missed some too.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I'm sure some of you realize by now, the way American style propaganda works is often very subtle, with undertones of how
       <em>
        the other side is propagandized
       </em>
       , and we are far above that type of behavior. So, instead of saying:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ZOMGBBQ Russia just invaded Ukraine!!!1one!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You can simply shape events or frame the narrative as such:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         Russian-backed
        </em>
        rebels in Crimea continue to resist Ukraine's
        <em>
         democratically elected government
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See how that's different, but still hits the same messaging? That's what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Diverging from the real life story, he joins the Navy not because of an earlier injury in his previous profession, but because of
       <em>
        terrorism
       </em>
       of US Embassies. He then trains to be a sniper, but then a brief scene of a plane flying into the Twin Towers, coupled with ominous tones, indicate to us and the audience that it is indeed that fateful Tuesday in September of 2001,
       <em>
        and we're off to war
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       To recap: we went from 9/11 -&gt; Iraq in about 4 minutes of screen time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also deviating from the Official Story™, his main sniper-antagonist at the climax of the film is not an Iraqi-Insurgent, but a
       <a href="http://images.fandango.com/r95.3/ImageRenderer/1040/650/redesign/areas/movie/moviesubpages/img/noimage_900x900.jpg/177733/images/masterrepository/fandango/177733/americansniper-mv-18.jpg">
        Syrian National
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting editorial choice, to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also omitted from the film is his post-military founding of
       <a href="http://www.thecraft.com/AboutUs.html">
        Craft International
       </a>
       , whose
       <a href="http://www.thecraft.com/craft_skull.html">
        Punisher Logo
       </a>
       came from their tour of Iraq, and the logo in the film slowly increases, which was interesting. They're logo should seem kind of
       <a href="https://willyloman.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/two-bags-2.jpg">
        familiar
       </a>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, there are a few great 'Murica quotes, like:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm fighting over there so we don't have to over here!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Would you like them in Seattle or St. Louis?!!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When his wife asks why he keeps going back.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in short, I think it's worth watching. If anything, just to see what everybody is being exposed to.

       that's your choice man.  however, that's also your arrogant and self serving choice.  feel free to enjoy your circle jerks and everyone telling you how smart you are.  i'm far from perfect, but still have plenty of insight that you lack.  just as you probably have insight that i lack.  the difference is that i don't think i'm better than you.  so, ignore away if it makes you happy.

       and i went through your comment history as well.  you sound like an intelligent, yet terribly lonely and sad individual.  i wish you no ill will just as you wish me no ill will, but perhaps your arrogant and condescending attitude could be partially to blame for your loneliness.  food for thought.  take care man.

       I liked(read: disgusted by, sarcasm) the opening shooter scene where the American sniper kills an arab Mother and her child/toddler, ostensibly because they were trying to kill the good duty-bound American patriots who were just trying to nicely invade and violently conquer their country &amp; civilization in between night raids on their villages in attack helicopters/invading arab's homes with guns in the middle of the night/dropping bombs on their cities/rolling tanks up their streets and firing them at their houses. I mean come on, what rational person would fight back against Operation Freedom or Operation enduring Freedom? Those muslims sure are some crazy terrrists!
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really understand how no one can see the obvious, simple, blatant truth of it, which is: "they're fighting back against us because we're fucking attacking them with millions of foreign fighters sent to their doorsteps and into their homes".. fucking IDIOTS I swear to god. The people in the future of America will probably look back at this point in history and be so ashamed of everyone in the army/navy/air force/marines/etc. who participate in and support these things and who somehow aren't able to realize they should not be acting in physical support of American deaths in needless wars, invasions, and occupations. The future, if there is one, will be ashamed of us all. We'll be part of that time period in history they look back on and shake their heads at how stupid we were acting and how dumb everyone seemed to be/how easily propagandized we were.

       That's pretty much how I feel too, but then I come on here and realize it's not that no one can see past the flag, it's more that the people I care about don't want to. There are plenty of us that can see, AD/veteran and civilian alike. It's just that what's worse than pure ignorance is the people that do are too apathetic to care.

       in my opinion it's more that they are trained from about the time they first start understanding language to link themselves and their perception
       <em>
        of
       </em>
       themselves
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       the propaganda, so "seeing past it" is not an option for them, because their sense of self is so closely tied to the bullshit that hurts them to begin with, but they don't know it because they are blinded by it on a personal/internal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone like Chris Kyle saw past the bullshit - who would he be then? He'd be a guy who was a murderer and participated in actions that got a bunch of his buddies killed for no/hollow reasons, and wasted his life on it all, though maybe he had some fun along the way, he couldn't hold on to anything and would have no sense of self worth anymore - so he(and people in his situation) CAN'T let themselves be 'deprogrammed'/'unhooked'. They rely on the propaganda to have a sense of self/self-worth/identity. Without it, they are no one, or they would feel that way until someone provides a new one for them, which I am going to attempt to do in a book or series of books some day, and that will be the thing that I leave for the planet to help people on their way to being something better for themselves &amp; others.

       No, I get what you're saying and I agree. By the way, I edited that sentence you quoted. Short story: I'm from a small town in the South, so I've seen first hand how "God and Country" play hand in fist to effectively brainwash us from birth. I've experienced it and even fell victim to it. Without telling my whole life story to complete strangers, when I was 14, I came out as an Agnostic Atheist. A belief I maintained until a couple of years ago. Agnostic Deist now, but besides the point. I was the asshole that took exception to standing up and reciting the pledge to "One nation under God.." Coming from a place where there are more Churches than gas stations, my idealistic shenanigans brought on a lot of hate from my peers, their parents, even my own family members. High School was hell for me, no pun intended. It was then that I could see that renouncing Jesus Christ (or all gods for that matter) to them was the same as saying I hate my country. Which was absolutely not the case at all. I used to be that prick that labeled other people as crazy. I used "conspiracy theorist" in a derogatory fashion. I would get so pissed off when people would bring up "Loose Change" or anything that hinted our government had anything to do with 9/11. I was just as cognitively dissonant about false flags being a reality as Christian Fundamentalist were about their God not being a reality. I ultimately ended up joining the military straight out of high school. It would be another three years before I could see past the flag. By then I had softened up to the information after my hypocrisy was pointed out to me. Started looking at it just as objectively as I had organized religion. Then I watched Libya unfold and the media campaign versus the reality. I saw in real time the manipulation. After that, I couldn't go back to the way I was. My identity WAS dependent on blind patriotism. My self worth was tied into how well and effectively I followed orders. I'm still not quite sure who I am anymore, but at least I was able to deprogram so I can be more than just another slave to my conditioning. Who knows what Chris Kyle would have become if he had enough time to deprogram. He may have lost it or he may have went on to be a great anti-war activist. Too many what ifs. Either way, I hope more people do deprogram.

       I was that person too, but for me it wasn't really about making a political or religious point, I was just curious about whether the adults would follow their own rules and I thought it was kind of a ridiculous practice to have all these children beginning every day by being instructed to stand and place their hands over their hearts and pledge allegiance to the state - that isn't what bothered me so much(the state part), it just fit into a system of 'ways of being' that made no sense to me and seemed to be pointless and a waste of human energy and life, so I didn't want to participate in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       my high school was less rural or 'christian/patriotic', so kids didn't really care on that level, but they just got this feeling that I noticed was like "he's not doing what we're all doing..and we're basing our sense of self on this stuff..wtf wtf what do we do" - so a teacher's aid/teacher tried to force me to stand up along with some other students she'd enlisted to help her, and I mean physically force me to stand up. Then the whole school of thousands of students got a letter home 'about the incident' urging them to 'be patriotic' and not participate IN 'not participating'(like I was). It was really strange and funny to me in how pointless all the things they cared about were, and how none of it really made any sense for any of them, and they didn't like what I was doing because it kind of made that real for them(the senselessness of it all), so they 'attacked'/tried to force me back 'into the fold'. It was eye-opening to me as a young teenager who was just following the rules as laid out for me in the 'student guidebook' for our school, just to see what would happen, and boy did I see! Lol.

       Yes, well that person you were
       <em>
        wasn't you
       </em>
       , it was "how you were being
       <em>
        in the absence of a real personally developed sense of self
       </em>
       " or a "real" context of life that you create for yourself based on your own understanding of yourself/life/the world. If you want to know who and what you really are, and who and what everyone else really is - we are all incarnations of the energy that 'is' and forms the everything in the whole universe(this large mass of energy which organizes itself into intelligent forms, like human beings, or to a lesser extent plant/animals/rock/etc - it's all this energy forming itself into "things") - this one big thing of energy has given itself the ability to express itself and it's own "life force"/intelligence
       <em>
        through FORM
       </em>
       . This form is created BY it, OF it, FROM it, and exists IN it - we are it - it is us - it makes us and we are experiential aspects of it living within the bodies made for itself by itself. We have the freedom to be/express ourselves/live the same way "it"(this energy that makes us) is free itself, we have it's characteristics only we are it expressed in form. One big piece of energy/aliveness(living energy, intelligent energy, whatever you would call what we really are dealing with here ..energy which has expressed itself in intelligent forms and creates things like 'human brains' out of itself to give itself individual forms). We are a big "one energy" free to do what it wants and what it wants right now is obviously to experience "life"/it's own aliveness in the form of "many" forms, hence lots of life and many planets to sustain it as well as an entire universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're here on this planet and we're all a part of the one "life" force of it which is this 'energy'(our words properly aren't all that adequate for the purposes of this explanation) expressing itself in form here. We are like the little leaves growing out of a tree, the tree is the energy that forms everything in the physical universe, we grow out of it and we are expressions of it's underlying nature and it's underlying characteristics. That's as far as logic will take us. We are it, you're here as an expression of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to rule people who think of themselves like this because this is an empowering point of view and perspective to live your life with - so the great philosophers of the ancient world may have figured all of this out, but it was not passed on to the "stupid" public, and they were instead given religions and institutions which would help organize them and direct their lives for the betterment of all(or for the betterment of the few, depending on who was ruling at the time). You were in one of those institutions and you have or are now separating yourself from your "programming" which was meant to switch your personal identity from "big/empowered" to "small/disempowered unless following orders or playing 'follow the leader' in some other way"(whether in the military or in churches or in 'normal' society').
      </p>
      <p>
       You're free now dude, and you're an expression of "the universe"(or rather the energy which has created the whole material universe out of itself giving itself chances to express it's own 'life force' through a world of form and matter formed out of it's obviously intelligently-organized energy). So I guess it's good that you're already 'agnostic deist' because this would fit right into that. Make your life about things that help you and help other people see the good things that you know, and your identity can be a very powerful/empowering one. Keep figuring things out for yourself, the truth is good when you find it - even if the state of the world OUT of sight of the truth isn't that good right now.

       Thanks, man! I just had my girlfriend read your comment and she goes, "This sounds like something you would say. It sounds like you're responding to yourself." So, I've been on about the same plane of thinking, you're just a bit more confident in it than I am. I've been thinking of it as more of a
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        what if

       than a fundamental truth. That's part of the reason I amended my belief. My whole thing is just the whole "who am I" within the greater context of "what WE are". So, thanks for kinda reaffirming.

       Well that's cool, and you're welcome I'm glad you liked it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if it helps any I think "who you are" within the greater context is something that is
       <em>
        inherent within you
       </em>
       and simply your true nature as a person - you will find it out or figure it out eventually, but you already "are" being it(whatever you really are), because that's what who you "really are" means - it's just who you really are internally and the basis/foundation of your whole being. I think it's probably something like "we" as individuals are all unique/individual expressions of a particular aspect of/characteristic of/idea within the mind of this greater one "beingness" of the energy that forms all things out of itself - it's expressing itself through us, the sum of all it's part expressed individually rather than simply remaining as aspects of 'the one thing' - and coming back together again(which would be the point of life on this carousel we're all on)..
      </p>
      <p>
       ..rather than being something you need to "decide" or "make". I think you just already 'are' and the process of finding that out/figuring out 'who you are' is one of discovery rather than creating - and you're already well on your way to that now that you've unhooked from the 'false self' created for you by the culture we were born into to HIDE who you really are from you and which is there to try to keep you from realizing it.

        Went with a few couples. My first time in a movie theater in years (just not interested in that sort of thing anymore, but wasn't going to turn down a chance to watch what I thought was going to be blatant propaganda and gauge my buddies reactions).

       Ha, I'm not the only one! I actually haven't paid to go to the movies since like 2009? I've been to a few free presentations, but something totally creeps me out about going to theaters anymore, and it's not just the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I like watching other people watch obvious propaganda. I don't quite understand it, but some kind of switch flipped in me, to where I'm removed from being immersed in media anymore. That's not to say I'm not moved at times by songs, scenes, etc. But there's a questioning internal dialogue now.
      </p>

       Watching an ex watch Despicable Me II was fucking uncomfortable. (I mean, wtf, a children's movie titled that is disturbing enough...)  He was utterly glued to the screen, laughing in this very primal way. It was like hypnosis. I also had the thought of how many American eyeballs were glued to screens in the same way, just watching watching watching, without any thought.

       I caught myself looking around often at everyone else. At the risk of sounding super cliché, it felt like being in The Matrix, but knowing you are in The Matrix. Apologies again for the lame reference.

       The audience actually applauded at the obvious climax of the film, it was really bizarre. I also heard one of the GFs I was with say:

       ..which hammered home the point I guess. Now don't get me wrong, I love hugs, but it was just the perfect encapsulation of what Lionsgate and Columbia pictures was going for.

       I found the movie to be tawdry and blatantly inauthentic. The movie sensationalized and falsifies certain aspects of Chis Kyle's book so as to embellish the emotional aspect of war and a man supposedly fighting for what he thinks is just.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found this movie subtly jingoistic and it never once depicted Chris Kyle as a man addicted to killing. Hell, he even boasted about his kills, and thought that Iraqi people were savages. He's been quoted saying, "ill kill anyone who wears a turban."
      </p>
      <p>
       In his book he claimed to kill looters during Hurricane Katrina. He lied about quite a few things actually. But...just the fact that he pretended to kill civilians after the hurricane down in New Orleans, doesn't speak highly of this man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the real Chris Kyle is a sadist who openly says that he enjoys killing. This movie is a whitewash of one of the most brutal chapters in American military history, an attempt to pretend this guy, a symbol of the sick brutality of our occupations of other countries, and pretend that he is some normal guy, struggling against the emotional baggage of being a pro killer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movie also does not have a conceivable storyline. In this movie the war is glorified through a fallacious vantage point. There is no gray area in the depiction. This is imprudent and ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the movies plot was disjointed, the acting excluding Bradley Cooper was sub par, especially from the wife. The photography and frames were inconsistent, and the CGI was absolutely appalling and looked to be a video game at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wartime / back at home flip-flop approach feels sort of modular and clunky and at times confusing. Also, the respites were quite redundant with Chris Kyle's wife and at times inauthentic, especially during a seemingly pivotal scene in the movie where a stage baby is used. This alone shows laziness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the script was so terrible, I actually thought a 12 year old wrote it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, I had high expectations for this movie and it quite literally felt like I was watching a propaganda film. I expected better from Clint.

       Bear in mind that Eastwood is at best a second rate hack in the model of Ronald Reagan. Neither could act. Both were propagandists in perpetuating the myth of the rugged individualist and projecting might makes right. Hopefully, one day soon America will close the Hollywood chapter on the propaganda that was the Western film era and acknowledge that our culture has been built upon genocide and truly disgraceful "heroes".

       Do note how the sniper is a victim and deserves our sympathy. His victims are hurting him and he is oh so conflicted but patriotism is the writhing pot of twist-o-logic that makes it all possible. Kiss the killer, hug him, he's hurting. The mongers keep feeding, we keep lapping it up. Sadly we only increase the numbers of those who consider themselves "american snipers" as in, those who kill americans.

       I have no idea if this specific movie received funding or material support from the military, but this is a common occurrence. As long as you give them access to edit the scripts of war movies, the Film Liaison Office at the Pentagon will be happy to provide tanks, planes, etc for your badass, now completely pro-American war movies.

        Look at how much this article alone contradicts the movie.
       </a>
       The thing that gets me, is the first time I realized Chris Kyle even existed was due to his pro-gun/2nd Amendment comments. Obviously the release of his book, which the movie is based on, thrust him into the initial spotlight. But, as the gun debate kept getting so much coverage due to the number of highly publicized shootings (Aurora, Sikh Temple, Oregon Mall, etc), he remained relevant as a dissenting voice. Especially, when I was still on Facebook and the FBP "Uncle Sam's Misguided Children" had (probably still do have) a huge hard-on for any opinion he was willing to share on the 2nd Amendment, Obama, Liberals, etc. Among veterans, when he spoke, many listened. Then Sandy Hook happened shortly after the Oregon Mall Shooting, and I remember it being Chris Kyle overload on Facebook. I'm not insinuating anything at this point, but about 2 weeks before his death he had conducted an
       <a href="http://youtu.be/llLVMUlDpaE">
        interview
       </a>
       featured on
       <a href="http://www.guns.com//">
        guns.com
       </a>
       's YT, that I remember being a big deal at the time. He was (his wife has) releasing a second book called "
       <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/chris-kyles-wife-speaks-for-his-book-and-for-guns">
        American Gun
       </a>
       ", said to be a historical recap on gun culture in America as well as personal tales of how guns had an impact on his life. So, the thing that really gets me is none of these things are even a passing footnote in the last few minutes of the movie. Not even the fact he was writing a book or the already mentioned founding of CRAFT Intl.

       This article sheds light on some of Chris Kyle's lies:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       OTOH, as for his death, I question the wisdom of taking a vet with a bad case of PTSD (and who apparently you've never met before) to a
       <strong>
        SHOOTING RANGE
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, fuck, I'm no psychologist, but doesn't PTSD bury "triggers" in the patient which cause them to react unpredictably? didn't he learn anything from his little accident with the dog in the party scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the problem is that Chris Kyle gave that decision the same depth of thought that he gave the rest of his killing career. We good, them bad.

       Interesting - especially given that the whole Ukraine business conveniently popped up to distract Putin's attention from Syria, where he was causing major problems with Netanyahu/Obama's schemes to frame Assad for the Sarin gas attacks.

       Was the Syrian painted as an Assad supporter?

       The movie is very well done. Clint Eastwood knows how to put together an entertaining movie. That's being said, it is propaganda from start to finish.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movie never shows Kyle making a mistake and killing an innocent person. What are the chances of that? He claimed to have, what? Around 150 kills. Some of them had to be complete innocents. My guess, about 60% of the people he killed were completely innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the whole Jesse Ventura story, which was not even touched on in the movie. Kyle was proven in a court of law to be a liar who tried to defame Ventura. Apparently, Kyle has told other outrageous lies. If he's such a conpulsive liar, why should we believe anything he says about his "kills" as a sniper?
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that fascinated me most about Kyle is the way he was killed. I'm convinced it was a hit. Who ordered it, I don't know, but the whole things stinks to high heaven. Shot by shooting partner, at a gun range, when nobody else is around to see what happened? Yeah, sure. He was executed by the Seals or the CIA for something he did, or was about to do. I like to think he was killed for trashing Ventura's reputation, because that would be justice of sorts.

       i do not agree with you, i think the idea of war (mostly in young people) is way more romantic than this and i bet many guys are NOT going to join the military after watching this
      </p>
      <p>
       Why i would like to have PSTD while everybody else is just care free back in the USA, why i have to kill kids and carry that in my mind everyday, while other people drive cars or have regular jobs

       on the other hand, the logo did catch my attention in the movie

       PD someone can confirm if the part of the 9/11 news that show is the famous part where the anchor man is saying something along the "looks like explosives where in the understructure of the WTC"? I will have to watch it again

       It was not. I believe Dan Rather was the one who initially stated that line, and it definitely wasn't Dan Rather's voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like they just cobbled the idea together and had a news anchor state it as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your other points are valid, however, and I really hope the target demo (18-24 year olds) really are considering the ramifications of military service to go off and fight these boogeymen.

       i imagine you're being sarcastic, but seriously, the post is just painfully obvious.  a war movie glorified war and changed the story to make money.  i just don't see what exactly was uncovered here.
      </p>
      <p>
       the iraq war was a farce and chris kyle was a murdering psychopath.  no doubt about it.  however, the book is worth a read and i'm kind of tired of everyone seeing a 90 minute flick and then being an expert on his story.

       Bear in mind that Eastwood is at best a second rate hack in the model of Ronald Reagan. Neither could act. Both were propagandists in perpetuating the myth of the rugged individualist and projecting might makes right. Hopefully, one day soon America will close the Hollywood chapter on the propaganda that was the Western film era and acknowledge that our culture has been built upon genocide and truly disgraceful "heroes".
