        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Honestly, especially with this movie &quot;American Sniper&quot; coming out. The only reason I could see behind having this movie is trying to deter people from joining the military. When I see a movie trailer like that all I can think of is, &quot;Wow, I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not in the military since I don&#39;t have to deal with all of those excruciating after-effects and paranoia.&quot; But then I looked back into all sorts of war movies. Almost all of them try to tell us to beef up our military so that we&#39;ll be more protected. I guess I just started noticing subliminal messaging... more.</p>

<p><strong>TL/DR</strong> When Top Gun came out, they had navy recruitment right there in the theatre.  Zero Dark Thirty for example.</p>

<p>Edit:Spelling, and  I just saw a comment of &quot;Taken 3&quot; on the home page and only reminded me that during the car scenes:
A jeep was coincidentally kicking all of the foreign jeep-esq vehicles ass (mitsubishi, nissan, suzuki) also with a car chase of him driving an audi doing those ridiculous drifts and what-not outrunning subarus, mazdas, etc.</p>

This happened to the film The Green Zone, and it didn&#39;t fare well at the box office*.  Another film it happened to iirc was Apocalypse Now, and Coppola had to go to the Philippines and use Philippine helicopters and such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That article seems to have nothing to do with what we&#39;re talking about or the CIA, it just says that the creative side of Hollywood has a liberal bias - no shit, pretty much every creative industry (music, art, etc..) has a liberal bias, as artists, musicians and many writers tend to be liberals.</p>

<p>The bit about authors having books written by the CIA is interesting though, any sources?  I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re talking about authors such as Tom Clancy, that have a military bent?  (The CIA tends to swing to the Right with a heavy pro-military stance.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, there&#39;s no doubt Clancy had CIA connections, I mean the press even openly hinted about/reported it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Langley was equally helpful to the novelist Tom Clancy, who was invited to CIA headquarters after the publication of The Hunt for Red October, an invitation that was regularly repeated. Consequently, when Clancy&#39;s The Sum of All Fears was filmed in 2002, the agency was happy to bring its makers to Langley for a personal tour of headquarters, and to offer access to agency analysts for star Ben Affleck.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the CIA actively wrote his stuff, though they&#39;re basically admitting they consulted on details.  I&#39;m curious what other authors he&#39;s also referring to.</p>

<p>Prior to each surgery, with the patient?  Cuz that would then be a major flaw in Grey&#39;s Anatomy.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t doubt thats important in a big picture sense, but nothing I&#39;ve ever seen or heard would lead me to believe that surgeons are just like highly skilled waiters always looking out for the next expensive surgery.</p>

<p>How so?  A quick googling would lead me to believe that most surgeons are paid a salary.  Or is it a big picture thing like they consult w/ the surgeons to find out how much personnel/materials are required and that sort of stuff so estimates or whatever can be made? (serious question)</p>

<p>I am not making up the fact that out of all the episodes the topic is never discussed on normal terms. In America the cost of even the simplest procedure is often outrageous. In the shows they may discuss one or two interesting situations where brain surgery might break the bank and they maybe try to raise money in some way. They save the topic for outrageously expensive situations where the viewer wont see it as a systemic problem with the health care industry.</p>

<p>Its not indicative of the reality being that even the kid showing up with a bruised knee is potentially being hit for 5 grand in costs simply because he was brought in with an ambulance. They dont talk about that stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. They trick the viewer by first showing the heinous action of the accused. So you want them to be caught at all costs. When you then see the cops break the rules you then justify it for them without them telling you explicitly you should.</p>

<p>This is on top of the fear being pounded into your brain that bad guys are everywhere. Then you are told they are so bad we should stop at nothing to get them, with subtle hints that they are restricted by the pesky Constitution.</p>

<p>The great irony of our system is that for most higher state offices, most states have laws that disallow felons from running, but go read the Constitution...you can be a convicted serial killer and still run for and even be allowed under law to win the Presidency or Congress as long as you meet the age and residency requirements. </p>

<p>&quot;In a flashback in Hiatus Part 1 (episode), it was revealed that Gibbs after discovering a folder on Hernandez headed to Mexico. In his grief-stricken state and consumed by nothing but a strong, overwhelming desire for revenge against the man who had robbed him of his family, Gibbs killed Hernandez by shooting the other man through the windscreen of his truck with a single sniper shot, the impact of which killed Hernandez instantly and even caused blood to appear on the windscreen. Gibbs later returned to the U.S where he kept the crime concealed for twenty years.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That story doesn&#39;t even bother me.  That was Gibbs, one of the show&#39;s agents, acting on his own accord.  I think that is a reflection from the Western genre where the hero&#39;s vigilantism is accepted since it is the only way to achieve justice in that situation.  It&#39;s different when the officials of the land are not bound by the laws of the land.  Which is the message when we see on-duty officers of the law taking liberties with the law.  That&#39;s what concerns me.</p>

<p>TV tropes is probably a better place than here to look for it, but there is a definite &#39;stereotype&#39; of the bad/crooked good guy cop.  If we wanted to get all brainwashy/conspiracy here, I don&#39;t think its unreasonable to think that the people making these shows <strong>know</strong> that their viewers know that not all cops are good, so blindly making every cop a perfect good guy wouldn&#39;t as much for police public image.  They have to have a more nuanced trope to assure us that even the bad cops are good.</p>

<p>edit: I&#39;ve been watching Dexter lately so I&#39;ll pull another example from there, but Quinn is an obvious crooked good guy cop there.</p>

I think there are probably more that will simply follow orders from higher ups, less that just go off of their experience, and even fewer that are actually trying to get justice for the victims, which I think are truly good cops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t watch any of the other Law and Orders or CSI so I can&#39;t speak for them but I think SVU shows that all cops are deeper than the stuff that you see on the streets. There have been episodes that show dirty cops and Chester Lake, one of Ice-T&#39;s past partners, ended up going to prison for killing another cop. There have been appearances of actors playing cops that were very obviously bad, inadequate, or dirty cops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, its not my beef and I&#39;m not prepared to properly explain it.</p>

<p>But I (used to) know more people than I suspect is normal who were very souther pride etc etc.  They hated Lincoln with a fiery passion and would go on at length about him.</p>

<p>Unfair taxation of southern goods was a big one, supposedly, and displeasure with the level of autonomy allowed in the supposed &#39;union&#39; of individual states - decisions (not about slavery) being made at a national level where southern states would have preferred their own way.  </p>

<p>I think the bit in the movie he talks about though was how, while they technically had the legal right to secede from the union, he couldn&#39;t order the armies against them if he recognized their sovereignty as it would require the approval of congress, which he would never get because half of fuckin congress was trying to leave the party anyway.  So he ignores their legal right to secede, declares war illegally, and orders the military to secure the south.</p>

<p>My beef though, is how &quot;ITS ALL ABOUT FREEING THE SLAVES&quot; is hammered throughout the movie, when in reality, Lincoln only freed the slaves <em>in the south</em>.  I doubt even that would have happened if the war had gone better.  We were a country with a long tradition of slavery and we didn&#39;t just develop a conscience overnight.</p>

<p>&quot;no expense is ever incurred by the government or taxpayers. Servicemembers who serve as extras are on leave and are paid by the production company, as are crews who fly the aircraft.&quot;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t like me because I&#39;m not a sheep in your flock.  I say things you don&#39;t agree with and the majority of you reply with raging insults and personal attacks. I will an idea, but I try my best refrain from insulting the person (unless they start it). </p>

<p>I&#39;ll see if I can find an image or some such.</p>

<p><em>edit</em> Couldn&#39;t find any images or anything, but I found some articles. Literally takes 2 seconds to search. Just type in Michael Bay funded by DoD.</p>

<p>This article was written by the DoD themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>That second link  says that Michael Bay (or whoever) paid 25k/hour to the DoD for the use of F22s alone ...sooooo...thats literally the opposite of funding.  Michael Bay is funding the DoD.</p>

<p>The first link doesn&#39;t support the claim that the DoD funds Michael Bay either.  Maybe you shoulda taken more than 2 seconds to search.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone would or could deny that the DoD supports and works with Hollywood directors to make pro-military movies...but actively funding them?  Not so sure.</p>

<p>TV shows like homefront and films like Zero Dark Thirty are terrifyingly potent with propaganda, but the US public have been trained to lap it up, and circle jerk their way through the box office.</p>

One chapter of the doc talks about how our whole economy is based on war; its a war economy. The narrator speculates that we don&#39;t know how/couldn&#39;t run our economy without war. I feel like there has to be another way but that is a difficult transition (whatever it may be). </p>

The point is that there is no justice and that normal, good people save the day (on the bomb boats) without batmans help. He learns he&#39;s become the bad guy he was trying to stop</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense, I don&#39;t meant to presume anything, but how much do you really know about the creative process, in any field? Lots of things are literally done for no other reason than to move from point A in the plot to point B, to build tension making the resolution more effective, or hell, because it&#39;s &#39;cool&#39;. Not to mention that mass surveillance is a relevant issue to paint some drama around.</p>

<p>I have no reason to question why a government might have a stake in mainstream movies as far as being propaganda, but once you go through the looking glass, literally any plot point, scenario or character that happens to endorse or line up with a government&#39;s views is going to be &#39;propaganda&#39;, even when those characters are villains. </p>

<p>But Batman is a vigilante. He doesn&#39;t kill, but he does &#39;what&#39;s necessary&#39;. Of course that&#39;s going to line up the interests of a government. It doesn&#39;t make the character or a Batman movie anything other than a typical vigilante fantasy.</p>

<p>I am sure both movies promote the official story in one way or another.</p>

<p>Namely: &quot;Germans were evil. They tried to kill all the Jews. Hitler committed suicide. USA! USA! (or some ally analogue)&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they did destroy as many as they could before they got busted, once they realised they had fucked and lost the war horribly. Still, plenty of evidence remained that justified the whole scale murder of millions of Jews. Most estimates are between 5-7 but it&#39;s not an easy thing to pin down. They didn&#39;t give them all individual graves, you iknow.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Eisenhower even took lots of pictures and documented as much as he could because he predicted that future nazis would try to white-wash germany&#39;s war crimes, which they admitted in the nuremberg trials they had tried to cover up.</p>

<p>Despite this, you still believe nazi propaganda that eisenhower even predicted being spun. You&#39;re a puppet for a long-dead government, it&#39;s a really weird choice in life that must be at least partially based in hatred of minorities or more specificlaly jews.</p>

<p>Being a &quot;very good movie&quot;, doesn&#39;t mean that it isn&#39;t a propaganda piece. No one is being told the truth about WWII in any movie. Not the whole truth anyway. But then again, that&#39;s how limited hangout work.</p>

<p>This is how they were able to turn all the media into weapons of propaganda. All to keep us ignorant. All to keep us under control.</p>

<p>But because it entertained <strong>YOU</strong>, despite not having anything of substance to offer society, it is now passed around so all the idiot sheep watch it and believe it has something to do with reality. Now everyone believes the bullshit.</p>

Art can serve an infinite amount of ends to an infinite amount of people, but you have such a puerile, useless attitude towards it that I can frankly do nothing with. Whether or not <strong>I</strong> (I like how you bolded it, to emphasize that I&#39;m particularly part of the problem) am entertained has nothing to do with it. </p>

<p>Lots of people do not think critically about what they consume, and that&#39;s a problem. But you&#39;re not interested in dealing with people, just thoughtless, worthless sheep. By all means, purposefully avoid things under the premise of being above influence or a &#39;critical thinker, buy into your own bullshit if you feel you have something substantive to offer society. I love the attitude from people who benefit from the same system as me acting like they woke up to the whole thing.</p>

This is an area where the VA has been criticized as not doing enough to help. The government is actively using film as a mechanism to push the needle the other direction in the matter of veteran mental health.</p>

<p>I would recommend reading the book &quot;Propaganda&quot; by Edward Bernays (<a href="https://archive.org/details/Propaganda1928">https://archive.org/details/Propaganda1928</a>). In this book, he talks about using local leaders and having them stand up in the middle of restaurant and other public places giving &quot;impromptu&quot; speeches trying to sway public opinion about war. As time has progressed, film is just a new medium used to sway public opinion about issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>high corporate tax rates only for corporations without stellar accounting firms and lobbying groups in DC.  The top corporations in America pay an effective tax rate of 0% to -10% (subsidized).  Some gov&#39;t sponsored monopolies are a necessity - would you want 10 coal fired power plants vying in each town for the consumer&#39;s business?  that might choke out everyone in the town.  I&#39;d say that we definitely aren&#39;t the Capitalist States of America, but rather the Corporate States of America.  We certainly need to lower the corporate tax rate while also closing the loopholes that have allowed for the richest corporations in our country to get off completely scott-free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One further thought - I have a strong feeling that the top corporations were big proponents of making our corporate tax rate one of the highest (if not the highest in the world).  My logic behind this is that the top corporations, the ones already making the rules and sitting at the top of their respective industries&#39; thrones, hike up the corporate tax rate to make it damn near impossible for smaller competitors to keep up and challenge them in their marketplace while they have the top accounting firms, lobbying groups, and offshore bank accounts to ensure that they do not have to play by the same rules as their less influential competitors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just war movies. The other day I watched an old Cowboy movie [from the 60&#39;s I think]. In it all the actors were white, blonde, blue eyed nice people...apart from the Natives, they were shown to be blood thirsty and evil, just out to kill the poor white settlers. :( :P</p>

<p>But if you looked at it as it was, the settlers were living on the Native&#39;s land without a proper contract and had build already a house, plus taken some land they claimed was theirs.</p>

<p>The Native men were only doing what anyone would do to protect their home land and families. They weren&#39;t evil IMO at all. I rooted for the Natives of course; but didn&#39;t finish watching due to boredom.</p>

<p>That is how almost all American films seem to me, unless they are made by independent companies.</p>

<p>The entirety of Iron Man 2 is a love song to gun ownership rights. The movie literally opens with the government trying to take the suit and his tech away and he says fuck you. Then they literally steal his stuff and he has to get it kick their asses and the ass of the guy the government has selling them weapons.</p>

<p>The catalyst for all this is way back in the first Iron Man when he refuses to take do any more government weapons contracts or sell weapons at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no one will read this, but I am interested in the flip side of this coin where some movies offer a &quot;soft disclosure&quot; approach to revealing previously hidden truths to the public as opposed to trying to brainwash the public with propaganda.</p>

<p>For example there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAVhPLV4E6w">a scene in Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a> where Scarlet Johansson explains how Nazi scientists were brought to America after WW2 and called it by its actual name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">Operation Paperclip</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>not all war movies are the same (not that I think that&#39;s how you think, but just had to say it).  Some movies are much more glorifying/one-sided, yet others do a very good job at showing the grey area and allows for acknowledging the &quot;enemy&quot; as human beings with their own points of view.  Saving Private Ryan/American Sniper may err more on the side of a propaganda/&quot;rah rah go America&quot; film while others like The Hurt Locker, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, and The Deer Hunter show the very real effects of PTSD, depression, and the general sense of &quot;why are we even here?&quot; that many soldiers may ask themselves at some point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest problem with the movie industry right now isn&#39;t the government - It&#39;s the industry&#39;s fear of taking chances and reliance on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_research">market research</a>.</p>

<p>Movie studios don&#39;t want to make these <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/54440/why-do-hollywood-movies-cost-so-much-make">bloated</a> 100+ million dollar investments in films that aren&#39;t <em>absolutely 100% guaranteed</em> to get them a $atisfying return as a result. So instead of trying to judge a script on its own merits, they&#39;ll see if something like it has been done before; whether the demographic in question will see X genre of movie with Y lead actor, et cetera. If it&#39;s a big dumb robot/action movie, they&#39;ll see how well it&#39;ll play with foreign markets (specifically China).</p>

<p>They want everything that&#39;s going to happen spelled out on paper before a single cent is sunk into the project, and there is absolutely no margin for financial failure. Turning a new idea into a widely-theatrically-released movie is nothing short of a small miracle these days, and most people with creative integrity are disgusted at the Hollywood process (rewrites, etc) that their vision would have to undergo anyway.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why &gt;95% of all decent entertainment has been coming out on TV (or in independent films) for the past 10 years or so - the stakes are lower, and people are actually willing to take chances. Hollywood is so far up its own ass it&#39;s almost shocking when a decent film comes out these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Promise me that you will never make an attempt to dramatize or adapt anything, because that would, by far, be the most boring movie I have ever seen. Even on points I agree with, This is the End didn&#39;t subtly wrap comedy around a &#39;judeo-christian fear narrative&#39;. It&#39;s a comedy. There&#39;s nothing subtle about it, that&#39;s literally what they did. What&#39;s your point? </p>

<p>Absolutely no one walked away from that film fearing the apocalypse, or with the sense that they needed to be fed some dogma. Even with The Interview, when it&#39;s obvious how self serving and useful it is as propaganda, one of the people you&#39;re talking about is high the vast majority of the day. You can read it into it all you want, but a stoner making a stoner comedy is about as deep as a puddle. It can serve to drive perception, but it&#39;s primary function is to entertain.</p>

<p>The James Bond thing, yeah, duh. Being a spy, especially before the era of information, had an air of mystery. You want to argue that it promotes certain ideals or political ideas over others, sure. But that&#39;s retarded. Ian Flemming came up with a character, people saw money in it, and the jet setting, girl getting intrigue is an appealing trope. If it makes spy agencies look sexy, well duh. It&#39;s a movie. Would anyone have cared an inch about James Bond if he had zero charisma and a stutter? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a movie. In general, a movie&#39;s job is not to provide you with an objective message or ideal, it&#39;s to utilize drama, music, lighting, dialog, suspense, tension, to entertain people on the basest of levels. Can movies serve as tools for the government? Sure, and I have no reason to question why they&#39;d have a marked interest in using them as tools. But examples like that are grasping at straws.</p>

<p>I mean hell, why stop at the movies? Let&#39;s question the source material as well. Clearly, people like Frank Miller, Ian Flemming, James Franco and Seth Rogen weren&#39;t thinking of anything other than serving the government to the best of their ability. Look at Batman. Clearly, a couple of barely 20 year old Jews created a vigilante as propaganda, which they knew would be used a century later.</p>

<p>The only major blockbuster war film I&#39;ve watched that didn&#39;t seem to do it to the degree expected was Capatain America 1(ironic I know!!!) That seemed to actually be quite considered in their suggestions of what form and shape patriotism should take on. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still waiting for a Vietnam War film showing the Viet Cong&#39;s perspective. That would be absolutely mind-blowing cinema.</p>

<p>Even Team America World Police was propaganda in their eventual message too, the whole: if someone has gotta be on top it&#39;s better that it&#39;s us, message </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI op all Hollywood productions that use US military hardware have to have their script approved by the DOD - all war films are definitely propaganda.. In fact.. I&#39;d go as far as saying that a large portion of movies have dubious messages or intentions. It would make sense that Hollywood is entirely compromised.. By whom and to what extent I don&#39;t know.. But blackmail would be a place to start.. This could be why the surveillance apparatus is so important to the state.. Not only in the entertainment industry but  financial and political too.. Given Hollywood&#39;s track record with peadophilia you would be dumb, as a nation state in the game of spying and propaganda, to not take advantage of that.</p>

<p>Fury, holy shit.</p>

<p>All of the allies troops were dishelved nice guys with personalties that just wanted to see their family and rid the world from evil!!</p>

<p>Every German soldier was a nasty bald nazi with no remorse and that stereotype &#39;evil&#39; look. They were all organised and dehumanised. </p>

<p>Not to mention the daft last battle and other parts, but also showing the german soldiers marching and then slaughtering them with out any remorse, ignoring the fact they were just young men that were mislead. Not mentioning they also had families, children, ambitions, dreams and futures, no just slaughter them and celebrate Brad Pitt taking 5000 bullets and getting blown up by 2 grenades and staying intact. </p>

<p>I&#39;m English by the way, so its not as if I have some pro-german agenda, but the film was really quite disgustingly one-sided, though I imagine most other world war 2 films are but I&#39;ve never really had the same outlook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that they are mostly propaganda, and the brainwashing effect can be pretty powerful, especially for shows like law and order. But on the flip side, I don&#39;t believe a lot of these are conspiracies. I enjoy a lot of those movies and actually really enjoy law and order. On the flip side, I think police brutality is out of control and that our continued wars amount to nothing more then mass murder to progress corporate agendas with the complicity of the mainstream media. So yeah, these things can be used as propaganda, but the problem is obviously much deeper when our population molds its view of the world through Hollywood movies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on the movie. Some are some aren&#39;t. But most of them are. But that&#39;s nothing unique to the US. Motion pictures have been used for propaganda since it came even somewhat accessible for the greater public.</p>

<p>I mean I don&#39;t blame them, it&#39;s a good tactic. I&#39;d use it as well if I&#39;d want to spread propaganda.</p>

<p>But we need to separate propaganda and propaganda. Just building on national pride like most US movies do, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s propaganda aimed to change the minds of people. Then you have the other form of propaganda that aims to convince people to think in one way or another. And that&#39;s the bad propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WWIII is coming so they need everybody to feel patriotic and join the military, that&#39;s why movies like American Sniper are released.
By the way, American Sniper is a 2 hour commercial for the Military.
With American Sniper there is no way to see beyond the amount of propaganda they put in in.
And if you make a movies that displays the military in a bad way, they don&#39;t provide you with advice and material. 
So your movies is gone suck, if you call it Black Hawk Down and use UH-1 Iroquois helicopters instead of UH-60 Black Hawks.
That is how the government keeps grip on the pro/anti war movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole entertainment industry is seen as a soft power instrument by the american government on various levels and in various departments including the DoD. There are even specific offices in DoD whose jobs are pitching, working with, and facilitating access to materiel and personnel in the military. A lot of it is self perpetuating and self reaffirming, i.e., we like movies in which we are the good guys and winning against bad guys with our technical and tactical superiority, but it encompasses movies, TV, music, and especially video games. There is a natural element to it, but it cannot be said that our government doesn&#39;t facilitate that soft power, let alone, out of principle, reject supporting it. Ultimately it benefits the government and military if people have been conditioned with propaganda that we always win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont really see how American Sniper is propaganda. It was clearly arguing against joining the military. If you want a fucked up life then join the military is how i saw it. Almost nothing positive happens in the movie. By the end of it hes a broken man that has to be fixed because of war. The only downside to the movie being that it doesnt show americas wrong doings in that war but that wasnt the point of the movie in the first place.</p>

<p>In the end any movie can be propaganda if you let it be. Ive never heard of someone joining the military because of a movie though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A  book called &quot;hollywood goes to war&quot; talked about how after  ww1 the us public was understandably completely against war. Remember that war had ended when the mothers of soldiers had march by the thousands in the street to protest the never ending war in an event now ironically honored as a war parade called veterans day.</p>

<p>Anyway. So no one wanted to enlist.</p>

<p>Well the powers called up hollywood who dreamed up the movie &quot;Sargent  York&quot; staring gary cooper.  Its the story of a  deep rural southern game hunter pacifist who doesnt want to enlist but then goes to war and, after  seeing his buddies killed, picks off huge numbers of germans and gets even more to surrender just to him.</p>

<p>The movie was a huge hit. It won academy awards and  ... Most importantly... After huge numbers of the pubkic had seen it their polls showed americans wrre no longer pacifist.</p>

<p>Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Afghanistan and Iraq movies always have this tone of &quot;We bring these people peace and freedom and look how happy they are now&quot;.</p>

<p>The only war movies that are being nowadays are WWII movies (but only the war agains Nazi Germany, not agains the Japanese) because that is the only war that the US ever won, and only because they waited long enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve read a lot of people do.... I find this to be kind of narrow minded though to be honest.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a movie about one man&#39;s story in a war. Of course it&#39;s going to be shown from his perspective which may seem narrow minded and &quot;toolish&quot;, but it&#39;s a movie <em>about</em> him so that would only make sense, right?</p>

<p>I mean how many movies are out there that have main characters with questionable morale? Movies that involve rape, mass murders, gang activity etc.... yet people don&#39;t go around saying that it&#39;s promoting the activity because they generally realize that it&#39;s just telling a story.</p>

<p>But personally, I didnt feel like the war is glamorized. The man suffered from PTSD and struggled to live a &quot;normal&quot; life. It showed the hardship that war has on a person and the people that they love.</p>

<p>I think people (not necessarily you) are getting too worked up over the film and reading too into the message. It&#39;s a story about one guy in the wars perspective,  that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>I sad it is a similar movie concept to the Nazi propaganda film in Inglorious Bastards except that it is American propaganda.</p>

<p>You should see the stupid comments and backlash I got for suggesting it. Not to mention most people are complete morons.</p>

<p>I think the global profiteers of the Military Industrial Complex are just trying to promote the idea of unlimited unknown terror suspects &amp; sell their goods to police forces. That way it is harder for conspiracists to untangle a denser web of profiteering propaganda &amp; staged acts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what about the freedoms you have? How did you get those freedoms? And to those questions you may say &quot;what freedoms? We&#39;re living in a controlled works and we have no freedoms etc etc etc&quot; the truth is your not being rounded up for execution because of your skin color or eye color or choice of religion or your sex or sexuality or who your family is or for any other reasons.  Your not in shackles and chains being sold to a rich Shiek who wants to take your virginity and is willing to buy you as an object.  Your not being thrown in prison for what you post on reddit or anywhere online about your thoughts about the government.  All of those rights you are enjoying were bought and paid for with blood.  People for a few generations have fought and died so you could have the freedom to sit there with your own opinion and think that crap.  You can think whatever you want to about the government.  That&#39;s your freedom.  But you seriously need to fucking check your self before talking shit on our military and the men and women who serve.  Without them doing what they do you couldn&#39;t sit on your couch or computer or whatever and do what you do and talk shit on them.  Just fucking think about the big picture and realistically give it a serious thought for once. Do you under stand people are killed in other countries for saying half of what you did? Or in other nations like north Korea people are killed and executed if they simply turn their back to a picture of Kim Jong Un which they are forced to put in their house and bow to it every day. Just fucking think about what you say about certain things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s for the public to decide. Theoretical: would you rather have a mayor of your city who was a corrupt crooked yet outwardly squeaky clean a-hole, or a guy who genuinely and in your opinion has the best interests of the community in his heart and the ability to act on that in the office, yet was imprisoned in the past for a serious non-felony?</p>

<p>The great irony of our system is that for most higher state offices, most states have laws that disallow felons from running, but go read the Constitution...you can be a convicted serial killer and still run for and even be allowed under law to win the Presidency or Congress as long as you meet the age and residency requirements. </p>

<p>Almost makes one think the founding fathers had no intention of arrest records or crimes already left in the past keeping people from participating in their government, but that&#39;s just domestic terrorist talk ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What amazes me is that we are really stupid ignorantly blind of what a militarized society we are. Everything is always military. &quot;All&quot; of our historic sites are military / war related if not even just literally a couple of dirt mounds  in some woods that were used as cover. It&#39;s not even as surprising how many of our historic sites are war related, but it&#39;s even more surprising, albeit even more difficult, once you start realizing all the historic events that aren&#39;t marked or documented well. </p>
