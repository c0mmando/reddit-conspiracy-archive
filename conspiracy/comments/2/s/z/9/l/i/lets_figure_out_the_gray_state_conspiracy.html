       The news of this freaked me out earlier today. I remember seeing the trailer for Gray State a few years ago, but nothing ever came of it. Then news of the murder-suicide today, and I've been hunting around for some additional details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some questions I have:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the family hadn't been seen since Christmas, why hadn't anyone investigated this sooner? Why didn't either David or Komel's families raise suspicions?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did the dog survive for so long in the house?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Komel stop Tweeting in late October?

        https://twitter.com/mindbody_rd
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Did any coworkers or clients of either try to reach them?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the status of the Gray State film?

       I would suggest to everyone to look at the subject matter of this film and the decide if you want to spend your energy in support of finding out the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me personally no film is worth my time if it doesn't try to look at events in a way that helps us change them. This seems like IMHO a psy-op attempt at misdirecting peoples energy away from supportive pursuits into fear based "we cant do anything about it, so we might as well focus on the fear of doom and destruction". For those who haven't watched the trailer, its seems like there is an enormous amount of energy and time put into the production value of the hyper details of control by creating imagery that is designed to instill fear into the subconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have been warned, you can be controlled though your subconscious fears.

       ) and Nietzsche would disagree you with there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value I see in Gray State is that it portrays our zeitgeist's fear of a police state and confronts it. It packages this information into a familiar good guy vs. bad guy narrative. That could be enough to get peoples' attention and get them to care about things a little bit more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, we can avoid the "imagery" and symbols of power, but that doesn't mean they aren't happening. Look at the militarization of police. Look at Anaheim, Ferguson. It's happening whether you look at it or not. And if people aren't willing to call it out or confront it, it'll get a lot worse.

       Its all about balance, perception creates reality, If you take a look at "Century of the Self" it shows how Edward Bernays was able to convince the world into a self-important capitalistic society focused only on material wealth at the expense of all life on the planet though a massive propaganda campaign that was completely one sided. We live in that world now.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to change that vision we need an 20/80 approach. 20% current events %80 active approach to what we can do about it.

       Mind control is achieved though shocking your target into submission with violent imagery that correlates with unconscious fears. This film is right down that alley.

       Calling it out is only awareness, it actual makes things worse if the energy isnt directed into a positive action. So far I have been seeing a lot of people point shit out, with no intention on showing people or contributing ideas on how to act. "Out of chaos, comes order" Which order would you like to come out of chaos? If you leave it up to the power structures, its not going to be pretty.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want to change things we need to a a new approach, we need to get everyone on board to help creating a new way to contribute to society. Its starts by ignoring power structures attempts to gain jurisdiction and authority over us by creating heart centered action with people acting from empowerment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a few suggestions on how to do that:
      </p>
      <p>
       You can join a group that is working on creating a new society: It looks like
       <a href="http://www.ubuntuplanet.org/">
        http://www.ubuntuplanet.org/
       </a>
       is trying to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also take a look at my proposal on how to create a contrbutionism society:
       <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths">
        http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I currently need people to personally recommend others that have a good history in bringing awareness while also acting from that awareness into the Committee for Political Change. This would be the first group that would help create the Commonwealths Communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you can create something yourself that compels people to act.
If you focus on what power structures give us, that's what we will create in our lives. This is really about redefining your relationship with power, to the world and to your own belief systems.
The matrix movie is a really good example of redefining yourself by concidering yourself as the NEO Character.

       Fair enough. Good response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling shit out and leaving it at that is the story of these forums. Positive action is hard to follow through on. People don't know what to do. However, with the Gray State project many people are saying that they're willing to chip in and get it made. Perhaps it could be steered towards being more positive and not just fear porn?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your thoughts on Gray State, do you find it suspicious that $61,000 was raised for pre-production, and nothing has happened since that? We have that admittedly violent and shocking trailer and that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was trying to be somewhat objective with the investigation in this thread...I don't understand how these people could disappear for weeks without people noticing or trying to contact them. Their social media accounts dropped off by late October.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have an incisive mind and I'd be eager to hear more of what's on it. We don't need to bicker...divide and conquer is another strategy used against the people.

       This is true. I appreciate your views on this. I sually call people out as a first action. if it is someone that its trying to manipulate opinion they will either usually not respond, misdirect, or restort to personal attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       You did not do that, and so far seem like a human being. I am also curious as to what happened, how this film was made and why it was made in the way it was. But im more concerned about helping people choose a more supportive path.

       I think we can make this sub how-ever we want to make it. It could be a place for action I think a lot of people have the right idea I just think we could use this potential to create a new society that completely changes the structure of our world.

       I completely agree with you. I'm all for the creation of a new society with new structures.

       However, I feel many people are still in the process of waking up, so to speak. And many are "still asleep". They won't be in favor of new structures or a new society until they question the structures and society they are currently in, until they see that "something is rotten in the State of Denmark".
      </p>

       Perhaps there needs to be a new sub for positive action...less fear mongering and more "this is an issue...here's what we can do".

       Of course, but awareness starts with love, not fear. However we chose to create awareness is going to determine the kind of awareness we cultivate.

       I would prefer never to fight and I pray that I am never asked to watch people I care about killed out of fear.  But I can understand the place of the story being told by Gray State and similar stories.  They provide a space for our unconscious to play out give us opportunities to make better choices.

       So much fucking speculation mate, let people investigate what ever the fuck they want to investigate, just because the movie is dark doesn't make it a psy-op. You've been watching too many American movies it seems and crave a positive message/outcome.

       Wha? IMO we could do with a little more fear of the police state. There's so much fear and big budget propaganda pushing us in the other "patriotic" (nationalist) direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your argument here exactly? The film is deceptive and negative/unproductive, so we should not bother paying attention to its creators murder?
      </p>
      <p>
       The deception you point out would be moving us in a direction that would be contrary to what a scary defensive state would want. That makes it an even juicier conspiracy theory to chat on, so i don't understand where you're going with this. It seems negative/unproductive, i'd rather pay attention in case i need to do something positive.

       Crowley's latest credit on IMDB had him working on this project:
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3903558/?ref_=nm_flmg_ardp_1">

       Had anyone from the film tried to contact him? Was he currently working on it?

       Also, did either David or Komel have friends that tried to contact them? It seems odd that they would go MIA for 20+ days without friends or family raising suspicions...

       I've been thinking about this a lot and joined Reddit just to comment on this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like something happened last fall. Neighbors say David cut his hair very short and started wearing fatigues. Komel and David, both very active on social media stopped Instagramming and Tweeting by the end of October. Komel also stopped blogging.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't see why the family didn't raise the alarm when the Crowleys were not present at the holidays. The only explanation I can't think of is that there were some family estrangement for them to miss the holidays and none of the family to go to Apple Valley and check on them (David's dad told the Star Tribune they "tried" to contact them over Christmas, but got no response).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since they were both self-employed I can see why no coworkers raised the alarm, but what about Rani's school? In this
       <a href="http://instagram.com/p/skDNX3nzfE/?modal=true">
        Instagram pic,
       </a>
       Komel talks about enjoying making her daughter's school lunches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've seen some posts on other threads about people saying no one heard gunshots, but the neighbor who found them now says he thought he heard gunshots one night in December.

       Been a lurker here for about a year, never commented. But I feel like I might actually have something to offer this time that I've not seen anyone else notice or mention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it strike anyone as odd that the names of the 3 principal talents involved with "Gray State" are:
      </p>
      <p>
       David CROWLEY - Director &amp; Writer
      </p>
      <p>
       Mitch HEIL - Director of Photography
      </p>
      <p>
       Danny MASON - Lead Actor
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that not a triumvirate of suspicious monickers? Almost like a joke, in fact? I googled "Gray State" and "Psy-Op" and found this:
       <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/is-gray-state-psy-op.html">
        http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/is-gray-state-psy-op.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Writer makes some good points. 1st time I watched the trailer, frankly, I didn't even watch it to the end. It was so dark, oppressive and needlessly violent. Didn't sit right with me -- without hope, nobody's going to pay to see this movie, &amp; it sure as hell looked expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying anything one way or the other. Just noting something I'd not seen mentioned elsewhere.

       The fact that both the posts where I made this comment have been voted off the front page and a new one that is only full of comments that instill feelings of fear, martyrdom and/or hopelessness has pretty much sealed the deal for me. The rest of the community is, of course, welcome to come to its own conclusion, but I'm letting this one go.

       they already had most of the equipment.  Most of the actors/crew were friends, volunteers, or people that believed in the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO most for the budget went to props.  They said the budget for the concept trailer was only $7000.  Most of it is green screen and cgi backgrounds.  The post processing work just takes time if you already know how to work the programs (maya, after effects, smoke, 3ds max,etc) which Crowley did.

       From what I can tell, there are 2 Gray State productions:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The narrative film for which he developed a trailer and was pitching in LA
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

       Agreed. I'm surprised they didn't have more of an indie mindset towards this project.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the trailer cost 6k to make, they could have pulled off a movie for 1mil.

       Ink, a terrific indie film by Jamin Winans, reportedly only cost 250k

       I haven't followed any of this but what was more problematic about his movie than say snowpiercer or hungers game? the truth is in both these movies really, is it more specific, naming and shaming particular individuals or?

       Snowpiercer is truthful only to the discerning eye. To the uninformed, it's fantasy that can later be used to dismiss elements of reality. I don't know anything about this Gray State film, but it sounds like it was a reality-based portrayal of Shit Going Down. That's definitely not the same as the allegorical container of Snowpiercer. And Hunger Games doesn't have much truth  embedded even for the keen observer.

       Right. Snowpiercer is allegory. Gray State was calling out FEMA and who knows what/who else.

       Sorry, I don't know what you're referring to with the "conspiracy about the trains with shackles". Last I checked this was happening back during the War of Northern Aggression, a bit before Snowpiercer... Maybe you could clarify.

       I should add that my understanding of what's commonly known as "predictive programming" is a bit different than the alt-media default. I suspect it's more about being able to dismiss the reasonable conclusions of puzzling evidence as "that's just the stuff of fiction".

       I am not convinced those trains are what you and the video author think they are. Not saying that I know you're wrong, just that the evidence presented is still pretty ambiguous. Of course, all the other militarization stuff is demonstrably and verifiably happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I am well aware of predictive programming, the link you gave does not address my understanding of its function -- namely, as a cover and a reduced willingness to consider scenarios covered in fantastical fiction as real possibilities.

       Additional questions I came up with:
      </p>
      <p>
       Was their 5 year old enrolled in school? If so, were they wondering where said child was?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it true that media can't release the names of deceased until next of kin have been notified? If they have been notified, I'm wondering what they might say about the situation. Was Komer thinking about divorce? Were they having financial difficulty? Was Crowley on meds? So far, we only have comments from a neighbor and an actor.

       Thanks for putting words in my mouth ;). All I said was that I think it's a ridiculous claim that your government executes people for making films. You're gonna need some concrete proof to back you up if you want anyone to believe you.

       Smells bad... But wouldn't murdering him simply increase the visibility of his project? Unless they think they can kill the movie, which is unlikely now that others will pick up the mantle.

       2 schools of thought on this
      </p>
      <p>
       Bear with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having made a film or two, the IMDB page may not have been updated for a while and the film could be at various stages of production/post, and people can go a long stretch with out hearing from the producer about the progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the in progress IMDB page means nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here are the possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious that this film was pissing in more than a few powerful people's punch bowls,  so there is always the possibility that this was a hit.  And it's not a stretch to think that, biggest question that we need answered is who did it?  Not who actually carried it out, but who ordered it. Find that, then we got something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using logic and my general knowledge of how expensive films are and what people will do to get them done, one could easily paint a picture that he had put his family into financial ruin to get it done, then became incredibly depressed when it didn't pan out and he couldn't recoup any of his investment.  Causing him to lose all hope because his message would never be received by the public and he just made life rough for his family.  Then he does the unthinkable...
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems more like a stretch than the hit theory IMO. Because this guy seemed fairly stable, and maybe smart/ connected enough to secure funding for production. But then again, maybe his backers backed out. Who knows.  It stinks to high heavens that's for sure.

       Good thinking. I tend to think the former.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the latter, he supposedly secured 30 million from a Hollywood producer recently...but I did see that via a FB post on his page. Also likely that it could have fallen through. But if it did fall through, wouldn't crowdfunding be an option? They had raised money before, they could do it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully we get more details soon.

       His Gray State documentary was one of the best I've seen recently. You have to invite the possibility that he was in fact murdered, no matter how conspiratorial it all seems.

       The author sounds sane and logical... He is evaluating the notion that the "rough cut" film which is supposed to be everywhere (when you search), is actually some documentary about it....
       <strong>
        But
       </strong>
       the documentary contains information that is specifically designed to evoke a particular reaction... He suggests that it is designed to perhaps make people more paranoid...maybe even provoke an attack of some government or police personnel by citizens given that the government only needs an excuse to really start implementing something resembling martial law (although it would never be called that).
      </p>
      <p>
       He also makes a comment about the soundtrack.  I paid attention to it and he is right... there does seem to be something else in the soundtrack.  Check out the documentary and let me know what you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way...
       <em>
        does anyone know where I can get an actual rough cut of this film
       </em>
       ?  I run into accounts by countless people on various boards who say they were able to watch it.  It was pulled from youtube, but there were a few other sites hosting it..  I have looked high and low, and can only find the documentary "Making of" or whatever it is.  I would like to see the dramatized fictional account of the police state takeover movie—a "rough cut" or which was apparently finished.

       Someone named who knew and worked with David Kirk West posted this on Facebook this afternoon:
      </p>
      <p>
       As many of you probably know by now, David Crowley, the writer/director behind the planned feature film "Gray State" was found dead along with his wife and 5 year old daughter over the weekend in what appears to be a murder-suicide that happened around Christmas. I hesitate to even bring some of this stuff up and get involved in this whole ordeal in the wake of such a tragedy, but there's been SO MUCH conspiracy theorizing surrounding his death that I really feel I should say something. Because for several reasons I just don't think he was assassinated. I hope to God that he and his family were killed in botched home invasion or something like that, because I liked Crowley, but honestly... I have a bad feeling that the whole "murder-suicide" angle the media has been reporting is exactly right.
I actually knew David Crowley. Not incredibly well, really, but he was a fellow libertarian filmmaker and someone I would have counted as a casual friend. I first reached out to him in December 2011 while I was working on One Man's Terrorist and I ran across the very first Gray State-related video he ever released. I thought it was awesome to see another libertarian filmmaker out there making films with similar subject matter. After that, we chatted a fair bit on Facebook and email, met up and hung out at Paul Fest in August 2012, exchanged script notes on each other's projects, and talked about potentially working together in the future. He always seemed to be good guy to me. Hardworking, intelligent, and intense. Sometimes a bit cryptic and short online, but generally friendly, and much more laid back in person.
To be honest, for once I can actually totally understand all the conspiracy theorizing. This situation is weird, it seems out of character, and given the subject matter of Gray State, well… I can definitely see how it looks like an assassination. Hell, as someone who spends a lot of time debunking conspiracy theories, I've often joked that even if
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       were ever to die of anything other than old age it'd inspire a lot of conspiracy theories. So I totally understand why so many of you immediately thought that this seemed incredibly suspicious, but please allow me to present you with some reasons why you should at least keep your mind open to the idea that this really was the murder-suicide the media has been reporting it as.
In 2012 and 2013 we chatted relatively regularly, but over the last year or so my contact with him was pretty sporadic. After I learned of his death, I went back and read through our last few conversations. When I did that, something hit me… He was having money issues. He told me over a year ago that “finally went broke,” and on that occasion and another several months later, he asked me how I made ends meet as someone who does filmmaking sort of full time. I’ve attached screen grabs of these conversations, but I mostly want to share with you the second instance of this, because last June he said something to me that, in hindsight, is incredibly chilling:
David Crowley, 6/19/14:
“let me ask you something
how do you live with filmmaking as your profession? last we talked you do the odd paid gig now and then
how do you stay motivated? don't you panic when things get slow? Don't you stress and worry? I can't get away from evil thoughts some days.”
This is BY FAR the best (though not the ONLY) evidence I have that the murder-suicide angle is accurate. At the time, I didn’t really think anything of his “evil thoughts” comment. I figured he meant that he was feeling dejected due Gray State not taking off quite the way he’d hoped and that he was considering abandoning the project or something. I didn't ask him to elaborate on it, and we just shifted into talking about filmmaking contests and YouTube revenue as a source of income for the next half hour.
As I looked back through our conversations and checked out Crowley’s Social Media profiles, I started to notice a few other weird things. The first thing I noticed was that, some time in November or December, he unfriended me, which is really strange to me seeing as how we were casual friends and libertarian-filmmaking peers who had talked about working together in the future during our last ever conversation (more on that later). I checked with Lucas Wolf, and it turns out he had been unfriended by Crowley as well. I’d be really curious to see how far it goes, because I suspect that he unfriended a LOT of people for seemingly no reason. His Instagram profile is still following mine, but he hadn't updated it since October 1st. [1/3]

       [2/3]
      </p>
      <p>
       The next thing I notice is that the two pictures I can still see on his personal facebook page are… Really weird. Sometime after our last conversation at the end of October, his profile picture—which in the past had usually been a very professional and high quality headshot—changed to a really strange picture of a dog that appears to have been taken with a cell phone. The lighting is terrible, the framing is awkward, the focus doesn’t seem to be right, and due to what appears to be a drop ceiling behind the dog, it almost looks like it was taken by someone laying on their back on the ground (I’d really love to know what date it was uploaded, but as we aren’t FB friends any more, I can’t see that).
The next picture is his cover photo, which is some kind of horribly-put-together panoramic shot of his front yard. It was posted on October 29th, the day after he talked to me about collaborating on a potential Gray State web-series and then never messaged me again. I actually think it might have been a botched attempt at one of those 360-degree panoramic ball photos you occasionally see on Google Earth. Lots of new smart phones can do them. The picture is bizarrely stitched together, has an extreme fisheye look to it, massive patches of it are black due the camera moving, and legs that I assume to be Crowley’s hilariously and awkwardly poke into the shot in two places thanks to the haphazard stitching. For a guy who really knew his way around a camera and usually posted very professional-looking photos, pictures like these two just don’t make any sense.
To top it all off, he made some rather strange posts on his professional facebook page (the one that people “like” instead of “friend”) between October 22nd and 24th. Posts like:
“All the convicts I speak to are better read.”
“I've had more servings of absinthe this week than I've had meals, and the balance of life, work, family have never been more balanced.
I reject your notions of sanity and supplant my own.”
“You're either the fool who doesn't follow your dreams, or you're the fool who does.”
“Absinthe while edit”
He also posted a quote on the 24th that isn’t really all that weird. He said, “You're either the fool who doesn't follow your dreams, or you're the fool who does.” Which, like I said, isn’t that weird. But the comment he made on that post about 2 hours later IS weird. He simply said, “Somebody tell me what you feel”. These two posts combined definitely give the impression that he was going through something emotionally trying at the time. Considering the fact that only 3 days later he contacted me and at least one more person about working on a Gray State web-series, could it be that the emotionally trying thing he was going through was a huge Gray State setback?
The grammatically incorrect and not-at-all-punctuated allusion to drinking “Absinthe while edit,” actually made his brother Dan Crowley ask, “Is that why you never respond to texts?” Which definitely seems to indicate that he hadn’t been doing very good at staying in touch with his family. All in all, from the the weird pictures and posts to the random unfriending, that’s pretty strange behavior if you ask me. Not particularly alarm-raising in most circumstances, but when someone’s being accused of murdering his wife and daughter and committing suicide, well… It does at least HINT that he could have been going through some mental problems.
As far as not responding to his brother’s texts goes, there’s more evidence that Crowley was becoming withdrawn than just that. Here is an excerpt from a Minneapolis/St. Paul Fox Affiliate that came out in the wake of the Crowley family’s deaths:
“Charles Hubbel was an actor in the trailer and says in recent months Crowley became despondent that the project had lost steam.
‘September time... he stopped talking to people,’ Hubbel says. ‘He asked me to stay in touch with him so we could support each other, and he just stopped taking my calls... He was in a place where he needed help, and it was too big for him to help himself.’”
So there’s definitely a pattern of Crowley becoming withdrawn and uncommunicative here. His brother experienced it... Charles Hubbel experienced it... Even
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       experienced it! And, as I’m about to get to, there were others who experienced this despondency too...
Now, switching gears again, one common question I keep seeing people ask is, “Why would he kill himself? Gray State was set to go into production with a thirty-million-dollar budget soon!” I think that this idea comes largely from a post that my friend and liberty-musician Jordan Page made on his Facebook page, but I’m almost positive it’s not true and that Jordan made the statement in error based on some kind of misunderstanding (Jordan, if you have solid evidence that this is true, please forgive me, and please share it with us!).
First of all, while Crowley definitely HAD met with some big producers and been working towards a deal like this, to the best of my knowledge (And yes, I do have at least a LITTLE BIT of inside knowledge here), nothing had ever been made concrete. Certainly if that much money had ever been set in stone and the film had really been about to go into full-on production, it would have been announced on the Gray State page.
Secondly, the last time Crowley and I ever chatted was October 28th, 2014, when he contacted me and asked if I would be interested in producing for Pacific Northwest scenes in a potential nationwide Gray State web-series. You know what the fact that he was looking into making Gray State into a web-series tells me? That there’s almost NO WAY he had a thirty-million-dollar budget secured. If he did… Why would he have been considering a web series? In fact, just knowing that he was considering a web-series makes me think that he may well have been getting desperate to just get the project made SOME HOW even if it has to be with a budget MUCH smaller than he had originally intended..
I’m including a screen grab of this conversation, but the gist of it is just that he wanted me to potentially act as some kind of producer for a Gray State web-series in the Pacific Northwest. After he briefly mentioned this to me, he never got back to me and never wrote me again. The end of this conversation in the screen grab I’m providing is the last time I ever had contact with him. Interestingly, I learned from a random comment on a post on the “Gray State: The Rise” Facebook page that he talked with at least one other person about this Web-Series idea; a guy named Scott Forbes. I’m including a screen grab of that as well. Again, I think this is indicative of the fact that he was trying to make Gray State happen WITHOUT massive amounts of cash.

       [3/3] The final reason why I think that the idea Crowley and his family were assassinated is highly implausible is because, being one of the relatively few people who have actually READ the Gray State script, I just don’t think it was quite the threat to the establishment that many of you are making it out to be. I don’t know why anyone on my friend’s list wouldn’t believe that I’ve read the script, but in case this post get’s spread beyond my friends list and people question the veracity of my claims, I’m including screen grabs of the front page of the script AND an additional “Cheat Sheet” packet that Crowley sent me along with it.
The script is interesting, to be sure. It’s a bit messy and hard to follow at times, and whether or not the movie would have been any good would have REALLY depended on the execution (more-so than most films are), but I have to at least applaud it for being different. It is FAR weirder and more surreal than I think anyone who saw the concept trailer would have been expecting. Though there are elements of it present, it isn’t exactly the Red Dawn-esque insurgency epic that I think a lot of people were expecting. It delves into some very weird, surreal, occultish stuff. It probably could have been awesome, but it also could have devolved into an absolute mess. An interesting mess, but a mess none-the-less.
None of that is that terribly important, though, because my real point here is that the film just WASN’T the massive threat to the establishment that so many people are treating it like. At the end of the day it’s just a dystopian science fiction film. Sure, “Gray State: The Rise” (which I admittedly know less about) is a documentary, but as far as I know it was just a compilation of interviews, news footage, stuff Crowley shot at rallies and the like, and research compiled from publicly available sources. Basically, it probably wasn’t going to be all that much different than Alex Jones’ “Police State” documentaries. it’s not like we’re talking about groundbreaking investigative journalism here that was set to expose some massive secret the government doesn’t want us to know.
The Gray State script has a lot of pro-liberty themes, but I ultimately don’t see it being any more of a threat to the establishment than movies like The Matrix, V for Vendetta, or The Hunger Games are . In fact, due to the fact that those films are less esoteric, more accessible, and have clearer messages, even in the best-case scenario where Gray State secured a full thirty-million-dollar budget and Crowley executed it perfectly, I can’t see it having a bigger impact than any of those films have had. Like the three aforementioned films, I can definitely see it being enjoyed by the liberty movement and even having the potential to get open-minded people thinking and “wake them up,” but it wasn’t going to inspire a revolution. It wasn’t going to change the hearts of die-hard statists. And it DEFINITELY wasn’t going to expose some secret that the government doesn’t want us to know. It was purely a work of fiction.
Now, I really hate to speculate so much here, but since I’ve laid out all of this evidence I guess I should at least try to guess what it might mean. Unfortunately, as much as I want this to be a triple murder instead of a murder-suicide, I think that what happened is that Gray State was falling apart, Crowley was struggling financially, and between that and who knows what other factors he just snapped. I strongly suspect we will find out in the coming weeks that Gray State suffered a BIG setback, likely toward the end of October.
I hope that everyone who is following this case and speculating on it will refrain from jumping to the conclusion that David Crowley and his family were assassinated and at least CONSIDER any evidence that comes out indicating a murder/suicide. It’s incredibly tragic either way, but exponentially more so so if he really did take the lives of his wife and daughter himself. If you REALLY want justice for David Crowley and his family, and the evidence ends up pointing to a genuine murder-suicide as I personally think it already does, then you’ll try to use this senseless tragedy as a reminder to always be ready to give help to the mentally ill, and to be willing to ask for help if you yourself ever start to suffer from depression or mental illness.

       I am not convinced those trains are what you and the video author think they are. Not saying that I know you're wrong, just that the evidence presented is still pretty ambiguous. Of course, all the other militarization stuff is demonstrably and verifiably happening.

       And yes, I am well aware of predictive programming, the link you gave does not address my understanding of its function -- namely, as a cover and a reduced willingness to consider scenarios covered in fantastical fiction as real possibilities.
