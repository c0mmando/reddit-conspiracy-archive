       I know this has to be the real deal. He gets it, publishes it, it's ignored despite reducing gravity! FFS! Then weirdly he's fired from the Finnish university he was so trusted at, but easily gets a job working for Russia on classified projects. All of this makes it so obvious but it was hidden so well, I only found it by weirdly wandering through youtube somehow stumbling through and caught a brief reference of it and had to dig.

       Boeing did

       confirm it. They just said that they would be interested if there were future developments.

       It wasn't ignored by the scientific community. There were several attempts to replicate the experiment.

       From memory, I believe it was found to be an electromagnetic effect, rather than gravitational.
      </p>
      <p>
       While they (thought) they were shielding the gravity sensors from em effects, the gravity shielding effect vanishes when the experiment was done in a hard vacuum. It is most likely caused by ionized air effecting the instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interference is a common problem in this sort of research. Gravity is 10
       <sup>
        36
       </sup>
       weaker than em. This makes decoupling the two in experiments very hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, this would be an odd thing to go to so much effort to hide. It is gravitational shielding, not anti-gravity. Most of it's value would be in understanding how em and gravity couple. One of the biggest problems in fundamental physics right now.

       No it's not. There are a certain topics in science that are off limits and will get you black balled: Anti-gravity, free energy, and natural cures for diseases are most prevalent. You are not allowed to pursue these subjects in public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about this. We know for a fact that the Zero Point Energy field exists. Why is it that whenever a scientist expresses interest in harnessing energy from this field, he is a whacko or conspiracy theorist? Shouldn't free energy be at the forefront of our public scientific endeavors? Why would any area of scientific inquiry be "off limits", this goes against the fundamental principles of genuine inquiry.

       A common Faraday cage blocks out ALL EM. "Decoupling" (Not even used in the right context in his post) is fucking easy! You do the experiments in an industrial professional grade Faraday Cage and that's that.

       Umm, no it doesn't. At least as a fundamental field of any sort. Atoms have a non-zero minimum energy for a bound electron. This energy is sometimes called zero point energy, though the term is avoided since it gets misused so often.
      </p>
      <p>
       The minimum energy level is due to the electron having a wavelength and so only certain orbits are non-destructive to the wave. You will never find the electron between levels (The term quantum leap was used for this but, again fell out of favour due to misuse). You can read more about it
       <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/qnenergy.html">
        here
       </a>
       . The critical point is that n=0 makes the equation fail, and you cannot have a fractional n. Therefore the zero level energy is finite and above zero, even more so, IF you could shift the electron down to it, it would release a near infinite amount of energy. Unfortunately, it would also cause the electron to cease to exist and so violate lepton number conservation (which might be whit it doesn't happen spontaneously in nature).
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists looked into possibilities like these from a maths perspective a while ago. And many still do (I still remember spending hours in tutorials trying to find the flawed assumption in a thought experiment, that would cause the whole thing to unravel). The difference is that most of the stuff you hear about is akin to 'John Smith' from down the pub being annoyed that the national olympic synchronised swimming team wont take his belly flops seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase that comes to mind is "They laughed at Einstein. But that laughed at Bobo the Clown as well." The difference is that Einstein could back up his ideas with maths and observations, while Bobo just threw pies at you.

       . Have you ever heard the term "Quantum Ether"? It's the same thing. The Casimir Effect PROVES that ZPE is real and exists:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A phenomenon that is commonly presented as evidence for the existence of zero-point energy in vacuum is the Casimir effect, proposed in 1948 by Dutch physicist Hendrik B. G. Casimir (Philips Research), who considered the quantized electromagnetic field between a pair of grounded, neutral metal plates. The vacuum energy contains contributions from all wavelengths, except those excluded by the spacing between plates. As the plates draw together, more wavelengths are excluded and the vacuum energy decreases. The decrease in energy means there must be a force doing work on the plates as they move. This force has been measured and found to be in good agreement with the theory. However, there is still some debate on whether vacuum energy is necessary to explain the Casimir effect. Robert Jaffe of MIT argues that the Casimir force should not be considered evidence for vacuum energy, since it can be derived in QED without reference to vacuum energy by considering charge-current interactions (the radiation-reaction picture).[7]

       The point is, we should be pooling all of our resources in order to make it possible for the next Einstein to emerge. "A couple scientists looked into and say it's impossible" FUCK YOU lol.

       First off. Zero Point Energy and a Zero Point Energy Field are different things. If you are going to argue technical details, at least get the terminology correct. I agree some sort of vacuum flux likely exists, but it also seems to be a ground state (or at least stupidly stable, since we do not see any evidence of it collapsing anywhere in the observable universe.

      <p>
       In fact I studied quantum mechanics at university, so I know a fair bit about it. The difference is my focus was on the useful bits. Things like zero point energy levels are interesting, but ultimately just part of the maths to be noted.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the 'bullshit' pumped into my head. Most of it was we had to be able to derive from the base conditions, mostly the Schroedinger equation and the boundary conditions. They also spent a LOT of time teaching us how to dissect ideas to find any flaws and hidden assumptions. Particularly when dealing with quantum related effects, layman common sense will lead you astray a lot. It takes a while to learn the mistakes you are making and back that up with equations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And FYI, while extracting energy from the vacuum is generally thought impossible, it doesn't mean it is not looked at. I had to wrestle with it a number of times in tutorials. All the methods proposed have hidden assumptions that mean, while the might work on paper, once you get down to the root of it, conservation of energy is maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who get mocked and laughed at are the ones that come out with theories that are regularly examined by physics undergrads and proven false. If someone came out with a mathematically rigorous way of vacuum energy extraction they would definitely be taken seriously.

       Sadly there is often a bit of the Dunning-Kruger effect taking place. A lot of people misunderstand 'not common sense' with 'anything possible' and hey presto, magic works.

       I wonder if it's psychological. The same people that would cling to religion for comfort and bend their perspective of the universe to fit their ideals, without religion, might turn to pseudo science and outlying theories for the same reason and effect.

       I think it is more akin to the way old map makers put 'here be dragons' 'here be sea monsters' etc. The human mind does not like unknowns, but also knows that new solutions can hide within them. It makes people want to fill in the gaps with what they hope is there.

       Religion relies on this effect, but it is not exclusive to religion. We are all prone to it. It is the reason that science relies on duplication and maths so much.

       Free energy is a joke, it doesn't exist. If you can pull it off, and you'll have to do it without funding because everyone knows it's a joke, you can bathe in more money than you can imagine.

       Natural cures are garbage, for the most part. Refined, tested and effective "natural" cures are known as medicine. The natural cures comes with whatever stuff is also inside the plant, bug or thing you find it in. Completely unnecessary. Much better to identify the active ingredients and use those only.

       THIS IS WHAT I DONT FUCKING GET! I understand it's impossible right now but we
       <em>
        know for a fact
       </em>
       that there is an unlimited energy resource called the Zero Point Field but, as a society, we've come to the point where we immediately say "Never gonna happen. What a joke." Why? We are standing on the shore of a new ocean and everyone's saying "There's no way you could ever build a boat."
      </p>
      <p>
       In our society, why aren't we encouraging all YOUNG SCIENTISTS to pursue free energy. Why aren't we funding research, discovering ways to tap it and putting all our efforts into engineering the field? I'll tell you why: It would make oil obsolete and would level the playing field for everyone. We'd cross over into an era of abundance, not scarcity. And that won't be allowed to happen as long as the New World Order psychos are in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of ENCOURAGING young people and scientists to tackle the big problems that are impossible right now (but won't be tomorrow), we have a whole nation of deluded, self-defeating morons saying "That's a joke! Never gonna happen!"
      </p>
      <p>
       You think it's a fucking joke moron? How many knuckle draggers like you told the Wright brothers that flight was a joke before they made the first plane? How many morons like you told Turing the Enigma code was unbreakable before he broke it? Impossible is nothing. Impossible only becomes a fact when ignorance and apathy make you take the easy way out.

       Just, and you're telling a lot, but try to consider that if free energy was easy to access then the whole universe would be a giant fireball. Why? Because if energy was easy to release then something, eventually, over the course of the last 14 billion years would have released it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fusion is a promising area of research and is, in essence, harnessing the energy that is basically everywhere locked within matter. But to get a fusion reactor running requires extremely precise equipment and a very deep understanding of physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps think less about "free energy" and more about "freer energy".

       An unlimited source of energy eh? Proposed by some guy who thought there could be an alternative explanation to an existing theory. He couldn't prove himself right but you held on because he couldn't be proved wrong either. Followers of this theory would be driven by the desire for comfort knowing there was unlimited energy in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what you sound like? A religious nut who wants the comfort of a deity with unlimited power looking over them. Who can't be disproven because he's invisible, who is simply proposed by goat herders who had alternative theories to what made the sun go up and down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your position is completely parallel, the burden of proof lies on your head, and unlimited energy is just as implausible as a deity. Who made god and his unlimited power? Who made unlimited energy and stored it in a field of infinite capacity?
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like you like your conspiracies. Hedge a bet on enough implausible things and some day you might have been the hipster who believed in something early right? I recommend you hedge your bets elsewhere.

       Is there any physical evidence that you can point to that proves a deity exists? Because the Casimir Effect is physical proof that the Zero Point Field exists. We know for a fact that it is physically in the background at all times. It was Richard Feynman that said that (paraphrasing from his book): "There is enough energy in a cup of coffee to power the whole world for a year."

       You are the one that is making it sound esoteric and religious. I am just talking about a physical field of energy that we can experimentally know is sitting right here in front of us. I never mentioned religion once, you did.

       Sure I've got proof. The tide goes in the tide goes out. You can't explain that. Well, maybe their are some more popular theories about why the tide goes in and out but it could just as well be God and you can't disprove that if he's there making it move the same as if it were other forces.

      <p>
       That's what it looks like you're doing. And yes, there is enough energy in a cup of coffee to power the world: and enough in your body to blow up the world. That's simply the Electromagnetic and nuclear strong forces and matter. If you could convert the matter and bonding energies all in to free energy, EM waves, light, you could blow up the planet with a cup of coffee. Your point?

       , you're doing great work and sharing excellent information, BUT you do come across as a little over the top. I sense you are quite emotionally invested in the free energy discussion, and your emotion is spilling out into your comments. I don't blame you for that at all.

       HOWEVER, you're doing yourself a disservice. People with conflicting opinions will see that you're shouting insults at them, and they'll do what people naturally do - simply ignore you and marginalize you in their minds as batshit insane. It is in our nature to do this. Please understand this, and exercise more restraint in the future when posting. You can change minds with kindness. You'll only create more stubborn, ignorant fools with anger and frustration.

       It's not that it's off limits, but that we've already repeatedly tested it, and found it not to be possible. Because of this, anyone who still looks into it is seen a hopelessly repeating failed experiments in the hope it works (hint: it won't). That or they're con men (equally likely, especially if they as for funding/try and sell the machine)

       Alright suppose superconductors can be practical household items. This so here's is nowhere with OPs article since as the other user pointed out the experiment didn't work in a vacuum, meaning the EM was just ionising the air. No gravity manipulation.

       An MRI will easily fit in a standard shipping container; put it on the back of a semi and it will go anywhere. And of course the superconductor and cooling unit don't make up most of the volume of an MRI - those parts will probably fit in a pickup truck. Add a generator or two and you're done.
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize that the military and various other groups routinely deploy mobile energy-intensive devices and equipment, from lasers to comm stations to data centers? I don't see why this would be any different.

       The magnet absolutely makes up the bulk of the MRI. So it can be shipped. Can the truck carrying it afford to have it assembled,  power it, and sacrifice cargo space? All to shave a percent off the weight of casting the bloody contraption? All for a science that won't work in a container anyway considering it's manipulating air not gravity as pointed out in the top comment.

       What about superconductors? We haven't had a problem so far passing by large objects. We've even used them and their gravity as slingshots to accelerate our satellites. Orbiting then isn't a problem. People on the ISS don't seem to be experiencing any forces of gravity.

       All this damn theory and testing. Man they are just chewing thru cash and airtime getting everyone's idea of wtf is there. They need to drive down to a home depot in usa pick up a truck bed full of Mexicans and hand them shovels.

       I remember back in 95 maybe seeing a report on the MSM on tv that they discovered antigrav. Something to do with spinning, cryogenic metal oxide ceramic discs that reduced the force of gravity by 2% per disk in the stack. Never found anything about it again. I remember it clearly.

         It takes enormous amounts of energy to keep superconductors hundreds of degrees below freezing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fast vehicles traveling hundreds of kilometres per hour don't care about gravity much. The land vehicles care about friction, sure. Hovering reduces friction with the ground which is a retarding force. The big obstacle however is friction with the air. A hovering quantum locked train still has to deal with all the wind resistance a regular train does. In fact air resistance increases exponentially so if the hover train goes faster it needs even way more energy to push through the air, not to mention needs jet engines or something since ground friction is how trains usually propel themselves in the first place.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Basically you've just thought up an existing maglev train that requires way more energy to operate due to near absolute zero superconductors.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could magically remove gravity, airliners would thank you during their takeoff manoeuvres and acid you during landing. NASA would have easier rocket launches, though quantum locking isn't exactly going to work at multiple heights.

       If he ever could have done it with something weighing say 50 kilograms he would have something impressive. Otherwise he just spent several decades tinkering around with ionic wind effects, not anti-gravity, with no significant results to speak of.

       of research to catch up on.

       Go get Brown's biography, or better yet, read the summary I prepared for

       here's some more leads on anti-gravity (none of which involve stupid worthless superconductors):

       honestly your best bet is to use extremely low frequency radio waves. perhaps ultra-low width e.l.f waves. that's the kinda shit that andrija puharich was working with when trying to measure the energy coming out of uri geller's hands whenever he'd melt the shit out of a spoon or get inside people's heads and shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as superconductors go though.. here's something of interest in that regard:

       The military are just as capable as being initially taken in by stage magic as any rubes. Later on when they realise it's been trickery it would be sensible to continue looking as if there was more to it, and letting the information to leak out, as opposing governments might waste money trying to research similar "amazing" results.

       Anti-gravity is the one technology that we will have to fight for tooth and nail. The rulers on this planet do not want us off the planet and our cousins in space certainly don't want us off this planet.

       So as soon as it got out that his paper/experiment claimed to have lessened gravity by 2% he gets kicked out of his lab and fired from his employment at the university.

       Wow...Apparently anti-gravity is one of the several things the technology gate keepers do not allow.

       Attaching a helium balloon to it would also possible lessen the weight by a similarly small amount, but wouldn't be regarded as anti-gravity.

       And you wouldn't even need a power source for that.

       Because it's likely being edited by people with qualifications from University of Googling, who likely don't understand how the content of an encyclopaedia needs to be cited, and then being reverted back again by admins.
