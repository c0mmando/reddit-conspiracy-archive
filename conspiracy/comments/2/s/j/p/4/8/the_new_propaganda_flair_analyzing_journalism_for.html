       Good afternoon everybody. Here's a new Event that could take the media by storm, as it furthers this
       <em>
        narrative
       </em>
       of Islamic Extremism is a problem, and there are a few memes that have been propagating lately. First, here's the story and link:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        CNN Report: Two killed in Belgian anti-terror operation
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/15/world/belgium-anti-terror-operation/index.html">
        http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/15/world/belgium-anti-terror-operation/index.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, a lot of users here have seen this type of thing and how the source videos really don't display what the media newspeople say it displays. So let's talk about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've asked the mods to flair this post as 'Propaganda,' and if the community likes this maybe this could be something a few of us can do and see where it takes us. I'll post a few comments throughout the evening of stories related to the Belgian raid, as well as any source videos I find (and I encourage you all to do the same), as well as back-up and archive any sources you want to post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's see what happens. Remember - if something you read
       <em>
        tells you something happened
       </em>
       , it is up to you to try and source the claim. Some sort of
       <em>
        meta-journalism
       </em>
       , mayhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good talk. See you out there.
      </p>
      <p>

       I like the idea of a propaganda flair.  I don't think people realize how pervasive it is.  I support anything that helps people to understand better how they are being manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we can convince
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       to use your propaganda tag on this:

       This whole "american sniper" feel sorry for the traumatized troops meme is just the government playing the pity card.  How about you rich assholes not put innocent people who don't know any better into these situations in the first place?  anyways, didn't want to hijack your post.. was just browsing videos.

       Something that was also quietly passed this week was the Terrorism 
Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act or
       <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr26/BILLS-114hr26enr.pdf">
        HR 26
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a CNN
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/17/politics/coburn-terrorism-risk-insurance-act/">
        analysis
       </a>
       of the act from December of 2014 that was killed at the end of the last session, before being reintroduced and passed largely unchanged (proof of political theater):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Coburn opposed a specific rider made to what would have been a six-year extension of the act. Called the
        <strong>
         National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, it would create a federal bureaucracy built to license insurance agents
        </strong>
        . Coburn wanted an opt-out provision for states, and he disagreed with the length of the extension.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yeah.. That made it in. It's 1/3 of the bill. I encourage you all to read it.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Coburn said further that TRIA forces American taxpayers to "take all the risk." He said on the Senate floor Tuesday that the insurance industry has made $40 billion as a result of TRIA in the last 12 years.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That would mean there was
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       $40 billion dollars worth of damage/loss due to "terrorist attacks" since 9/11, no? I wonder if we can FOIA the shit out of the reports for TRIA...

       My take from the CNN article:
       <strong>
        Terrorists are fucking everywhere.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people in certain countries travel to Syria, probably to see their family or whatever during a major crisis. Now, they have overly-paranoid governments watching their every move upon return. What horseshit.

       I like the idea for obvious cases such as this. I dunno who makes that determination for the fuzzy cases -- think Ben Fulford, David Icke, even Alex Jones. But simply calling out the big boys such as CNN, BBC, MSNBC, etc. seems like a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The downside is that it'll lead to more posts that are propaganda, so a bit more noise, but maybe that'll help people learn to recognize propaganda (and point &amp; laugh) in their offline life.
