        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Good afternoon everybody. Here&#39;s a new Event that could take the media by storm, as it furthers this <em>narrative</em> of Islamic Extremism is a problem, and there are a few memes that have been propagating lately. First, here&#39;s the story and link:</p>

<p><strong>CNN Report: Two killed in Belgian anti-terror operation</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/15/world/belgium-anti-terror-operation/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/15/world/belgium-anti-terror-operation/index.html</a></p>

<p>Now, a lot of users here have seen this type of thing and how the source videos really don&#39;t display what the media newspeople say it displays. So let&#39;s talk about it?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked the mods to flair this post as &#39;Propaganda,&#39; and if the community likes this maybe this could be something a few of us can do and see where it takes us. I&#39;ll post a few comments throughout the evening of stories related to the Belgian raid, as well as any source videos I find (and I encourage you all to do the same), as well as back-up and archive any sources you want to post.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what happens. Remember - if something you read <em>tells you something happened</em>, it is up to you to try and source the claim. Some sort of <em>meta-journalism</em>, mayhaps.</p>

<p>Good talk. See you out there.</p>

<p>-Jim</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the idea of a propaganda flair.  I don&#39;t think people realize how pervasive it is.  I support anything that helps people to understand better how they are being manipulated.</p>

<p>Maybe we can convince <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> to use your propaganda tag on this:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y_a_V1QD3U&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y_a_V1QD3U&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>This whole &quot;american sniper&quot; feel sorry for the traumatized troops meme is just the government playing the pity card.  How about you rich assholes not put innocent people who don&#39;t know any better into these situations in the first place?  anyways, didn&#39;t want to hijack your post.. was just browsing videos.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that was also quietly passed this week was the Terrorism 
Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act or <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr26/BILLS-114hr26enr.pdf">HR 26</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/17/politics/coburn-terrorism-risk-insurance-act/">analysis</a> of the act from December of 2014 that was killed at the end of the last session, before being reintroduced and passed largely unchanged (proof of political theater):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coburn opposed a specific rider made to what would have been a six-year extension of the act. Called the <strong>National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, it would create a federal bureaucracy built to license insurance agents</strong>. Coburn wanted an opt-out provision for states, and he disagreed with the length of the extension.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.. That made it in. It&#39;s 1/3 of the bill. I encourage you all to read it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Coburn said further that TRIA forces American taxpayers to &quot;take all the risk.&quot; He said on the Senate floor Tuesday that the insurance industry has made $40 billion as a result of TRIA in the last 12 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would mean there was <em>at least</em> $40 billion dollars worth of damage/loss due to &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; since 9/11, no? I wonder if we can FOIA the shit out of the reports for TRIA...</p>

<p>Some people in certain countries travel to Syria, probably to see their family or whatever during a major crisis. Now, they have overly-paranoid governments watching their every move upon return. What horseshit. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30840160">BBC</a></p>

<p>Magistrate Eric Van der Sypt told reporters police had targeted <strong>a group returning from Syria who had been about to launch &quot;large-scale&quot; attacks</strong>.</p>

<p>Suspects had opened fire on police with assault weapons, he said.</p>

<p><a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/15/belgium-terror-raid.html">Al Jazeera English</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>RTBF said the operation was part of a <strong>nationwide sweep against suspected “Islamist groups,” including people believed to have returned to Belgium after taking part in the Syrian civil war</strong>. Similar raids occurred in Brussels as well as Molenbeek, according to that town’s mayor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/15/3-reportedly-killed-in-counter-terrorism-raid-in-belgium/">Fox News</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police stopped a &quot;Belgian Charlie Hebdo&quot; late Thursday, with government agents killing at least two in raids aimed at jihadists <strong>returning from Syria</strong> who were planning to launch terrorist attacks &quot;on a grand scale&quot;, according to prosecutors.</p>

<p>The raids included one on an apartment above a bakery in the eastern city of Verviers, authorities said. They said no officers were injured and that <strong>the suspects opened fire on them as the swooped in</strong>. </p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ve averted a Belgian Charlie Hebdo,&quot; an unidentified police officer told La Meuse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Belga news agency quoted officials as saying the targets of the raid had been under surveillance since recently returning from Syria. It said there were several casualties and that police activity was continuing.</p>

<p>Ahmed Hirsi says his 20-year-old son, Mahad, <strong>was killed last fall</strong> along with cousins Hamsa and Hersi Kariye.</p>

<p>Another cousin from Minnesota, Hanad Abdullahi Mohallim, was also killed, Hirsi said.</p>

<p><strong>Other family members deny the men died while fighting for ISIS</strong>, but Hirsi insists it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>He said his son and two nephews <strong>left Edmonton without telling him in October 2013</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Some members of the cell had traveled to Syria and met with ISIS</strong>, which plotted the attacks as retaliation for U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria and Iraq, <strong>the Belgian source said</strong>.</p>
