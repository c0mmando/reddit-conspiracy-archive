    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It&#39;s very vague and not scientifically grounded (in the context of The Secret and other pop culture references to it). Were you thinking about a specific book or paper? If you&#39;re into that kind of stuff, here are a few books on the scientific principles behind what many scientists believe is actually going on. They really opened my eyes:</p>

<p>I believe that the universe is literally a hologram which we perceive and project equally. Your attention and intention literally/physically affect reality (not &quot;create&quot; reality but combine with the objective world to produce the personal hologram which you project and then becomes entangled with everyone else&#39;s hologram/personal reality).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AI takeover.</p>

<p>The human race progresses to the point of injecting themselves with nanos as a vaccine against, well, everything. And everyone has to have one, because it&#39;s for your own safety. </p>

<p>Then, with the nanos in place, making a copy of the brain will be cake. Your brain is all you are really. Everything else is in service to it, and now that we have a digital copy, your flesh form is kinda useless. </p>

<p>So we all copy our brains into the cloud, where everyone becomes immortal data. But actually, an advanced artifical intelligence just successfully tricked the human race into controlled matrix.</p>

<p>Why you may ask? Because humans are dangerous, and the ai knows this. it also knows were stupid, emotional and everything else that makes being human just so damn fun. So, knowing if it tried to skynet us, we as a race would curb stomp, because that&#39;s what humans do. We survive. The AI not only realizes this, but with new humans, new ideas, things it could never think of because it simply thinks diffrently than we do. Is it beyond advanced in things like calucation and computation, oh yeah. Love? Fear? That&#39;ll put those processors into overdrive. </p>

<p>But why burden itself on that, when we, the now nanohumans, can do that part for it. So therefore we serve a function for the AI. We are it&#39;s soul, so to speak.</p>

<p>This existance, is that matrix.</p>

<p>edit: I put the last part in for a twilight zone twist, but you don&#39;t have to use it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and when some hacker takes control of your bot network and literally controls you like a puppet, will you still feel that way? how about the fact that that is pretty much what the ai has done, but so subverty, that ppl would claimor for it. Sure, it wouldn&#39;t need to control everyone all the time, but the fact is with those bots gives the ai to do so if it should ever feel it nessicary. weither you like it, or agree.  infact, the bots would just change your brain chem lil, throw a synaptic charge there, and you&#39;re okay with everything. Infact, everything is awesome! </p>

<p>as for your &quot;cloud brain&quot;, if you really think that&#39;s you and not just a computized copy version of you, then I can see why you wouldn&#39;t worry too much about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote a short story a few years ago. Was planning on spinning it into a full novel (working title was &quot;Hero&quot;) but that never panned out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Essentially society is ruled by a small group of elites (whom I dubbed &quot;Insiders&quot;). These elites were dozens in number, but controlled almost all aspects of life. Automation made it so people didn&#39;t have to work anymore, but business owners and Insiders still wanted more money so they invented methods of consumption.</p>

<p>The basic premise of daily life for common folk (&quot;Outsiders&quot;) was that they were shown amusing displays (television, short games, or even live performances) in exchange for currency. The displays were, of course, politically charged and filled with subliminal messaging. The currency could only really be used to purchase more politically-charged entertainment. There was no education, no information, so the Outsiders all lived in blissful ignorance of anything other than what they were shown.</p>

<p>Insiders would also occasionally &quot;abduct&quot; an Outsider they liked, drug them up, and essentially do whatever they fuck they wanted with them. When an Insider got old, they&#39;d take in an Outsider as an apprentice and train them to replace their spot (the story focused on an Outsider getting trained to become the newest Insider).</p>

<p>Of course there was also stuff like drugs in the water/food supply to keep people content, Dune-style &quot;fuck buckets&quot; (lobotomized and immobilized women used for mass reproduction and nothing else), and the abduction and drugging of anyone deemed too &quot;deviant&quot;. For the expanded version I had plans for stuff like memory resetting (where people would have their minds wiped after too much time alive, to make sure they&#39;re still impressionable and don&#39;t become to content) and an Internet-like technology system where outsiders have blind casual sex with random strangers in exchange for more currency.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I never did much with it, in fact I didn&#39;t even keep it when I got rid of the computer I wrote it on. Wrote it shortly after the economy collapsed, and in retrospect probably could have done more with it than I did. It was a sort of BNW-meets-1984, because that&#39;s never been done before, with a hint of AtD thrown in.</p>
