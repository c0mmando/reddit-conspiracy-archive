       can't natural alternative meds be our choice? i understand the pharms want the money, but "f" them, a persons decision to choose a medication (without side effects) seems sane to me.

       Do you listen to Stefan Molyneux?  In certain states, if you need to give illegal cannabis oil to your child to keep them alive you can still be arrested, and then seperated froom your child and thrown in jail. So you can't just say that you chose to be free and then the won't throw you in jail.

       Ok, I thought you were a molyneux cult follower. You sound like a robot, have a real conversation. I'm saying you can say your free, but you can still get thrown in jail. You make it seem like you can just say "I'm free now" and then the laws won't apply to you.

       File a motion to dismiss charges for lack of standing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that doesn't work, I'd get out on bail within the day and the moment I see the cop for arraignment I'd have his testimony dismissed immediately. If the judge were to take the dismissed testimony then I'd have a due process error. Which means a slam dunk appeal.

       Standing requires an injury and the violation of a legal right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no one claiming injury. No one is claiming the violation of a right. There is a witness, the cop, but the cop has claimed none of these things. The prosecutor will represent the state, but even the prosecutor will not be claiming injury or the violation of a right.

       For them to proceed would be to breech their own rules. I know they do this every day, but with me they won't have any free passes. I'll set up every due process violation possible and ensure a slam dunk appeal.

       Who's claiming that I've injured them? Who's claiming that I violated a right of theirs? The cop is not the plaintiff. The cop is a witness. Prosecution is not the plaintiff. Prosecution is representing the state. Without the antagonistic assertion of a right there is no standing. No injury - no crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, yes, I would absolutely bring that up during pre-trial and arraignment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they violate due process the decision is completely reversible.

       My first question was of cannabis oil. But my main point is arguing against when you said being free is your own choice. So you can't be free if you want to kill people and not go to jail?

       You know when you're acting like an asshole. It's called empathy. If you've hurt someone you'll know it and you'll feel bad about it. Every six year old knows that hitting people is wrong. If you really need someone to explain to you why hitting an innocent person is bad I don't really know what to say other than you're pretty fucked up.

       I have a friend. Let's call her Betty. Betty was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. The doctors gave her six months to live. Betty had never been a pot smoker, but took it up as a means of pain management and to not have to take so much medication. Betty's cancer went into remission about a year and a half later. Now she was still doing chemotherapy, and im not trying to paint pot as a means to cure cancer, but this is just another example of someone who was supposed to die and after taking up pot and doing her chemotherapy along with it had it remiss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Betty feels as though the occasional usage of cannabis oil will help her cancer stay in remission. We had a motion to pass medical pot back in November here in Florida and Betty was devastated when it didn't pass by 2%.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a pothead trying to get high, this is a person who wants to live to see her grandson graduate high school.

       Same reason less and less of us are allowed to grow our own food, it's like printing your own money! Imagine GROWING your own medicine, who would profit from that? Definitely not the greedy big pharma fat cats who want to get fatter off of your hard earned money and unnecessary suffering. We need to stop the practice of putting corporations and shareholders ahead of people and the planet we call home. But that won't happen until we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of the lies, deception and death, but THAT won't happen as long as there are more people interested in buying the new Iphone or watching WorldStar than there are people wanting to end the madness. Why would they? In a sane world Iphones wouldn't be so exclusive and WorldStar wouldn't even exist. How would they entertain themselves then?

       It's a work in progress. Many states have laws that allow it to be used medically. With a doctors referral and state fees of course. Then comes many laws as to where and how it can be used, grown, as well as distribution if allowed. Each state verys in what they ask. I know of Colorado as well as Washington has legalized it to be used recreationally by adults 21 and over. As well as comes similar laws. People are getting more open to it as well as more knowledgeable.

       I live in eastern wa and they allow 15 plants and a little over a pound or dried and cured at any given time as your personal "stash". On your person you can have I think an ounce and your OK anything over that is considered intention to sell i believe. Same rules as alcohol, can't be in public, must be 21 etc. Keep in mind you can only have plants if you have a medical card witch is around 200 bucks a year to grow and all that. Me and my buddies did an outdoor crop this summer of some og purp clones. Turned out okay it ain't no Cali bud but it's cool. Lol love the new laws in place for us smokers!

      <p>
       See...articles like this make me more skeptical rather than less.  Claiming that organic lemons (no mention of dosage or how to best take them) are 1,000,000 time stronger (10000*100) than chemotherapy drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, lemon's 'potent antimicrobial properties' are, for the most part, a result of its relatively extreme pH, so neutralizing that with baking soda probably wouldn't increase its potency, as the article suggests.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm 100% ready to believe that there alternative methods/chemicals out there...but why can't anyone be reasonable about their efficacy?

      <p>
       I 100% agree with you there.  My issue w/ the alternative movement though (as I usually see it on the internet at least), is that everyone assumes that since doctors are pushing drugs, that everything they say
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       to do is actually even better because doctors just don't actually want people to get better.

       And the atlantic article is actually really interesting.  There is a lot of talk about how inappropriate antibiotic regimens lead to immunity in harmful strains, but nobody ever really thinks about their effect on beneficial strains who are vulnerable for the exact same reasons in many cases.  The thought that there might have been key bacterial species helping to keep people healthy throughout human history that were simply destroyed with the advent of antibiotics is kind of scary actually.  If anyone could prove this (if you could find a way to prove the existence of an extinct species of bacteria...) it would change the entire discussion about why people seem to get more of certain types of illnesses more often than has been seen (or at least recorded) throughout history.

       Here a redditor who's been growing this herb illegaly for over a decade in the netherlands, I feel like a jew in a concentration camp, can't talk about it with anyone, I pay for my electricity aswell (which is a major risk! --&gt; police conducting tests on electrical grid to see patterns of 12/12 or 18/6 (numbers meaning hours of light/dark, using grow lights of 600 watts each (got 5 of em).(hallalujah for "smart" meters...)
      </p>
      <p>
       On television good citizens are required to call in tips annonymously, which systems in inherently corrupt, since a "tip" is enough here to search your entire house and reports keep these tips annonymous, which suggests cops/investigators can call these "tips" in themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       90% of the weed-busts in the netherlands are made due to these tips.
      </p>
      <p>
       These is only 1 upside of all this, I can sell weed here up to 5000/7000 euro's per kilo, this wouldn't be possible if weed were legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you rent a house from the "social projects" which are alllllot of houses in the netherlands, and you decide to grow a few plants, you'll end up being envicted of your house, new legislation also gives mayers/police the autority to close down bought houses if residents get caught growing and even get their loan with the bank removed.
(on a few reasons, 1 being the loan being credited on false paperwork, which is a good thing)---but also affect "normal" people growing a few plants how ? a rule of the loan is that you keep the house livable during the loan contract, but if the mayor of your town decide to close down your house, putting wood over your windows and door(for 3 months, the 1st time you get caugt, 6 months second,ect), you violate the contract with the bank ---&gt; same effect of losing your loan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also massive privacy infrigements are commited to search for these grow ops, I see a few helicopters with thermal equipment per week scanning houses for abnormal heat dissapation (grow lights get hot), If we all bitch about the security agencies scanning data even of people who aren't guilty, then how come we can allow all these helicopters flying over innocent homes, actively scanning them ? (people here say, "got nothing to hide so I don't care..yet they still close the curtains at night)
      </p>
      <p>
       I make Oil aswell out of the smaller buds and leaf material, its considered here in the netherlands a felony of making a class 1 drug (harddrug!) and get up to 6 years for making it..
      </p>
      <p>
       Netherlands also wants to put in laws to banish weed over 15% THC (which is highly controversial, because it lacks evidence providing THC levels over 15% to be harmfull)
      </p>
      <p>
       coming march the 1st, a new anti-marijhana law will be enforced (its voted for and accepted) which is verrrrry anti "democratic and free".
      </p>
      <p>
       You will held complicit if you inform, sell, help, whatever a grower.
If a urban grow store knows your gonna use the equipment for a weed grow, hes also made a complicitor by law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basicly closing down internet forums about weed growing, since providing info about weed gets you convicted the same as the one you gave the info to.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a massssssive war on cannabis here in the netherlands.

       I interned for an unnamed Big Pharma company. 
On the first day I asked the senior scientists of they thought there would ever be a cure for AIDS. They laughed and said "...money is in
       <em>
        maintenance
       </em>
       -not in cures!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I quickly left the industry after that summer.

       Standing requires an injury and the violation of a legal right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no one claiming injury. No one is claiming the violation of a right. There is a witness, the cop, but the cop has claimed none of these things. The prosecutor will represent the state, but even the prosecutor will not be claiming injury or the violation of a right.
      </p>
      <p>
       For them to proceed would be to breech their own rules. I know they do this every day, but with me they won't have any free passes. I'll set up every due process violation possible and ensure a slam dunk appeal.
