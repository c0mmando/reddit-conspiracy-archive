       I'm new here, but I've been reading a lot through this sub, and the information presented here is outstanding. I've been introduced to ideas that have been very well presented. I've seen users who obviously have a wide vocabulary, and present arguments well. I like that there is heated debate amongst the subs users.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my question is just to see how deep the rabbit hole goes for some people. As there are a lot of knowledgeable people around here who do immaculate research I'm just curious as to what you guys find hard to believe amongst the claims of conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Thanks a lot for all the responses. I had a lot of good reading today. Much appreciated!

       nibiru right? I don't think there was ever a shred of legitimacy to that one. Most theories have some sort of nugget of truth behind them, but that one was just complete bunk.

       I always thought that was disinfo by the Masons. The nugget of truth is that they really believe in the Black Sun and that our solar system is part of a binary star system and that our sun's companion is a dead neutron star.

       I've heard that a lot of these "prophecies" are self fulfilled. Which to me means that someone way back in the day wrote down "x is going to happen". And now someone says "how do we go about making x happen?" is that right?

       This is why biblical prophesies (and other superstitious beliefs) cannot be dismissed out of hand - not because they have value, but because millions attribute value to them. Religious fanatics can be very driven towards "facilitating" prophesies, and some of them even hold positions of power.

       A lot of users already brought up good ones, but Geocentrism is one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly, the rabbit hole goes deep. Like real deep. It doesnt matter the topic, it only matters on how much time you are willing to invest to go down any particular path. What most of us have done is focused on a main topic we liked, dug deep, and slowly sprawled our roots through the ground into other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually youll notice a lot of conspiracies are connected, and then all of a sudden everything gets deeper again.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just remember to keep an open mind. Entertain ideas without attributing your own beliefs towards the ideas, and even the most outlandish theories can teach you something...

       The glass sky/hollow earth stuff is hard. Some of it seems kind of neat, but the proofs always come from some bizarre reasoning as this is not really something that can be easily proved.
      </p>

       The guy Stephen Christ on youtube does some really detailed drawings about his ideas but when it comes down to it they're all just based on his imagination.

       I'm not huge into it but my laymans understanding is that there are two main groups. One who thinks the earth is a hollow sphere and things/beings live inside. The other theory is that we actually live inside the earth and what we see as the sky is actually a sphere suspended in the center.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first theory seems more logical from a physical point of view, but I've actually found the second theory to be more compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look up Lord Stephen Christ on youtube he has hours upon hours of videos of him talking about this stuff. SOme of it is actually neat and he uses quotes from the bible and recent NASA discoveries (like the plasma 'wall' around earth) to try and support his theory, but he also says he does astral projection and stuff to figure some of it out too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not the most believable stuff but it's fun.

       He released a book with the coordinates of all the DUMB bases throughout the US and world and then committed "suicide" after telling his ex wife he never would. His ex wife also came out with info that can be found at rense.com.

       There were 2 other guys that came out to blow the whistle on Dulce. One guy's name is Thomas Castello and he released pictures he smuggled out of the Dulce base. Can't find a link to the original interview with a guy that called himself "Branton". The top search on Google only brings up drawings which are NOT the original Dulce papers. Found it actually:
       <a href="http://www.crowdedskies.com/files/The%20A%20DULCE%20BASE%20SECURITY%20OFFICER%20SPEAKS%20OUT.pdf">

       </a>
       And here's an interview:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gSKPz52cVw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gSKPz52cVw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The other Dulce whistleblower is Captain Mark Richards who is in jail for murder (says he was framed). He claims he was part of a group of guards that decided too much fucked up shit was going on and turned on the people running the base. This (supposedly) what started the Dulce war (he heard about Phil Schneider and what was going on and had to react to it). He was interviewed for the first time in decades only a few years ago:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bPhG3WP2xM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bPhG3WP2xM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After the fact, a guy named Paul Bennewicz tried to disclose the Dulce war to the public and paid the price for it. His story is the basis for the documentary Mirage Men in which a coordinated disinformation plot burnt Bennewicz out to the point he killed himself. But Mirage Men never even considers the fact that Dulce could have been real and never even mentions Schneider, Castello, or Richards (the guy's who got Bennewicz interested in the first place).

      </p>
      <p>
       The Dulce War is highly controversial obviously and the only evidence we have are the stories and pictures of the original first hand witnesses (Schneider, Castello, and Richards). Schneider also had many artifacts that he took from the base but they disappeared after his death. There is an amazing book on it by Mark Richards wife that is available here:

       Well to be fair the fact this may of happened decades ago is still chilling, but doesn't take away sleep. It's believable for sure, but isn't evident enough to have me building a tin foil hat.

       Its sort of like living in a novel to entertain these thoughts. The fact that there is a sliver of a chance that this may be real has me thinking we live in some sort of crazy story. If this is the under cover narrative then when it is brought public (if at all). It will surely change the way we think about society.

       The argument is not that all vaccines are bad, but that most are unnecessary and do harmful damage to the immune system. Also, it is argued that vaccines are intentionally tainted with chemicals to reduce intelligence and other bodily function.

      <p>
       Some of that is shillage, but most of it comes down to the nature of the wide variety of topics discussed on this forum. It's going to be divisive because by nature most people are not going to go into as much depth into subject A as someone else does on subject B, thus there will be differences in opinion.

      <p>
       I guess it could be considered the same. But "all vaccines are bad" is a very simplistic statement. There is evidence different vaccines are bad for different reasons, not that they are all equally bad across the board...not necessarily.

       "Plant the seed". Send operatives to al Qaeda. Tell them, "Hey, if you flew planes into the WTC, it would really fuck the USA up." Maybe give them some money to fund the op.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then sit back and wait. When you see people linked to al Qaeda enter the country and attend flight school, have an "intelligence failure". When you hear reports that they don't seem to care much about  landing, another "intelligence failure".
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all they needed to do. Al Qaeda already had, still has, a large enough number of disillusioned young men who truly believe that if they martyr themselves killing Americans, their prophet/pimp will hook them up with a dozen hot &amp; horny virgins in heaven, and they sure as hell aren't getting any of those here on Earth. They had the infrastructure and ability and desire to pull it off. They just needed to be pointed in the right direction.

       I don't believe that UFOs are ETs. Not that I don't believe there are ETs or UFOs, I just can't accept that a civilization with thousands of years of technological development over us would be using such basic technology, sneaking around, doing flybys, abiding a galactic treaty of 'non intervention', etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       ETs could be anything. Considering we're on the cusp of developing or have already developed in secret remote mind-control technologies, then of course evolved ETs would have that. Of course they would have all their bidding done on earth through such a process. That is, if they cared at all. I doubt they could be bothered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course they would see humanity and the pain that it is in. Of course they would help if that meant anything to them. It's ridiculous that they would refrain from helping us with technology because there's some special rule that any evolving species has to work everything out themselves like Star Trek.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever built the pyramids had no qualms about encoding universal truths into the structure either to support the function of whatever the pyramids are or as a kind of memorial beacon, an educational curiosity for future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the UFOs we see, I believe, are human or at least created by beings who share this part of the universe with us. Somewhere, there is an incredible cache of ancient technological artifacts that must have inevitably been discovered and accumulated by the reigning powers over the years. Perhaps those technologies were sufficiently advanced to allow a group of people to break away from ordinary humanity and embark on their own advanced stream of technological development.

       The whole government mind control by deploying Extremely Low Frequency waves through communication devices (phones, radio, television, cell phone towers, govt vans with dishes) that alter brain alpha waves. I personally don't think you can get actual results in behavioral or thought control from simple sound waves. Conspiracy sites were rampant with ELF theories after the Navy Yard shooting and I couldn't buy any of it.

       It's not a movie about conspiracies. And its not a total Hollywood production. Its more like a scifi horror dark comedy flick. Here's the link:

       Love this site. He just added a huge section about the concave earth with tons of historical oddities and even a movie from 1943 of a still living wooly mammoth!

       Great stuff. If you are looking to blow your mind, go here first.

       That George Zimmerman was an agent of Dick Cheney who was tasked with killing someone to acquire him a heart to be used as a base for his new one to be cloned from. That someone was Trayvon Martin.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is claimed elites at Cheney's level possess organ cloning tech that uses an existing heart to grow them a new one from their cells, a process that takes a certain number of days, I forget the exact number, but that number happened to be the same as the time between Trayvon's death and Cheney's miraculous new heart going in his chest.

       "But solid organs have more complex shapes, so some teams start with existing organs, taken either from cadavers or from animals. They use detergents to strip away the cells, leaving behind a natural scaffold of connective tissues and blood vessels, which can then be seeded with a patient’s stem cells. It is the equivalent of stripping a building down to its frame and filling the walls back in. Scientists have made livers, lungs and even beating hearts in this way, and some have started to transplant their organs into animals."

       The new chronology detailed by a Russian mathematician named Fomenko. Read his book "History: fact or fiction".

       Too much to post but his mathematical proof is hard to dismiss.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love his extremely detailed analysis of the book of revelation describing a specific alignment of the stars from , get this, the 1400's A.D.!

       If this is true, then nothing you have ever learned is true.

       He points out there is more proof that the Holy Land was in Italy the whole time and that Palestine has only tradition and no archeology proof of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are pictures of Christian crosses and renaissance painting styles found in Herculaneum and Pompeii. Medieval descriptions of an inhabited Pompeii.

       Honestly that and wildheretic are the two most exciting but far out theories, IMO
