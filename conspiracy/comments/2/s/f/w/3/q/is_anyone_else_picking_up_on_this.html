       So I did some acid and things were weird, it was hard to communicate, I was trapped in my mind thinking. So I decided to go lay in bed and watch adventure time. I have Season 5 on my phone. The first couple episodes were fine, awesome as usual. But it started to get dark and lazy. Like they all stopped caring about the show and I picked up on what they were laying down. There are a lot of references to the characters killing themselves, being stuck making this show for the rest of their lives like someone is controlling them and forcing them to shove garbage down the consumers throats. That bummed me out so I went in the living room and everyone was watching whitest kids You know. It was the same way, they referred to the actors killing themselves and signing contracts and ruining their lives, but they still had to be funny about it. I put on Cloudy With a chance of meatballs 2 and that was the same. I put on Dumbo on Netflix (It was top recommended), that was retouched and not the same dumbo I remember. Dunno was released right around world war 2 (the holocaust) It was basically saying that the entertainment industry is just trying to get you to buy, buy buy, consume consume consume and that they don't give a shit about the content, they just need the people to laugh even if it's garbage. Much like a distraction. Then I saw a video on Facebook of these people in Europe pulling over on a highway then everyone on the highway came to a dead stop, got out of their cars and then a siren went off. For a solid 2 minutes this siren is going off and people are just standing there frozen. The siren stops and they get in their cars and drive off. It was a holocaust remembrance thing apparently. I watched another episode of adventure time and PB (who is German) gathers everyone into her kingdom and says that she made the gumball guards designed to spray every intruder with a noxious gas and to not be afraid, she was telling them to be prepared and how to overcome the gas by making their brain into a fist. I didn't watch the rest of the episode because I got so freaked out. Which brought me to the conclusion that there's going to be a holocaust soon.

       ah, yes.  also the diameter of peanut butter clusters protrude by the rotation of the wrist inspired by the 3rd cloud on Sunday after the back to back episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond signify the absolute use of the third atom in gummy worms are only to be dissolved by water carried from the Middle East in a small vile shaped like Elmer Fudd.

       I had some shrooms awhile back and watched a football game, on mute. It was all just evil. I enjoy watching it but the brutality caught me off guard (I was watching while I ate). The commercials are what really fucked with me, such evil schemes advertisements are. It was weird, way too weird. Hopefully you tested your stuff though so it wasn't some sketch shine.

       It is weird how psychelics make you see things in a different way, it distorts the reality you know and fills your mind with these New thoughts and paranoia, but when I mentioned this to people, they seem to have something more to contribute. Like one of my friends was telling me about the fema camps and the Georgia grave yards that are designed to hold up to five bodies each. Something isn't adding up and it's terrifying me.

       A little unsolicited advice, hallucinogens and conspiracy theories dont mix. I mean, i believe there is a conspiracy to keep psychedelics illegal for profit and to keep the populace from enlightenment and whatnot. But, to partake and theorize at the sametime probably isnt going to end up well. Its not what psychedelics are for. They are to teach you how to better yourself, by showing you perceptions that you otherwise wouldnt be open to.

       They just make you see through the 'veil' that is set up. It's up to the person to understand what they see though and talk themselves through the paranoia.

       Your post made me laugh but it also made me think. Yes, we take for granted the insane level of violence and negativity that most media is wrapped in nowadays. The constant need to stay up, ready and available 24/7 and swim or sink in this society makes it basically a necessity to stay in that constant state of anxiety, stress, and so we seldom have time or inclination to stop and really see, really hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a similar realization during the holidays; visiting family, I got to hang out a bit with young relatives (from 2 y.o. toddlers to 8 y.o. kids). On one side there was the first-hand encounter with open, receptive minds, a fresh change from the usual daily adult-world confrontation with people's mindsets set in stone. Also, the sad realization how influenceable and maleable kids' ideas and concepts can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other was a real look at the media most of these kids consume today. Everything from nursery rhyme videos to games (even 'educational' ones) to advertising geared towards them has such a frantic pace, nothing but quick cuts, fast action, overwhelming music and sound effects. I can't just imagine the effect this kind of sensory input will have on them, long term.

       Seriously though, i have always felt that when you do psychedelics, particularily LSD, you gotta immerse yourself in nature. Everything manmade is synthetic, heartless, and unnatural, and you will pick up on that negativity. It is possiboe that certain cues have pointed your attention to this conclusion, whether by design or on your own intuition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think it has less to do with picking up on pre-designs cues of premonition or forrshadowing, and more to do with the fact that your unconscious mind is kicking you conscious minds ass and showing it how negative the shit around you has become. This can be because of thr fucked up state of the world, or it could be more personal, and be dealing with your own demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, this is where i find the main difference between shrooms and lsd. Shrooms was always introspective. Lsd was sometimes one way, sometimes the other. Either way, its trying to teach you something.

       And its not that there is a holocaust soon... Thats not the lesson...

       Thanks, forgot about the TL;DR.
You're absolutely right, however I live in the city so there wasn't much nature to explore, but I've now come across something I would like to get more information about. I obviously don't have much evidence to back up my thoughts, but the first thing I felt when I watched Adventure Time was depression. I became very sad about the message they were sending because cartoons and animated movies was a field I was really interested in pursuing. Now that all of my favorite cartoonists and major motion picture animators are outwardly expressing how shitty their jobs are via their characters, I have very little aspirations for life. I also work for a phone company so that also made me despise my job. That I'm contributing to the brainwashing and spread of false information. In a few episodes of adventure time and WKUK, they said, and I paraphrase, "maybe you thought you could make a change in the world, bring some smiles to people's faces and that you're doing something you love, then you sign a contract and you face the rest of your life pushing out garbage, useless junk to make an audience chuckle so they'll keep consuming even though there's no actual content. Just let the joke die already." As an aspiring artist and seeing my role model outwardly express his hatred for the show definitely struck a nerve. This could be intentional, destroying the motivation people have to do these artistic and creative things. There are so many people affected by depression, there has to be influence from something other than their personal lives. I remember feeling depressed, anxious, like everything was about to come crashing down on me. I was half tempted to find someone to give me a xanax, but I know It wouldn't necessarily help. This made me think of all the people that go through this regularly. They need these drugs to feel normal. I just needed to be off drugs to feel normal. Is the media subliminally causing a depression? If just a few movies and shows made me feel that way (and I don't even watch Netflix that often) then how many people are being affected by this? Is the media trying to take away all aspirations and motivation these people have by destroying everything they ever believed in? The answer, in my opinion, is yes. They're getting closer and closer to stripping away everything we thought made us individuals and making us a whole so there is no identity anymore. What do they plan to do next? Maybe a holocaust. Maybe a 1984 dystopia. Who knows.
TL;DR: media is trying to make all of US depressed and rip away what makes us individuals.

       Absolutely. TPTB want everyone to be subdued, mellow, and conforming. Don't ask questions, don't buck the system. The carrot is perpetually dangled in front of us our entire lives, the majority choose to follow the carrot and ignore everything else.

       People are addicted to television. They believe whatever they see without question. They are zombies. It is sad, we are all capable of so much more.

       Interesting, I wouldn't be surprised based on how thinks are looking going into 2015 and the west wanting conflict with russia.

       Not to mention, it's well known that they put subliminal messages into shows that have a large number of viewers, so I could see it being possible.

       Yeah, what they said. Anyway, maybe I let my altered state of mind get to me, but maybe there's really something there. Like what everyone else is saying about psychedelics, but I've found this to be too big of a coincidence to just conclude with "I was just fucked up and none of this is real."

       While acid can and does allow you to see the truth about some things, it's not a magical doorway to the truth. It's still possible to draw conclusions on acid that are completely wrong. Acid makes you smarter in some ways, it allows a synergy between emotions and intellect that does seem to reveal hidden agendas, but one is still drawing conclusions from a limited perspective of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incomplete information leads to erroneous judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that on acid, you learn a lot of truths about yourself, and those truths can be used to better intuit the minds of others, but it's still possible to be totally wrong about the minds of others.

       ah, yes.  also the diameter of peanut butter clusters protrude by the rotation of the wrist inspired by the 3rd cloud on Sunday after the back to back episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond signify the absolute use of the third atom in gummy worms are only to be dissolved by water carried from the Middle East in a small vile shaped like Elmer Fudd.
