They are trying to get fracking companies, and other expensive energies (solar, wind etc) to go out of business, or at least slow them down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgive the outdated phrase, but I&#39;m seeing a &#39;tipping point&#39; of increasing attention by the press, citizen demands, recent bi-partisan actions in Congress and weakening obstacles all leading to an imminent release.  Of course this is my viewpoint, and there can be no &#39;certainty&#39;.  As to your other point, I follow that industrial war on energy producers.  Getting US oil production down through market manipulation is speculated to be a driver behind OPEC&#39;s drop of prices per barrel. Remembering an $800 check we got from W.Bush to &#39;stimulate the economy&#39; felt more like a payoff for his corrupted time in office.  I get the same feeling about OPEC and the Saudi&#39;s that control it, gifting billions back to Americans as a pre-emptive payoff for the brand and image they&#39;ll need once it&#39;s made public that they hit us in September.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Markets always fill needs.  Demand for new oil producers is low now.  That makes shale extraction unprofitable.  However, they aren&#39;t hurting competition as markets will always find equilibrium as long as they can last.  </p>

<p>I really feel like the whole oil play is to hurt Russia since the U.S. Seems to view him as a threat and they&#39;re very dependent on oil exports for their economy.</p>

This is a serious discussion, and I thank you for contributing, however the tone of your comment and your anger towards one culture and religion further make all of your claims feel unreliable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am against these fuckers that have subverted us since ww1 but honestly the answer to this is you don&#39;t land a helicopter on a burning building, especially a collapsing one. Even if you&#39;re able to take off a couple seconds prior to collapse (if you had notice) the sudden drop of the building causes the air to pull even hovering aircraft in with it, similar to that of when a ship sinks. </p>

<p>&quot;Within minutes of the first air strike on the World Trade Center, September 11, 2001, an NYPD Bell 412 helicopter with a 250 foot hoist and a three man crew trained for rooftop rescues, piloted by Detective Greg Semendinger arrived at the WTC.</p>

<p>In 1993 after a bomb exploded in the WTC basement garage, sending thick smoke up through the stairwells, Semendinger lowered two men to the roof of the same North Tower, who removed antennas to clear a landing area, from which 28 workers were airlifted to safety.&quot; </p>

<p>Semendinger remains culpable, for refusing to deploy the trained rooftop rescue team directly after the strike on the North Tower at 8:47 am .. the structure never collapsed until 10:28 am, he had plenty of time sod him! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pakistan&#39;s ISI funded the attacks, and  the  ISI was   probably funded by the CIA.  </p>

<p>The CIA had paid al Qaeda and the Taliban through the ISI since their founding by the George H.W. Bush lead CIA in the mid 1980&#39;s.</p>

<p>Mahmoud Ahmad of the ISI had his assistant write the funding check for Mohamed Atta the lead hijacker.</p>

<p>Ahmad Umar Sheikh, who worked for Ahmad  wrote the check for $100,000.</p>

<p>From all I could gather in these 13 plus years, the Saudi&#39;s had little to do with it other than donating the patsies.</p>

<p>Having had close contact with Mahmoud Ahmad at the critical point in time and not captured him but actually acting  as his  friend, Bob Graham and Porter Goss are people who could tell us who the plot was really hatched and carried out by.</p>

<p>They are certainly central characters in the attacks of 9/11 and they need to be confronted by the entire nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting thought, but i heard a more convincing explanation for the drop in oil prices.</p>

<p>It has more to do with (possibly intentional for malicious intent) the expansion of oil rigs and infrastructure to ptoduce much more oil than we (the world) need and can consume, causing the companies to eventually close shop and hurt the economy quite bad.</p>

<p>Im unfamiliar with the intricacies, as i cant recall all the details, but it was a fairly convincing explanation that ties into the economic manipulation of the worlds bankers that cause the 2008 recession and possibly the great depression back in the 30&#39;s. </p>

<p>Similar signs are showing up that indicate that this drop in oil prices are a bad, bad thing. But, it is nice to fill up my tank with $25... So we will see i guess.</p>

<p>Maybe both ideas (yours and this one above) are tied in together? Maybe phase two is being enacted? Phase One is 9/11 to get proper legislation drafted and enacted, Phase Two is economic destruction to justify enforcement of said legislation?</p>
