       World is fine, humans are fucked in the head. There are sane people for sure, but they keep quiet cause they're smart. Most of the insane ones would rather have us committed or locked up in a box somewhere so they don't have to deal with reality they helped create.

       People like our "Elite" make me sick. Not only do these people already have all the freedom in the world (heck, when you are rich enough you can get away with murder these days) but they want even more power. They already made it possible that slavery is legalized (again). They destroy the planet and thus they destroy the human race.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they don't know (at least most of them tend to forget) is that they are still human. And can just as easily be

       What I dont get is why when shit like this happens they go to the ones that bought them and grill them the way they do. With todays technology and all the shit we have we honestly cant find these traffickers and kill them while they sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly we as americans should be allowed to vote on wars and conflicts we get into as well. We know where cartel leaders live and can just launch a cruise missile from a ship off the coast and blow them the fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next guy gets the same. Pretty soon when you have killed enough they will learn its not a bussiness that really is worth dying for. We use same mentality for shit like this. I mean wtf is the point in fighting a war against an enemy you cant track like isis or what ever durka durka bullshit pops up next.
      </p>
      <p>
       We stop negotiating with them. If you get taken hostage sorry we will find you and them and nuke the site from orbit. Make these people that keep secrets and hide them pay too. You have to realize that fear and violence is what these people know. Being nice fucks it all up.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say whatever silly american with your Mickey mouse and Newport cigs. We are just gonna lie and keep these guys safe cause they are gonna hurt us or kill us if we talk. Yeah ok here is my response.  Destroy the block they are on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with these traffickers.  Sink the ship or blow the plane out of the sky. This planet has plenty of people to make up the difference my ways may seem harsh but I assurr you killing mother fuckers works.

       What an assholish and ignorant remark. I understand your frustration but you're no better than the war-mongering, power-junkies who fuel the shared frustration between both sides. The hippies had it right all along man. Blowing some other asshole up only pisses off his sons, pisses off his innocent neighbor when your ruin her petunias, pisses me off as I watch my tax dollars go up in a ball of flame, and pisses the nice hardworking road crew who has to fill that giant SOB pot hole we made. I'd hate the U.S. too if I was born under a broadening set of circumstances in the Middle East today, and observing the U.S's actions today certainly makes it difficult to not be disappointed. But as each new generation reinvents and redefines the high ideals espoused in our founding documents, butt-munches like you will continue to lead us down a wasteful and pointless path. Morning rant complete. Powering down.

       What is your solution?  Do we sit down have some tea and talk about the weather?

       Fact is money is what drives these people its that and fear of death. Its obvious we cant get their money cause many have tried they just move it around. So death.  It is a much easier solution when you think about it.

       Both economically and time wise. Its harsh yes and it sucks to even suggest it. That's what you gotta do be the asshole sometimes.

       These people have no value of anyone else's life why value theirs. And if their kids pick up the torch they suffer the same fate. Simple as that.

       If you have a logical conclusion to how it could end quicker by all means suggest it. I am more the willing to hear it.
