       Zionists are mostly right-wing Christians who believe in the End Times prophecy that says that the land of Israel will belong to the Jews before the return of Jesus and the end of the World.  Zionists collect money to help mostly Hasidic Jews settle the “occupied territories”, i.e., the land of Israel.

       I'd call it racism, if my opinion was asked. I would take the time to try to educate him, and do on this sub all the time. Not just him, but the community, for those that need to learn the diffrence between a small group inside a creed, and that creed itself. it can be difficult at times, and some never truely wish to learn, but I gottta do what I can ya know =)

       I'm the type of person who means what they say, and have a hard time understanding those who don't. Jews, not zionists, get mentioned a lot on here and I've always assumed that's what people meant. Why would they say that if you wrote it?

       Because they, themselves, might not understand the diffrence. There's alot of ppl around here that refers to jews, chirstians, heck, anyone that supports the nation of Israel, zionist. I think that's the correct defination of the term. IDK, this is a slippery rabbit slope. I can't speak for that guy, you're right. I presume the best in everyone until they show me I shouldn't, and even then...I hope. So idk, but not all jews are evil, not all christians, zionists, anyone..no group is pure evil, not even those a-hat nazis. Now the ones that were doing the killings in the camps, yeah, that's pretty fuckin evil, but the guy stationed in france that had no idea what was going on on the back side of the empire, I don't condone his actions, but I know it's not the same thing as flamethrower to despose of the bodies as quickly as we can, the allies are here, guy. Now around here that can't tell the differnce, and somemore that doesn't think there is one. But in all positions of power, the chance for corruption is there, and sometimes corrupt ppl will hijack a noble cause, like the early church for example, and turn it into something nasty, all the while most of thier members are like, "What loonacy! We don't do that!" and that;s true, they don't. But unfortnately they don't see that there are those thaat do do those things, and are using those that don't good works as a shield to hide behind while they swing thier sword, and kill ppl. All the while, they'r the ones that don't say what they mean, or mean what they say. They convience ppl of the lie so they can continue the destruction. And all creeds have this problem, and all creeds also have the solution. And that solution is love, not hate. So when I encounter hate, I try to give it understanding, because usually we only hate what we don't understand, once we understand it, that can help. Now that's not universal, but knowledge can be two sided sword.

       edit: I had alot of grammar mistakes, probably stil do. I'd also like to state for record I am a zoinist (heard ya gasp!), as in the Old Testiment, it clearly states, "May he who blesses Israel, be blessed. And he who curses Israel, to be cursed." I also don't wish they would find a way to be better off with thier ancestoral kin in the muslims. That neither side woudld believe death is the answer, but if we're all worshipping this same Abramhamic God (Jews, Muslims, Christains.) and the first commandment is to love thy God, and another is Love thy neighbor as yourself, and another says thou shalt not kill, then it seems to be all three of these guys are not truely following God, but thier own desires in His name. Now does that mean all jews, muslims &amp; christians are guilty of the sins of thier corrupted synagoges of satan? No, and God is smart enough to know who is real, and who is bullshit.

       I mean, we have to face the fact here folks. The media has a bias for protecting Jews. This would make perfectly reasonable sense because they have, essentially, captured control of that industry.

       <p>
        The Jews are so dominant, I had to scour the trades to come up with six Gentiles in high positions at entertainment companies. When I called them to talk about their incredible advancement, five of them refused to talk to me, apparently out of fear of insulting Jews. The sixth, AMC President Charlie Collier, turned out to be Jewish.

       Many understand that the Germans have led the way in automotive technology in many respects and have captured the leading edge of that industry. The same could be said for Jews who have pioneered the media industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that with the amount of exposure citizens get through the media, they can be influenced. So I guess the better question would be this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Would we allow this to happen?
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        The Muslims are so dominant, I had to scour the trades to come up with six non-muslims in high positions at entertainment companies. When I called them to talk about their incredible advancement, five of them refused to talk to me, apparently out of fear of insulting Muslims. The sixth, AMC President Charlie Collier, turned out to be Muslim.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If we lived in that world, people would go crazy.

       control is a strong word.  first, it implies a level of formal control vs. informal control
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, who controls US military according to the US Constitution?
The Commander-in-Chief, the president.  That is formally written into the law.
of course, that's not were power really rests.  The individual military commanders can act contrary to the president. see
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Truman%27s_relief_of_General_Douglas_MacArthur">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Truman%27s_relief_of_General_Douglas_MacArthur
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       is there a law that says the Jews control the media? no.  However, there are still formal structures we can look to.  For example, corporations are in many senses a government.  The CEO and Board can be analogous to the president and congress, though each corporation is different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at major media companies.  Don't just look at the CEO, look at the board.  For example, if every media company had a Jewish CEO and majority Jewish board then saying the Jews control the media would just be a fact.  This is not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question then is what percent is Jewish?  This is a complicated empirical question.  Ill try to answer this later.  However, it seems from anecdotal data that it is likely disproportionate to their population.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Jews have X percent influence.  This becomes a bean-pile problem.  For example, is one bean a "pile" of beans?  Two beans?  How beans does it take to make a "pile"?  How much influence does it take to make "control"?  Even if you did all the bean counting(or Jew counting), this would still come down to a value judgement as to what constituted a "pile".
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have 3 questions here:
1)Do the Jews control the media?
Doable.  Will take some work.
       <br/>
       2)Do the Jews control the economy?
There are about 6 million corporations in the US,
       <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/07/what-is-a-closely-held-corporation-anyway-and-how-many-are-there/">
        http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/07/what-is-a-closely-held-corporation-anyway-and-how-many-are-there/
       </a>
       This is uncountable, in my opinion.
       <br/>
       3)Do the Jews control the government?
Easy to count.  I can do that right now.
       <br/>
       President: Claims to be Christian, is accused of being Muslim.  Is most likely not religious.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether this constitutes control is a value judgement that no data can tell you.  And this analysis only looks at formal power.  Informal power is very important, if not more important.

       I'm in the process of doing a write-up on the Jews control the media question.  I have no idea what I will find.  It also occurs to me to look at other groups and their control, such as the Freemasons.
