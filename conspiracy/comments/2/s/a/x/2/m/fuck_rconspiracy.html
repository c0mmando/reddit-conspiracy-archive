       Its that simple. Now, extrapolate this to whatever has gotten you pissed off with an entire community. Why let someone elses words effect a negative reaction out of you?  If something offends you, downvote and move on. Or just simply ignore it.
      </p>

       Why shouldn't we care about this? Five seconds of fact checking indicates the redskins did not win the last 11 superbowls. Five seconds of fact checking indicates half the crap on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       presented as fact is
       <em>

        no
       </em>
       interest in truth here anymore, there is only blasting propoganda from the opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks to these latest waves of internet conspiracy theory, you cannot actually learn, for example, about what
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       problems are caused by Fukushima, because a typical google search will yield 90% disinformation from complete idiots who wouldn't know what a Becquerel was if it bit their ass.

       I think im with you about the truth, but where we differ (i suppose) is that i dont believe the official stories are 100% correct, just as i dont believe these theories are 100% correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am capable of sifting through bullshit by doing my own "5 second googling" to figure stuff out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, things might be sensationalized here. And, there are many folks here who have fallen hard for these theories, just like there are many who have fallen completely for whatever propaganda the governments issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is somewhere in the middle. Unfortunately, we have to sift through bullshit on both sides to figure out what is what.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all the evil in the world, we will never be told the complete truth. We will even be lied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       This causes resentment, and distrust, of the people towards their government.
      </p>
      <p>
       This distrust leads to these theories, which, unfortunately wont contain the whole truth because we dont
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       the whole truth. Some may even be lies as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not a black and white issue. Its a grey issue. And thats why i find value in some of these "bullshit" posts that spew obviously incorrect conclusions, or use obviously illogical reasoning for claims that are actually plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, this whole sub is not fucked. There are plenty of intellectual, well educated folks here, those who do their research, those who admit when they are wrong, and those who will seek further information about the counter arguments in their quest to remain unbiased.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad thing is, there are a bunch of dweebs in this sub that have more time on their hands to post a shit ton of crap which inevitable buries the good stuff. They also tend to be more interested in arguing more than debating. They seem more interested in trolling than reasoning with folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The squeeky wheel gets the oil" as they say. They are louder, and post more often, and get the most attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the others, we are still here.

       Anyhow, the modern geocentrism idea is that the sun revolves around the earth, yet the rest of the planets revolve around the sun (orbiting the ecliptic, which from earths point if view is tilted at 23.5 degrees - its the same as earths tilt, just from earths oerspective if it was standing straight up).

       The hard thing about this, is it is a valid viewpoint illustrating our solar system. But its get weird to me when you go further out and include the rest of the cosmos, as they see it like a "shell" of stars and earth is the exact center of this shell that rotates around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some key points that they believe is:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The earth does not move, nor rotate
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Everything else moves about the earth
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         earth is the exact center (barycenter) of the entire universe
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The theory of relativity is bullshit (im bitter about this one...)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the latest data from the cosmological microwave background noise projects (e.g. WMAP) proves that the tilt of axis of the earth (23.5°) coincides perfectly with the natural divisions apparently shown by the data, informally dubbed "The Axis of Evil."
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Theres a bit more to their claims than just "the sun revolves around the earth", some of which provides interesting paths of thought. But it doesnt convince me (i wanted to be clear on that).

       True. That leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth, and i tried extremely hard to bypass all of the theology induced arguments. I mean, there were literally dozens of explanations that argued, "because it says so in the bible, and the bible is the true word of god, and god is always right.." or something to that effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if you ignore all the religious mumbo jumbo, and respect some of the valid points (there were a few), its interesting. But not my cup of tea. It feels too....

       I love the Flat Earth Hypothesis. Obviously it doesn't stand up to much scrutiny, but it certainly makes some clever work-arounds for explanations.

       Haha, the concave earth. I remember that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked into it, and i cant remember the details, bit essentially the basis of their argument was a certain equation and calculation of the horizon, and the whole thing was based on incorrect use of math... Like orders of operation, or something... I cant remember.

       It was a fun read though.

       The hollow earth hypothesis was always interesting to me. Ive always thought there might at least be a huge cave/cavern system underground which could maintain complex life and ecosystems... But some versions of the theory are a little... Out there... (Though i enjoyed the movie Journey to thebCenter of the Earth)

       I actually vividly remember their mistake: They had one calculation for an elevation of hundreds of meters above the ground, and then when they tried to calculate higher up, instead of adding the extra small amount, they just used the added amount at their total height.

       Oh yea, i think i remember it also had something to do with the angle created from the observer, the horizon, and the heighth at which the observer stood. And their argument was thst there is no change in angle, which is false because the change was only just barely perceivable at those distances.
