       Even just a few days ago Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton were in the news for this, along with Prince Andrew and others. It seems like momentum was building with these stories, and now all of the sudden nothing. It seems like there is a complete media blackout. The massacre in France completely took over the news cycle. There needs to be a concerted effort to put these stories back in the forefront. The names of those involved in these horrendous acts need to be publicized as widely as possible.

       It's mysterious, all the coverage stopped at once, almost like a plug was pulled. The MSM can be easily manipulated by one big story, still doesn't explain the straight up disappearance from headlines.

       It's ironic that the only
       <strong>
        real conspiracy
       </strong>
       isn't the one being talked about on this sub anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ignorant masses are too busy speculating over the next "conspiracy" that really isn't a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hebdo wasn't a conspiracy, and the stupid photo op wasn't a conspiracy. Yet people HAVE to believe it is one to fit their ignorant world views.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only real conspiracy that means anything is the VIP sex scandal.

       covers hebdo pretty well, it's fairly conclusive it was a false flag, in particular the fact that blanks were fired out of the AK in the "kill shot" scene, it's jokingly obvious to anyone who has ever fired an AK and realizes the power of that round.

       comments like this: "Did a Rothchild defector blow the details of the Paris psy op? I'd say it is possible."

      <p>
       And this :"P.S. Regarding the Paris farce. I forgot to mention the amount such players get paid. It is 666,000 euros or dollars, depending on the country the event is staged in. The amount may seem random and insignificant to you, but once you know how important numerology and signs are to the Kabalistic Jews, things begin to make sense."

       No one is arguing that blanks don't cause recoil. The fact of the matter is IF THEY ARE USING BLANKS ITS A FALSE FLAG. It's obvious they are using blanks if you actually watch the video and have ANY CONCEPT of the power of 7.62 impacting a human head/concrete. You can see the dust puff from where the paper cartridge was ejected, had it been an actual killshot, or simply a missed shot, it would have looked far different. Any amateur that has fired an ak47 could tell you that.

       No speculation, the marks on the ground showing where to stop the car are obvious, but the "killshot" is the most glaring point.

       If you understand the power of an AK round, you realize that this was faked.

      <p>
       Two reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        If it actually hit the man, there would be blood at that range. Anyone saying otherwise is simply delusional, or intentionally lying.
       </li>
       <li>
        It's obviously a blank anyways, because of the dust puff that hits the ground about a foot away from the man's head. If a real round had impacted at that distance there would have been chunks of sidewalk blown up as well. All we see is a very slight puff from the paper from the blank round hitting the sidewalk.
       </li>

       Hate to burst your bubble, but I am a Graphic Artist and Video Analyst by profession and the trajectory at the exact moment of the shot in the video you linked to was consistent with a shot to the back of the head and neck area.
      </p>

       Exact moment of shot with mark ups

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The concrete "poof" is also consistent with the trajectory. Possibly a grazing wound to the back of the head where the neck starts.
      </p>
      <p>
       AK-47 blanks would not cause the concrete to powder and lift from the ground in a right path trajectory.

       This is just categorically wrong on so many levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it hits the head and goes that direction to the concrete, there would be loads of blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're wrong anyways, blanks would cause the concrete to have a dust puff, thats what they are, paper projectiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your image shows if ANYTHING that the bullet missed, NOT that it hit the head. However, if it did hit the head, particularly from that angle and range, there would be blood, no doubt about it.

       LOL paper projectiles? Do you even know how blanks work? The concrete is more than 5 feet away from him, blanks do not shoot out that far. You would have to be right up against the concrete like 3 inches away to even leave a mark.

       Yeah, no. Our country is being turned into a giant plantation. Our food supply is poison. Our children are learning propaganda and not much else. The elderly are being sucked dry and killed off by the medical industry. Anything of real value anymore is rapidly becoming out of reach. Our government no longer represents us to any degree and it terrorizes the globe in our name. Obama is about to shut down the internet as we know it. The black youth has been corrupted by the music industry for their spot in the prison industry. Our own government sold drugs on our streets while waging a war on drugs. We give Israel billions of dollars a year for no good reason. Our currency is only worth anything because we believe it is. They print more of this free currency and charge us interest on it.

       You can't take socio-economic issues and call them conspiracies, that's just stupid. A conspiracy is a plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful like murder.

      <p>
       You can't make everything into a conspiracy.

       As often as it takes for every man woman and child to become aware that many of our "leaders" and their minions are involved in pedophilia and child abuse. Are you suggesting that the MSM
       <em>
        hasn't
       </em>
       helped cover these stories up and downplay them over the past 20-30 years at minimum?
