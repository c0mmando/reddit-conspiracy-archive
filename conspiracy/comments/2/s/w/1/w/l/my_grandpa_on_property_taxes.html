If I choose not to pay them, the government will come and take it away from me. I don&#39;t want my money to go towards the worthless shit the government supposedly does with it. It supposedly goes to these worthless schools; where kids come out dumber than they were when they went in. My money is paying for these turds to not even be able to formulate a grammatically correct sentence. So not only am I not free to own my land, I&#39;m not free to decide where my money goes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m one of those grandparents. I have bi-racial grandsons. You can be assured I give a shit about their education!</p>

<p>Also, the care and needs of the other elder of this family isn&#39;t going to be drinking Brawndo any time soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. They are relatively okay now, but the way the medical establishment is yanking them around and how little control anyone anyone really has over the situation is scary. I think, also, they will never admit it, but they&#39;re scared. I am, too. Their doctors have so much control and so little control at the same time -- so little time/care/investment in positive outcomes. I live far away, but was able to go to an appointment with them while I was there and was just totally taken aback by the coldness and callousness. &quot;Take this test, which is pretty much torture and really isn&#39;t needed, but Medicare will pay for it.&quot; The only time one of the doctors appeared to be &quot;there&quot; was when he snapped at my Grandma about an offhand political statement she made (which she was correct about anyway - she was having trouble getting her medications renewed because of Obamacare changes - medication that, if discontinued, can cause dangerous side effects). Then he faded away again...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. The cognitive dissonance is so strong, too. &quot;I know that this medication is what caused my loved one to commit suicide. But I need it.&quot; Terrifying to me. All I can really do now is stress how important it is that they never run out of that drug. And terrified that at some point the insurance or doctor will decide they need to cold-turkey quit...and what do we do then? The lack of control really scares me. How quickly the system has gotten complete and total power over individuals is terrifying.</p>
