       Exactly.  While I might not go as far as to call it "cancer", I will indeed definitely say that it's little more than distraction from what's really going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm about one of the most serious people I know.  I'm pretty consistently either getting called out or upsetting people for being "too serious".  That never keeps me from continuing to take seriously the many things that I do nonetheless, but I will also say that occasional moments of brief levity aren't
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       worst thing in the world.  For this reason, I wouldn't begrudge that subreddit's facetiousness all too much.

       I'll go ahead and make this a little easier for you. You said they are racist and ignorant subs. I'll define those words for you, to make sure you understand them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racist - Believing that one race is superior to another
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignorant - Lacking information
      </p>
      <p>
       So could you explain to me how
       <a href="/r/niggers">
        /r/niggers
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/whiterights">
        /r/whiterights
       </a>
       believe they are a superior race, and explain what information they are lacking? Specifically. Thank you!

       If you're not aware of what the history and connotation of the word "nigger" is on this planet, and aren't aware of the extent to which calling someone that (let alone creating a sub titled that) is racist and ignorant, then I really,
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       can't help you...or, more accurately, don't think it worth the time to try to explain it to you.

       So, now that I have even gone so far as define all the words, simply, for you. . . . you still can't answer my question.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know who created the sub,
       <a href="/r/niggers">
        /r/niggers
       </a>
       ? Do you know what race they are?
      </p>
      <p>
       What does the history of the word "nigger" have to do with one race believing they are superior to another? Which races are we even talking about, all we know is the name of a sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what information are they lacking exactly? What is it that these subs believe that is so errant? What information do you have for them?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is it about
       <a href="/r/WhiteRights">
        /r/WhiteRights
       </a>
       that is racist and ignorant? Is it ignorant to believe that whites have rights? Is it racist to believe whites have rights? If so, could you explain how?

       This post isn't about white rights, this post is about disparaging a whole race of people based upon the worst examples of that race of people.  You can do this to any race.  White people have some ridiculous groups just like black people do.  We have the KKK, the white national socialists, the rainbow tribe etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the subreddit
       <a href="/r/whiterights">
        /r/whiterights
       </a>
       was on topic and specifically about white rights then it honestly wouldn't be that bad of a sub.  But in reality it's "white people have rights took because look at how bad these black people act!"... two subjects that aren't related.

       So you cherry picked one post, and made that representative of the entire sub. Would you like me to do that with

       Maybe I have a warped view of national socialist based upon my experience with them.  I'm willing to admit as much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for the KKK, never met one that I liked or that I was able to tolerate their proximity.  Rainbow tribe, bunch of criminals who pretend to be hippies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is definitely a cross section of society that I prefer to deal with, a cross section that I find tolerable and a multitude of sections that I have no desire to acknowledge their existence.  I think most people probably feel the same way internally, I'm not going to hang out with rainbow tribe people just to force diversity on myself, or national socialists or thugs or bible bangers.  I'm just not interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       I prefer what I prefer.  When people start talking in terms like "sand niggers" and "coon people" I tend to lose interest fairly quick.  When people start talking about "cis privileges" and "neck beards" I equally lose interest.

       Never said i was confused. It's simple A carnal mind cannot comprehend the spiritual.... It's impossible for me to let the truth go. Once you have it, it goes no where. Again as I said before, Faith is not blind according too scripture. Faith is Thee EVIDENCE of things not yet seen and the substance of things hoped for. So if I have Evidence how is faith blind?

       Lots of reasons. How about, to start. . . there's billions of potentially inhabitable planets in this universe. One only needs to be a million years older than us to be a million years more advanced than us. Look how far we have come in just 7000 years. From barely writing to landing on Mars. Imagine if we had another million to evolve? We'll be visiting other planets too. So why wouldn't anyone come visit us by now?

       I guess you forgot Newton's first law. Don't worry, I'll remind you, friend! Objects in motion, tend to stay in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. But in the vacuum of space, there are no outside forces. So once you achieve the velocity you want, it actually takes no more energy to maintain that speed, no matter what distance you go!

       You're absolutely right. There would be no need to travel anywhere just for that. Well, not outside of your own county anyway. But maybe they came for more reasons that what you currently understand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they needed raw materials that they depleted on their planet. Maybe a part of restoring their atmosphere requires certain minerals found here on Earth? It's certainly a resource full planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they simply destroyed their planet and were out in space looking for a new planet to live on. You ever see Interstellar? You should, M.M. is quite the hunk!

       The Star Child Skull would be one piece of evidence saying that life on other planets is pretty intelligent, seeing as how that skull was proven to be most certainly not from this planet (according to the DNA), and the size of the brain was larger than most current humans, and it was on a 5 ft frame.

       The point is that they could just harvest other asteroids or lifeless planets. Life friendly planets can't possibly be that common, yet you suggest that they would bother Earth of all places for resources. Why would aliens waste their effort to main secrecy while stripping our resources instead of just moving to the next rock that has what they need?

       Beings from Venus? I have never heard that life developed naturally on Venus. So if there are people living there, such as humans or reptilians, then I would generally label them based on where they came from, perhaps Pleiadians and Draconians, respectively.
      </p>

       I've only found little info on them and a while back at that. From what I read they destroyed the planet with their technology on accident. In the 60s there was a group of Venusians that contacted the government. I always wanted more information on it. Apparently some people could contact them through meditation. Not a lot to go off of.

       Channeling is very common, yes. Many evolved species communicate through telepathy. We are all just parts divided of a greater whole. The energy that makes up that whole also allows us to communicate with one another. We are all connected. That energy is what makes up our consciousness, our emotions, everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are describing sounds more like Mars. If you google "Life on Mars eradicated by nuclear weapons", you'll get some info about a physicist who recently put all the evidence together.
      </p>
      <p>
       There could very well have been life on Venus millions of years ago though. I do not profess to know everything about every alien race ever. It just seems like if we had other races so close, they would be more involved with various things.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you happen to come across any more info on them, please let me know.

       Channeling was the word I was looking for and couldn't find. Speaking of channeling I'm going to assume you have read about the channeling of the entity that calls itself Ra. If you haven't it seems like something you would be interested in.

       The alien question is fascinating because you can come at it from so many different angles, and still end up with nothing.  Almost anything you see or experience can be explained by advanced technology or psychological phenomena.  There is plenty of weirdness in religious and political history.  But, given the central role of manipulation in human civilization, that's not likely to be reliable evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing that always gives me pause, though, is the Fermi paradox.  It's just not likely that space is empty or that vast distances are impossible to overcome.

       I think the most compelling evidence is The Star Child Skull. A skull that looks much like you'd expect from an small alien grey, with DNA that cannot be explained. There is also a ton if misinfo and disinfo spread about it. Lloyd Pye mysteriously died of hyper-aggressive (weaponized) cancer right before making a full disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Billy Meier with his discovery of the Talmud of Jmmanuel, and his predictions concerning celestial bodies that we didn't have the technology to detect until years later. The Thulium. etc etc. Billy Meier has a lot of compelling evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, you can be sure that there is some truth to it based on how much disinfo is spread about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's things like Phil Schneider and the Deep Underground Military Bases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Graham Hancock and John Anthony West have also done a lot of research on ancient civilizations and their relationship with E.T.s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like the pyramids that are perfectly lined up with constellations on the equinox in 10,500 BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can take any one piece of evidence and try to dismiss it, but there is no way to dismiss all the evidence, especially when it is all pointing to the same thing.

       I read some of the Billy Meier / Talmud of Jmmanuel stuff, and it seems just speculation and invention.  I don't see any solid evidence there that has withstood real, independent examination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should it have been impossible for ancient Egyptians to line up pyramids with the stars ?  They were a very successful civilization for thousands of years, had great organization and good technology in military, irrigation, construction, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as "there is no way to dismiss all the evidence", this is just an attempt to reverse the burden of proof.  You are making an extraordinary claim, the burden is on you to provide extraordinary evidence.  Instead, you are throwing a bunch of half-baked stuff at us, and saying we have to disprove it.

       They dont necessariky have to be from OFF this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just as conceivable and plausibke for "extraterrestrials" to actuslly be from another branch of hominds thst eveolved seperately from homo sapiens.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, there are the chimpanzees and the bonobo. Almkst exactly alike, except for their psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chimps evolved through a world of competition, which means natural selection chose the most powerful and agressive specimens to carry on to their progeny. This means that selfishness and greed and success through anothers downfall. Sounds fairly human-like, dont it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the bonobos. They succeeded through mutual beneficisl actions. They helped eachother. They survived and evolved by being empathetic, sympathetic, selfless, and helpful. Sounds like the gods of religions and their angels, dont it? (An argument could be made thst this also sounds human-like. But this woukd almost imply thst humans somehow are a crossbreed of bonobo and chimps, but evolved with some different genetics sometime down the road....)
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, they dont have to originate from anywhere else but earth to maintain logical sense. In fact, i tend to believe "aliens" are just at home on earth as we are...
      </p>
      <p>
       But i am still completely open to extraterrestrials, mind you...

       Yes, of course. It is my understanding that humans came from Lyra, then spread to the Pleiades after landing on Earth. I also believe that dinosaurs continued to evolve for millions of years and now live underground or inside the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, some "aliens" are not extraterrestrial at all, and some "humans" are very much extraterrestrial.
