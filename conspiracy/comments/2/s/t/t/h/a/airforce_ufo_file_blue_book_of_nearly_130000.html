       In any event, I feel reasonably certain hat some stimulus existed in France– whether political, scientific, extraterrestrial, meteorological, or psychological– that in the space of two months generated several hundreds of reports, reports which show a definite thread of pattern.  So, with this preamble, let us travel to France, in the late summer, 1954.
      </p>
      <p>
       The curtain apparently went up on this fantastic show on August 23, at 1:00 a.m., 40 miles northwest of Paris.  A businessman had just put his car away, and as he cam rout of the garage he was surprised to see a pale light illuminating the town which had been in complete darkness a little while before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the sky, he was a huge, silent, motionless luminous mass, apparently suspended above the north bank of the river some 300 yards away.  "It looked," he said, "like a gigantic cigar standing on end standing on end.  I had been watching this amazing spectacle for a couple of minutes when suddenly from the bottom of the cigar came an object like a horizontal disk, which dropped at first in free fall, then slowed, and suddenly swayed and dived horizontally across the river toward me, becoming very luminous.  A few minutes after it had disappeared behind him, going southwest at prodigious speed, a similar object came front he cigar and went through the same maneuvers.  A third object, and then a forth– and finally a fifth, detached itself from the cigar which was still motionless...
      </p>
      <p>
       Three weeks later, September 14, there was a repetition–– in broad daylight, and observed by hundreds of witnesses in a half dozen villages in the general area 250 miles S.W. of Paris… "It was about five in the afternoon.  Emerging from the thick layer of clouds that looked like a storm coming up, we saw a sort of luminous blue violet mist, of a regular shape something like a cigar or carrot.  Actually the object came out of the layer of clouds in an almost horizontal position, slightly tilted toward the ground and pointing forward, like a submerging submarine.
      </p>
      <p>
       "This luminous cloud appeared rigid.  Whenever it moved, its movements had no connection with the movement of the clouds, and it moved all of a piece, as if it were actually some gigantic machine surrounded by mists.  It came down rather fast from the ceiling of clouds to an altitude which we though was perhaps half a mile above us.  Then it stopped, and the point rose quickly until the object in a vertical position, where it became motionless.
      </p>
      <p>
       "All at once white smoke exactly like a vapor trail came from the lower end of the cloud… only then, after the smoke trail had vanished entirely, could we see the object that was sowing it– a little metallic disk, reflecting in its rapid movements flashes of light from the huge vertical object.  The little disk then stopped turning around the luminous cloud and went down toward the ground again, this time moving away.  For quite a few minutes we could see it flying low over the valley, darting here and there at great speed, sometimes speeding up, then stopping for a few seconds, then going on again, flying in every direction between villages that were four miles apart… the carrot (the original cigar-shaped mother craft) leaned over and began to move, accelerated and disappeared into the clouds into the distance.  The whole thing lasted about half an hour."
      </p>
      <p>
       It would take us too long to quote from the other witnesses– about a hundred in all– but their stories were about the same.
