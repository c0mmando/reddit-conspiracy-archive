    <div class="md"><p>Even if there is a greater mystery or whatever regarding the origin of species, it can&#39;t really be denied that evolution is real. I mean, you can observe it yourself with a petri dish and some antibiotic agar.</p>

<p>Even if there is a god, deity, or whatever other super-advanced being pulling some strings that we&#39;re unaware of, it doesn&#39;t invalidate the observation that lifeforms adapt to their surroundings.</p>

<p>What do you think when you see a big pair of tits? God made them? No, <em>we</em> made them by liking them. Maybe god made us like them. Fair enough, but the mechanism by which they are produced is still congruent with the theory of evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, my personal hypothesis involves an almost infinite multiverse where all creatures, once reaching a point where sexual selection plays a role, leads to arbitrary evolutionary paths that seek differentiation and increased awareness.</p>

<p>The will of &quot;God&quot; in terms of whatever it is that furnishes us with our self awareness, is to only &quot;see&quot; the forms that manifest the expression of its (God&#39;s) will. This current reality appears to be the unlikely path taken by evolution on Earth because it is here that God&#39;s &quot;attention&quot; is focused.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s a mixture of evolutionary forces guided by the mathematical and statistical rules of reality meeting the will of the &quot;creator&quot; to observe this particular manifestation of that process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition to the wonderful responses of InternetPropagandist; I would like to add mine, here. </p>

<p>Evolution does not have to be &quot;proven&quot; separately in the human case. Either it is or it isn&#39;t. Since you demand change that can be seen over generations, there are more than sufficient evidences from experiments in bacterial lines to demonstrate the mechanics of evolution: mutation, adaptation, population change.</p>

<p>As for human experimentation, &quot;we&quot; do not need to do anything of the sort, if you demand it. Nature has already done that dirty work for us:
- the human lineage was struck by the drying of Africa and retreat of the great intercontinental forest millions of years ago. Our ancestors responded by leaving the trees and taking to the savannah; apes recede from most of asia and europe. Recent analysis of the ardipithecus skeleton shows that our ancestors walked upright much earlier than had been believed.
- the human lineage is struck by an ice age and a population diverges from a common ancestor that specialises in colder climate and close quarter hunting of megafauna. Dna evidence shows that we crossbred with this ancestor, but they still went extinct.
- The human lineage is struck by a supervolcano 70 000 years ago. Mitochondrial DNA evidence suggests that humans were reduced to a population of a few thousand; the oldest strains traced to the hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari.
- The human lineage is struck by an asteroid strike that kills our neighbours, the dinosaurs, about 65 million years ago. Size, metabolism, fur-bearing and burrow-dwelling are some of the facts that allow us to survive. No photographs, but we have a good description of gramps.
-etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re theory is your subject, so yes. This sub Reddit is about conspiracy theories after all. Look, you&#39;re the one distracted here, and you need to question more important things like &quot;Is there an economic Reich attempting to subtly enslave humanity, and have they done so already?&quot;. Study science on the side dude; it&#39;ll help you figure technicalities out. Saying evolution is a fraud is on or near the same level of stupidity as flat-earthers. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I had a grammar error; I probably have many. 2 is correct. As for 3, I suggested studying the theory and testing it for yourself. It&#39;s observable for fucks sake. Somehow that&#39;s tainting something or not allowing someone to derive their own conclusions (lol?). It&#39;s safe to say you are stupid, and that is closer to a fact than an insult. Evolution is not a certainty (after all, absolutism is foolish), but it&#39;s damn likely, and it&#39;s currently not being disproven. On flat-eathers: I was referring to those who still believe in it, regardless of debunking (which is similar to those that deny evolution without any understanding of the knowledge of it). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition to the wonderful responses of InternetPropagandist; I would like to add mine, here. </p>

<p>Evolution does not have to be &quot;proven&quot; separately in the human case. Either it is or it isn&#39;t. Since you demand change that can be seen over generations, there are more than sufficient evidences from experiments in bacterial lines to demonstrate the mechanics of evolution: mutation, adaptation, population change.</p>

<p>As for human experimentation, &quot;we&quot; do not need to do anything of the sort, if you demand it. Nature has already done that dirty work for us:
- the human lineage was struck by the drying of Africa and retreat of the great intercontinental forest millions of years ago. Our ancestors responded by leaving the trees and taking to the savannah; apes recede from most of asia and europe. Recent analysis of the ardipithecus skeleton shows that our ancestors walked upright much earlier than had been believed.
- the human lineage is struck by an ice age and a population diverges from a common ancestor that specialises in colder climate and close quarter hunting of megafauna. Dna evidence shows that we crossbred with this ancestor, but they still went extinct.
- The human lineage is struck by a supervolcano 70 000 years ago. Mitochondrial DNA evidence suggests that humans were reduced to a population of a few thousand; the oldest strains traced to the hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari.
- The human lineage is struck by an asteroid strike that kills our neighbours, the dinosaurs, about 65 million years ago. Size, metabolism, fur-bearing and burrow-dwelling are some of the facts that allow us to survive. No photographs, but we have a good description of gramps.
