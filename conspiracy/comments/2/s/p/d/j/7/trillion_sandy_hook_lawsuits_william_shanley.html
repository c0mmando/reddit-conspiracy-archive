<p><a href="http://www.jud2.ct.gov/crdockets/CaseDetail.aspx?source=Pending&amp;Key=865fff9d-2e6a-4f19-84d0-cefd877f7800">http://www.jud2.ct.gov/crdockets/CaseDetail.aspx?source=Pending&amp;Key=865fff9d-2e6a-4f19-84d0-cefd877f7800</a></p>

<p>According to the pending case detail (linked above) William Shanley is still incarcerated as of 1/16/2015.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On December 22, 2014 author and filmmaker William Shanley filed a trillion dollar lawsuit against several dozen of the world’s most powerful corporate media outlets and figures for what he terms “a multi-year conspiracy,” to “brainwash the public into thinking a lone gunman drill known as the Sandy Hook Massacre was real, when in fact, it was a staged FEMA National Level Exercise Event that redirected government resources to terrorize the public.”</p>

<p>EDIT: If you are looking for the amount in the linked document then it will probably help to know that it is presented as two claims for punitive damages of $500 billion dollar each. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is interesting that the other &quot;top&quot; Sandy Hook indie investigators are now trying to discredit Shanley and distance themselves from him over Shanley&#39;s rant at Prof. Doom. If you read some of the comments <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JbuFWpVB7E">here</a> it seems like there is a deep divide. Prof. Doom has made at least two videos where the sole purpose seems to be exposing Shanley as a lunatic that can&#39;t be trusted with the conspiracy jewels. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve known sane people that have social issues and I have witnessed the duality that can exist in a &quot;extreme&quot; type person. IMO, Shanley&#39;s rant is not such a huge offense that he should be completely shunned. Of course saying that might make me look like a shill. Everyone&#39;s a shill. Paranoia will destroy ya.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shanley looks drugged in the police mug shot. The CW Wade web site that posted this, is part of the Sandy Hook Truther debunking dirty tricks goon squad. 
<a href="http://sandyhookanalysis.blogspot.cz/2015/01/william-shanley-jailed-for-felony.html">http://sandyhookanalysis.blogspot.cz/2015/01/william-shanley-jailed-for-felony.html</a></p>

<p>So there are three possibilities: 
1, Shanley is having some kind of mental breakdown. 
2. Shanley is a cut out or paid useful idiot used to demonize Sandy Hook Truthers. 
3. The organized crime syndicate behind Sandy Hook, snatched him, drugged him, disheveled his hair and took about the strangest, ugliest mug shot imaginable. Reminds me alot of the photo-shopped crazed photo used of Jared Lee Loughner in the Tucson Shooting.
<a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=15083">http://winteractionables.com/?p=15083</a></p>

<p>The fact that Shanley is still in jail 18 days later is highly suspect, making me lean towards #2 or #3. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all know that one of the most effective ways to get rid of a well known (or too public to make disappear) trouble maker is put their sanity into question. It&#39;s hard not to read into all the comments that conclude that Shanley has gone insane. Lots of bandwagon jumping. Of course it could be that the guy has legitimately caused so many problems that this was the catalyst needed to oust him from the group. It will be interesting to see how this unfolds. </p>

<p>EDIT: It bothered me that I reused the phrase &quot;history shows us&quot;, replaced with &quot;we all know&quot; even though I don&#39;t know if we all know. I&#39;m weird that way I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Resisting arrest. Assault on officer. And breach of peace. Assault was the felony and the others were misdemeanors. I found a YouTube video that explained a tiny bit more. I&#39;m curious how he got involved with police.</p>
