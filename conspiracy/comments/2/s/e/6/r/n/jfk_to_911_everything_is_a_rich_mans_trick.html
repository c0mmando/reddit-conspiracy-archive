    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP how did you find out about this movie and do you know anything about the author at all? I&#39;m almost done with the movie and it is definitely an interesting/intriguing watch to say the least. I&#39;m totally with this movie on a lot of things but I&#39;m finding it confusing that nowhere on the internet can I find information on the guy who made it, Francis Richard Conolly. He credits his father at the beginning of the movie (Emmanuelle John Conolly) and no cross search between the two names yields anything either. I&#39;m not trying to pose a conspiracy on top of a conspiracy at all, but was interested to see if you knew anything about him or if any other person reading this has had more luck in searching out the subject. Thanks again for posting the movie, I really enjoyed it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, I was chatting on FB about EO11110 and I was shit sure that was one of the main reasons that JFK was killed. A mutual FB friend turned me on to Ed Griiffin&#39;s page that debunked that specific thing about JFK and that executive order. I really respect his work(The Creature from Jekyl Island) so I backed off it.  Obviously Jack Ruby was a Jew but to say Mossad did it? I don&#39;t think so. The CIA was totally capable of it and they all wanted him dead.  Here is proof we were going to go out of Vietnam  <a href="http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/w6LJoSnW4UehkaH9Ip5IAA.aspx">http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/w6LJoSnW4UehkaH9Ip5IAA.aspx</a></p>

If you have doubts ,when  you finish this, listen to Kay Griggs experience with her husband.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQNitCNycKQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQNitCNycKQ</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about Hoover really, I understand the climate of the time. </p>

<p>I have two different beefs here, firstly the pretty homophobic &#39;pink triangle&#39; logo with the stripper marine <a href="http://imgur.com/wFKy8FR">http://imgur.com/wFKy8FR</a>, which is not only offensive but historically also inaccurate, the Nazis used the symbol of a solid upside down pink triangle in concentration camps sewn on to gay people, and after the war it became a symbol of defiance.</p>

<p>Secondly, I&#39;m not necessarily saying that I don&#39;t believe Kay Griggs&#39; story, there could definitely have been systematic abuse going on, but to just say that that will turn you into a gay psychopath, then say &#39;look, LHO was gay, Jack Ruby was gay, David Ferrie was gay. They must have been &quot;homosexually recruited&quot; is awful, it has nothing to do with opinions of the time, it is his opinion when he made this doc that the reason they capitulated in whatever way they did was because they were broken and turned into &#39;gay psychopaths&#39; by military intelligence.</p>

<p>I think what really got to me was that throughout the documentary he has been suggesting that these evil people are evil and to top it off they are gay too, adding it to the list of their sins.</p>

<p>Overall though I really liked this film, I really would love to have a chat with the guy that made it. I thought I was pretty well read on JFK but I&#39;ve not heard of the storm drain shot before, I&#39;d want to see where he got all this new info from, or how he came to his conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well obviously in our time it&#39;s waay more accepted and kids for the most part are really ok and usually they are done bullying with it unless you come across a bunch of dumbfucks and they are everywhere so, with that said the author was making the point that they had to stay closeted at the time because it was completely unacceptable. Especially for guys who are supposed to be mean ass fighting marines. They would out you for society to ridicule you and that was a means of control. As I watch it that is what I grasp about it. You are going to do.........whatever we say or this video footage of you sucking dick goes to your ..........</p>
