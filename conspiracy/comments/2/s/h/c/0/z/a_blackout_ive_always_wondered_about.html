       I was in San Diego when this happened. People were out on their lawns, visibly frightened, I saw spot lights being shot into the air. I heard ambulances and police sirens everywhere. It felt like something that would happen before a large assault on the West Coast from the Pacific.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On the afternoon of September 8, 2011, an 11-minute system disturbanc eoccurred in the Pacific Southwest, leading to cascading outages and leaving approximately 2.7 million customers without power. The outages affected parts of Arizona, Southern California, and Baja California, Mexico. All of the San Diego area lost power, with nearly one-and-a-half million customers losing power, some for up to 12 hours. The disturbance occurred near rush hour, on a business day, snarling traffic for
hours. Schools and businesses closed, some flights and public transportation were disrupted, water and sewage pumping stations lost power, and beaches were closed due to sewage spills. Millions went without air conditioning on a hot day. Homeland Security warned of a possible terror strike in the days leading up to the tenth anniversary of 9/11.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This was the governments answer for why it happened:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The loss of a single 500 kilovolt (kV)2 transmission line initiated the event, but
was not the sole cause of the widespread outages. The system is designed, and should be
operated, to withstand the loss of a single line, even one as large as 500 kV. The affected
line—Arizona Public Service’s (APS) Hassayampa-N. Gila 500 kV line (H-NG)—is a
segment of the Southwest Power Link (SWPL), a major transmission corridor that
transports power in an east-west direction, from generators in Arizona, through the
service territory of Imperial Irrigation District (IID), into the San Diego area. It had
tripped on multiple occasions, as recently as July 7, 2011, without causing cascading
outages.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the SWPL’s major east-west corridor broken by the loss of H-NG, power
flows instantaneously redistributed throughout the system, increasing flows through
lower voltage systems to the north of the SWPL, as power continued to flow into San
Diego on a hot day during hours of peak demand. Combined with lower than peak generation levels in San Diego and Mexico,3 this instantaneous redistribution of power
flows created sizeable voltage deviations and equipment overloads to the north of the
SWPL. Significant overloading occurred on three of IID’s 230/92 kV transformers
located at the Coachella Valley (CV) and Ramon substations, as well as on Western
Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) Path 44,4 located south of the San Onofre
Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) in Southern California.
       </p>
       <p>
        The flow redistributions, voltage deviations, and resulting overloads had a ripple
effect, as transformers, transmission lines, and generating units tripped offline, initiating
automatic load shedding throughout the region in a relatively short time span. Just
seconds before the blackout, Path 44 carried all flows into the San Diego area as well as
parts of Arizona and Mexico. Eventually, the excessive loading on Path 44 initiated an
intertie separation scheme at SONGS, designed to separate SDG&amp;E from SCE. The
SONGS separation scheme separated SDG&amp;E from Path 44, led to the loss of the SONGS
nuclear units, and eventually resulted in the complete blackout of San Diego and
Comisión Federal de Electricidad’s (CFE) Baja California Control Area. During the 11
minutes of the event, the WECC Reliability Coordinator (WECC RC) issued no directives
and only limited mitigating actions were taken by the Transmission Operators (TOPs) of
the affected areas.

       I took ~3-4 months to get that answer and I don't believe it. I brought this to r/conspiracy because I want to get more light on it. I think on that day we were attacked by a foreign nation prodding into our electrical infrastructure, and it was successful. This would be an act of war, so I'm cautious, but it just seems like too large of an issue, with too little of a concrete explanation. Note that their explanation explains what happened after the line tripped, it does not explain why the line tripped.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI investigated the incident for terrorism, I think they knew it was, but couldn't prove it, I think they didn't want to admit to the American people that not only was our infrastructure vulnerable, but they don't even know where it came from. I think perhaps the attackers didn't know it would do that much damage.

       I remember this, my buddy works for the electrical company in SD, I asked how one guy could shut down the power to all of so cal. He said there's no way, that story is BS. I believe it was a hack to see how the gov would react, so cal is so dependent on power, and especially water that if tees systems were taken down it would be chaos.

       It was chaos. Imagine every single stop light going out. I'm sure you've seen traffic happen because some stop light goes to blinking red. Imagine tens of thousands of them. The traffic was unheard of, we're talking like freeways backed up, and all minor streets backed up.

       I was working and living in hillcrest/north park area. This was one of the best things I've ever experienced. It was amazing to see people drop every bit of responsibility in those hours. No power and no working cell towers. People resorted to actually socializing with one another.

       Its weird the FBI investigated. That makes me think they know something we don't. Even if they were wrong and it was just a fluke, I would really want to know
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       they felt the need to investigate.

       It's also possible that these grids function as distributed systems and calculating all variables 40-50 years in advance isn't really possible. Couldn't it be that we are just broke and have bad infrastructure so we can't audit or change what we have? Isn't that theory just as likely at this point?

       People seem not to realize how much money has been siphoned away, where from, and by whom.  The rich cabal that controls the world is profoundly stupid and myopic.  The infrastructure of America is crumbling due to an insanely greedy lack of reinvestment in society.  Our sewers, roads, electricity, water, basic government bureaucracies are all dramatically reduced in integrity and capacity from where they should be.

       Of course, but why did the FBI get involved? Difficult to understand what really happened, because it seems like their own engineers really weren't sure. That's some
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       complicated engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the FBI got involved says something. What would make them investigate a power outage? There must have been some detail that got them involved. Also, shortly after this incident, there was a lot of talk from the government about hackers being able to mess with our infrastructure. They've stated before that the Chinese have probably in fact been messing with stuff, as we are probably messing with their stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its true that our infrastructure is pretty bad, but this also means its vulnerable.

       Maybe the fbi got involved because everything looks like terrorism to them now...and it has to justify its new counterterrorism mission by investigating anything remotely out of the ordinary.

       Naw that makes perfect sense. I could see some engineers being like, dude it was just a malfunction....hrmm malfunction you say? The FBI will the authority on that, and they have no idea how any of it even works.

       IMO, it was the government who either let or initiated this event to test the result and evaluate the costs/ benefits. If an attack on the U.S. were to happen like this that was unexpected, now they have an accurate and average reaction from the general public, which is who they need to control in such a situation. There are the physical ops, the PsyOps come later.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, they tested 9/11-type events before they pulled the trigger on that operation; why not test something like this to see if it is effective as an attack the public will believe and let themselves be scared enough from to justify more relinquishing of privacy and other freedoms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it REALLY outside the realm of possibility?

       For me, the fact that there was no serious investigation into what happened, or apparent repercussions, makes it quite likely that it was a deliberate act involving government agencies - a drill, in other words.

       Ive never heard of this! Its very plausible they never figured it out. I do know there was/is a mexican gang called the knights templar who have been known to knock out power lines in mexico, causing outages and stuff...

       I think I remember hearing about this. Wasn't it involving a substation that was "shot" at? There were casings found but no prints, no weapons, but there were tracks all around the perimeter?

       This was either a government test or a fake "act of terror." I know the grid pretty well and this simply couldn't happen unless there were about 200 simultaneous failures of protective systems.
