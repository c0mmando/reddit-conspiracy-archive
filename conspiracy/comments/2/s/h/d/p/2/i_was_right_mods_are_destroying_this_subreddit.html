       Y'know...I don't know you or your intentions but you do shed light on Rule #10.

       It's usually

       enforced when it comes to insulting users. Something I've had an issue with before. But when it comes to:

      <p>
       This seems like any submission that is pointing out possible wrongdoing in this subreddit in regards to moderation can be removed.

      <p>
       That's not good.

       A conspiracy subreddit really doesn't need any rules, to be honest.  The only rule it would need should be "no spam".  Let the upvoting and downvoting do the rest.

       Easy to say that about a sub whose voting
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       so blatantly and extensively manipulated and attacked as this one is.  Giving trolls free reign to say and post whatever they want is a really terrible idea.  I think we've had this same discussion before.

       I don't think so.  I've been a user of this sub for 2 years and held the same opinion then.  I much prefer when every post isn't bombarded with downvotes and trolls slinging shit around and muddying the discussion to the point that nobody has the energy to keep arguing.  This would be many times worse if these people knew that they wouldn't be punished for behaving that way.

       Well sure, that's very common.  This is precisely why our automod is set to catch comments from any users with accounts under 3 days old.  You would be amazed at how many troll comments get picked up with this and the users banned before they're able to spread the nonsense you mentioned.  Also, if you're going to troll a subreddit, you have a lot more credibility in doing so with an account that's 2 years old as opposed to 2 days.  Point being that we attempt to make it as difficult as possible for trolls to gain a foothold here while still trying to allow people to say and post what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see what the benefit could possibly be of giving trolls and shills free reign here.  You think that would improve the quality of the sub?  If so, please explain.  The only possible argument I can see is if you think we ban legitimate users in addition to trolls but my response to that would be that we do all we can to avoid this and we do reconsider/lift bans if we collectively determine they were unjust or if the user explains themselves and seems sincere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't see this as an argument, just a discussion among two people who ultimately seem to be after the same thing which is a place on reddit where you're free to discuss what you want with people who share similar interests.

       Fair enough, but there needs to be a balance.  Letting trolls run amok here on what's one of the most heavily gamed and attacked subreddits on this entire site just has horrible idea written all over it.  We would be over-run within a week or two once these groups got wind of the fact that we were doing nothing to prevent them from shitting all over the sub.  I think most of the users here are aware of and understand that, I know that I did before I became a mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're of course free to disagree but I really don't see our policies on trolls changing very much going forward, personal attacks and shit posts add nothing of value.  People don't want to discuss a topic if all they get in return are insults.

       He is a pretty clear troll, his other post was a self post very similar to this one where he pretty much whined about this sub censoring too much and claimed that anyone who doesn't agree with "our theories" is called a sheep and banned.

       Catch 22....and the breaking of rule number 2....which just caused me to break rule number 2 as well....oh, well...it's not like rule 11 isn't 99% of all post anyway. Damn mods, rule 10, again..oh, no rule 2 again....look at this link to another sub/use/mod explaining this conundrum in more detail...oh, wait...rule 9....wait a second...Rule 1 seems like it's broken ever single post...unless, you're meant to be specifically derisive...and not direct or playful with your slurs?? Social order?? What the fuck is that?? Are you guys saying I can't speak ill of socialites or feudal serfs? Social Creed? All that bullshit in rule 1 and you end it with no making fun of the Methodist Churches specific social contract?? I think the rules in this sub need a revision. There are ridiculously inept.

       "All of the safety rules here are written in blood"

       Rule 2 is similar to that IIRC.  It came after a conspiratard campaign of complaining about rule 1 violations for perceived anti-semitic comments.  i.e. saying anything negative against Netanyahu, zionism or Israel.

       Its literally never used this way. When someone comes here and attacks everyone indirectly with statements like "this sub is a den of schizophrenics!" Or "you're all antisemitic!" Or "welcome to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       , where tin foil is more valuable than gold" is when we use the "attacking the sub" clause.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time rule 10 is used to protect a mod is in the same context its used to protect a regular subscriber, like when people show up to say "Flytape is just a stormfront agent here to destroy this sub" which is untrue and adds nothing to the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a user once actually presented a big conspiracy theory about me "trying to gain control of
       <a href="/r/stormfront">
        /r/stormfront
       </a>
       " I left the post up. I defended myself and my actions like a normal person and I did not envoke rule 10 until days later when the OP of that witch hunt started going after Amos_Quito calling him a Nazi Holocaust denier etc etc for no damn reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all still exist and has never been removed. Search for the flytape soccer conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before that witch hunt fires back up, my intention was to negotiate a trade between two opposing groups who were squatting on subs the opposite group wanted.  Xkcd on one side and stormfront on the other.

       Yup! You are about to be shadobanned for what you are doing. The worst people possible control this place, and they really do not like that being pointed out. They also used to automatically shadowban accounts under x number of days old, so you might want to get a bunch of alts ready for what is coming your way. The funny part is when some retarded jackass points out how old your account is, as if that means you just got to reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, keep up the good fight. Its good to see that there are people around here who see whats going on. Most of these people are too fucking stupid.

       They aren't the same thing at all and you saying they are shows me you have no idea what you're talking about.  In one instance, you are fully aware that you were banned and you only aren't allowed to post in a specific sub but can still use reddit normally everywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the other instance, you're banned sitewide, you aren't told that you were banned, and you can still do and post anything you want but have no clue that whatever you do is invisible to everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not even remotely the same thing and, again, mods have no ability to give out shadowbans.

       I've never heard of such thing as a subreddit specific shadowban but if they do exist, they aren't something that moderators have control over which is the central point and which is the claim you originally made that I disagreed with.  Maybe there's something funky we could do with the automod to automatically delete a user's posts or something like that but that's very different from how a shadowban would work.

       what are you, 15 years old? dont worry, nobody is upset at you. you simply dont know what you are talking about, but im sure you are used to that. Yes the mods can shadowban users from only this subreddit. It happens all the time. The implementation is irrelevant, Im sure its not exactly teh same mechanism of a site wide shadowban, but any intelligent person would understand it is the exact same effect. You are just pissed because you dont know everything. You are going to have a hard time in life with that attitude kid....

       What are you basing this assertion on?  Because I've been on reddit for two years and have never heard anything like what you're talking about mentioned once, nor have I since becoming a mod here.  So where did you see or hear about this?  I'm legitimately curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've given me no real reason to take you at your word and you insulting me doesn't give you any credibility.  You're the one cursing and telling me I'm an idiot and yet I'm the one who's pissed?  Haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: It sounds like what you're talking about is if we just set up automod to auto-delete a user's comments, like how we have it set up to block any users with accounts that aren't 3 days old.  But again, this
       <em>
        is not
       </em>
       the same thing as a shadowban.  I apologize for the confusion if this is what you're referring to.

       Im just responding to you this way because you were kind of a dick when you approached me. You probably shouldnt act like everyone else is stupid just because you dont understand something - because you dont know everything. Nobody is upset at you, because nobody cares about some incorrect bullshit by some anonymous person on the interwebs. I dont know how its implemented, and I dont give a shit. Its a simple fact of reality that this happens around here. And it feels exactly like a shadowban because the users posts appear for the user, yet they dont appear to anyone else. And frankly, I dont really care if you believe me or not. Good luck!

       It doesn't happen here though, is the point.  If you have an example please do let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that's close to what you're saying that happens here is that our automod catches accounts that are 3 days old or younger to prevent the large number of trolls who constantly create new ones.  Other than that, we give normal bans and the users are made aware they've been banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I apologize if I came off like a dick but, to be honest, you have too.  Cheers though man, I hope our next conversation, if we ever have one, will be a bit less antagonistic.

       It absolutely happens here, flydick for one does it all the time. The mods here are the worst in all of reddit, they are racist and allow the worst kind of content while banning important stuff.
       <strong>
        If you point this out you will be shadowbanned from here
       </strong>
       this is an absolute fact of reality. You dont know what you are talking about.

       I am a mod here, what important stuff do you think we ban?  There are almost no posts that get deleted here at all.  I think a lot of our users would completely disagree with what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have never once seen flytape use automod to "shadowban" a user here but again, if you know of a specific user (just one even) I would be curious to look into it a bit more.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of now this is just you saying it happens while me, a mod, have never seen it happen once and I'm on this sub almost every day.  This doesn't mean you're wrong but it does mean that I'm going to take my own personal experience over your word unless you have something to back it up with because it kinda sounds like you just have a vendetta against flytape and/or feel like arguing.

       How long have you been a mod here? If you are telling the truth, you might be the most clueless mod here. A lot of your users are too ignorant to know whats going on, or maybe they are too busy masturbating to bigfoot, ufos, or da jews to even care, so spare me of your consensus control bullshit. Maybe you are not racist enough, and the white power mods dont let you in on their tricks. The mods here promote racist content, and complete and total bullshit - they ban posts that do not fit their agenda. When it is pointed out that the mods are worthless and racist, people get shadowbanned. This has happened over a dozen times that I remember. Just watch /new sometimes and you will see people bitching about it, but look quickly, they get 'moderated' quite fast. Ive been in contact with several people its occurred to, this is a fact of reality around here. The mods are worthless and racist and run this place with an iron fist. No dissent will be tolerated. Im just going to assume by what you say that you have absolutely no idea what goes on here, and no idea what flycock does, and by our previous conversations im not confident you would be able to know what they are even doing. In fact you are probably just playing dumb, because of how bad the situation actually is. As far as I am concerned you are worthless. Get back to me when you abolish the racist mods who ban people for pointing out how terrible they are. I wont hold my breath.

       What do you mean "promote racist content"?  Do you mean that because this sub allows posts critical of Israel to stand that that means we are racist?  Or that because people make posts questioning the details of WWII that the sub promotes racism?  Because aside from those topics I have no idea what you could be referring to, and neither of those things I mentioned make a person racist by default.

       What topics do you think are banned here?  You keep making these vague accusations but you aren't substantiating them in any way or even being specific as to what you're talking about.  It makes it hard to take you seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub is as horrible and racist and censorship heavy as you're claiming, how have you not been banned yet?  You've been ranting about how shitty we are for hours now and yet here you are.  Why hasn't "flycock" dropped the ban hammer yet?  Just biding his time?  I mean, you say yourself that "no dissent will be tolerated" and that it gets "moderated quite fast".

       If you dont know what racism is, or what racism goes on around here, Im going to go with the fact that you are just a racist. That is likely the only way you got to be a mod. And no, I havent really said anything yet. And besides, the fact that you are here being clueless may make the jackasses think twice about showing you their ass. But really I suspect you are just playing dumb. Are you a teenager too?

       What can AutoModerator do?
      </p>
      <p>
       AutoModerator is commonly used to:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Shadowban" users and/or websites from your subreddit
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         User Shadowban List
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Often, it may be advantageous to shadowban a troll or spammer rather than ban them - an actual ban simply tells them that it's time to create a new account. With a shadowban, they don't know they've been banned.
       </p>

       Yeah, I found that too.  That's why I've said about 3 or 4 times that it can be done through automod.  You'll notice that "shadowban" there is in quotes - this is because what it's doing is not the same as an actual shadowban, although it does function similarly (which I admitted to and already apologized for the confusion).

       No it isn't, that's in fact exactly what it does.  It just doesn't let the user know that their posts have been deleted and in that way is similar to a sitewide shadowban.  I've already admitted that I misunderstood your initial point and have apologized for it multiple times, you may do well to follow your own advice.

       It actually doesnt delete them, it removes them from the subreddit, but they still exist for the user. If you had actually known about that you wouldnt have argued that shadowbanning did not exist in this context. Again, nice try.

       True, but then again those people are easy to weed out. Its way too easy for someone to be labelled a holocaust denier just because they question something about the official story.

       And sometimes, even those spammers, they might have a point or two. Im not saying they are accurate with their conclusions, or their bias, or their respect for other races, but some of the points they bring up beg for further investigstion. This further investigation is

       Its similar to the marijuana debocle. There is evidence that it can help with cancer patients, but (at least until recently) further studies were not allowed because of the controlled substance act. How do we know for sure if we dont investigate? Even if we "know" what the results will be? Sometimes surprises can be found in the most unexpected of places.

       If it's so "easy to demonstrate", why is it a
       <em>
        crime
       </em>
       to even
       <em>
        question it

       Easy to say that about a sub whose voting
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       so blatantly and extensively manipulated and attacked as this one is.  Giving trolls free reign to say and post whatever they want is a really terrible idea.  I think we've had this same discussion before.

       What are you talking about?  You also made a self post trolling the sub and it's mods/users?  I was referring to this OP, this thread, not your comment above.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you personally would probably get at least a bit more leeway in a situation like that anyway since you've been a known user of this sub for a long time whereas this OP is on a 4 day old account.

       Yeah, I found that too.  That's why I've said about 3 or 4 times that it can be done through automod.  You'll notice that "shadowban" there is in quotes - this is because what it's doing is not the same as an actual shadowban, although it does function similarly (which I admitted to and already apologized for the confusion).
