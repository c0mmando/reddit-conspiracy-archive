<p>This seems like any submission that is pointing out possible wrongdoing in this subreddit in regards to moderation can be removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well sure, that&#39;s very common.  This is precisely why our automod is set to catch comments from any users with accounts under 3 days old.  You would be amazed at how many troll comments get picked up with this and the users banned before they&#39;re able to spread the nonsense you mentioned.  Also, if you&#39;re going to troll a subreddit, you have a lot more credibility in doing so with an account that&#39;s 2 years old as opposed to 2 days.  Point being that we attempt to make it as difficult as possible for trolls to gain a foothold here while still trying to allow people to say and post what they want.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see what the benefit could possibly be of giving trolls and shills free reign here.  You think that would improve the quality of the sub?  If so, please explain.  The only possible argument I can see is if you think we ban legitimate users in addition to trolls but my response to that would be that we do all we can to avoid this and we do reconsider/lift bans if we collectively determine they were unjust or if the user explains themselves and seems sincere.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t see this as an argument, just a discussion among two people who ultimately seem to be after the same thing which is a place on reddit where you&#39;re free to discuss what you want with people who share similar interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, but there needs to be a balance.  Letting trolls run amok here on what&#39;s one of the most heavily gamed and attacked subreddits on this entire site just has horrible idea written all over it.  We would be over-run within a week or two once these groups got wind of the fact that we were doing nothing to prevent them from shitting all over the sub.  I think most of the users here are aware of and understand that, I know that I did before I became a mod.</p>

<p>You&#39;re of course free to disagree but I really don&#39;t see our policies on trolls changing very much going forward, personal attacks and shit posts add nothing of value.  People don&#39;t want to discuss a topic if all they get in return are insults.</p>

<p>Its literally never used this way. When someone comes here and attacks everyone indirectly with statements like &quot;this sub is a den of schizophrenics!&quot; Or &quot;you&#39;re all antisemitic!&quot; Or &quot;welcome to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, where tin foil is more valuable than gold&quot; is when we use the &quot;attacking the sub&quot; clause.</p>

<p>The only time rule 10 is used to protect a mod is in the same context its used to protect a regular subscriber, like when people show up to say &quot;Flytape is just a stormfront agent here to destroy this sub&quot; which is untrue and adds nothing to the discussion.</p>

<p>When a user once actually presented a big conspiracy theory about me &quot;trying to gain control of <a href="/r/stormfront">/r/stormfront</a>&quot; I left the post up. I defended myself and my actions like a normal person and I did not envoke rule 10 until days later when the OP of that witch hunt started going after Amos_Quito calling him a Nazi Holocaust denier etc etc for no damn reason.  </p>

<p>It all still exist and has never been removed. Search for the flytape soccer conspiracy.</p>

<p>And before that witch hunt fires back up, my intention was to negotiate a trade between two opposing groups who were squatting on subs the opposite group wanted.  Xkcd on one side and stormfront on the other.</p>

They also used to automatically shadowban accounts under x number of days old, so you might want to get a bunch of alts ready for what is coming your way. The funny part is when some retarded jackass points out how old your account is, as if that means you just got to reddit. </p>

No you are not informed when you are shadowbanned from a specific subreddit, it is <em>exactly</em> like a site wide shadow ban except it is localized to a single subreddit. You are not informed, you are allowed to continue posting - your posts just do not appear. </p>

<p>what are you, 15 years old? dont worry, nobody is upset at you. you simply dont know what you are talking about, but im sure you are used to that. Yes the mods can shadowban users from only this subreddit. It happens all the time. The implementation is irrelevant, Im sure its not exactly teh same mechanism of a site wide shadowban, but any intelligent person would understand it is the exact same effect. You are just pissed because you dont know everything. You are going to have a hard time in life with that attitude kid....</p>

<p>You&#39;ve given me no real reason to take you at your word and you insulting me doesn&#39;t give you any credibility.  You&#39;re the one cursing and telling me I&#39;m an idiot and yet I&#39;m the one who&#39;s pissed?  Haha.</p>

<p>Edit: It sounds like what you&#39;re talking about is if we just set up automod to auto-delete a user&#39;s comments, like how we have it set up to block any users with accounts that aren&#39;t 3 days old.  But again, this <em>is not</em> the same thing as a shadowban.  I apologize for the confusion if this is what you&#39;re referring to.</p>

<p>Im just responding to you this way because you were kind of a dick when you approached me. You probably shouldnt act like everyone else is stupid just because you dont understand something - because you dont know everything. Nobody is upset at you, because nobody cares about some incorrect bullshit by some anonymous person on the interwebs. I dont know how its implemented, and I dont give a shit. Its a simple fact of reality that this happens around here. And it feels exactly like a shadowban because the users posts appear for the user, yet they dont appear to anyone else. And frankly, I dont really care if you believe me or not. Good luck! </p>

<p>The only thing that&#39;s close to what you&#39;re saying that happens here is that our automod catches accounts that are 3 days old or younger to prevent the large number of trolls who constantly create new ones.  Other than that, we give normal bans and the users are made aware they&#39;ve been banned.</p>

<p>I apologize if I came off like a dick but, to be honest, you have too.  Cheers though man, I hope our next conversation, if we ever have one, will be a bit less antagonistic.</p>

A lot of your users are too ignorant to know whats going on, or maybe they are too busy masturbating to bigfoot, ufos, or da jews to even care, so spare me of your consensus control bullshit. Maybe you are not racist enough, and the white power mods dont let you in on their tricks. The mods here promote racist content, and complete and total bullshit - they ban posts that do not fit their agenda. When it is pointed out that the mods are worthless and racist, people get shadowbanned. This has happened over a dozen times that I remember. Just watch /new sometimes and you will see people bitching about it, but look quickly, they get &#39;moderated&#39; quite fast. Ive been in contact with several people its occurred to, this is a fact of reality around here. The mods are worthless and racist and run this place with an iron fist. No dissent will be tolerated. Im just going to assume by what you say that you have absolutely no idea what goes on here, and no idea what flycock does, and by our previous conversations im not confident you would be able to know what they are even doing. In fact you are probably just playing dumb, because of how bad the situation actually is. As far as I am concerned you are worthless. Get back to me when you abolish the racist mods who ban people for pointing out how terrible they are. I wont hold my breath. </p>

<p>What do you mean &quot;promote racist content&quot;?  Do you mean that because this sub allows posts critical of Israel to stand that that means we are racist?  Or that because people make posts questioning the details of WWII that the sub promotes racism?  Because aside from those topics I have no idea what you could be referring to, and neither of those things I mentioned make a person racist by default.</p>

<p>What topics do you think are banned here?  You keep making these vague accusations but you aren&#39;t substantiating them in any way or even being specific as to what you&#39;re talking about.  It makes it hard to take you seriously.</p>

<p>If this sub is as horrible and racist and censorship heavy as you&#39;re claiming, how have you not been banned yet?  You&#39;ve been ranting about how shitty we are for hours now and yet here you are.  Why hasn&#39;t &quot;flycock&quot; dropped the ban hammer yet?  Just biding his time?  I mean, you say yourself that &quot;no dissent will be tolerated&quot; and that it gets &quot;moderated quite fast&quot;.</p>

<p>What can AutoModerator do?</p>

<p>AutoModerator is commonly used to:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Shadowban&quot; users and/or websites from your subreddit</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>User Shadowban List</strong><br/>
Often, it may be advantageous to shadowban a troll or spammer rather than ban them - an actual ban simply tells them that it&#39;s time to create a new account. With a shadowban, they don&#39;t know they&#39;ve been banned.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t, that&#39;s in fact exactly what it does.  It just doesn&#39;t let the user know that their posts have been deleted and in that way is similar to a sitewide shadowban.

<p>And sometimes, even those spammers, they might have a point or two.

<p>Its similar to the marijuana debocle.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I found that too.  That&#39;s why I&#39;ve said about 3 or 4 times that it can be done through automod.  You&#39;ll notice that &quot;shadowban&quot; there is in quotes - this is because what it&#39;s doing is not the same as an actual shadowban, although it does function similarly (which I admitted to and already apologized for the confusion).</p>
