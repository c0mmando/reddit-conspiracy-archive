    <div class="md"><p>Courts don&#39;t need absolute truth to give out a verdict. They need a &quot;preponderance of evidence&quot; and a sympathetic jury. </p>

<p>Preponderance of evidence means that there&#39;s enough evidence for the jury to believe that it&#39;s the tiniest bit more likely than not that the plaintiff is correct. Onset of autism symptoms at what appears to be the same time as a vaccination fits that bill. A jury doesn&#39;t have to be smart, and a good lawyer will be able to orchestrate a jury that doesn&#39;t need much convincing in order to issue a judgment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Same standard applies, though. I cite Wikipedia, which was citing the New England Journal of Medicine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To win an award, a claimant must show a causal connection; if medical records show a child has one of several listed adverse effects soon after vaccination, the assumption is that it was caused by the vaccine. The burden of proof is the civil-law preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, in other words a showing that causation was more likely than not. Denied claims can be pursued in civil courts, though this is rare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the onset of symptoms at the same time as a vaccination fits the standard of proof required by law, but that&#39;s easily random chance that they coincide. Court judgments are not proof of anything,  based on the standard required by law. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the federal government has already conceded that vaccine injury that results in brain damage can also include autism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is based on the fact that the court is awarding a judgment, then it&#39;s equally invalid. I&#39;ve established that the standard of law for awarding includes no scientific proof of any link between vaccines and autism. A court following the law as written (as well it should) does not mean that the federal government has established any link or proof. The law may be faulty, or it may just happen to be convenient help for these families with children with autism, based on  their situation (note that I&#39;m not necessarily saying that they are bad people,  but simply that the coincidence of law quirks and medical conditions benefit them). There&#39;s no scientific proof. No medical proof. Nothing of consequence.  </p>

<p>But you&#39;ve failed to mention <em>why</em> that is the case. Congress enacted <a href="https://www.texmed.mobi/Template.aspx?id=4627">NVICA</a> to protect the the interests (profits) of vaccine manufacturers. That&#39;s why the science is being buried by CDC and no vax vs unvax studies exist. The organizations and individuals with the means (and tasked with the public responsibility) to fund this expensive research don&#39;t want to touch it. Instead the CDC funds bad research that only further discredits the organization. Paid shills like Dr. Insel at the NIMH block those proposals with their blanket denials.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/22/breaking-cdc-whistleblower-thompson-in-grave-danger-now/">Thompson blew the whistle at the CDC and is now keeping a low profile.</a>. This is <em>really</em> how the world works, believe it or not...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don´t live my daily life in a courtroom scenario. I don´t need to know about all the ins and outs of the legal system. The legal system doesn´t have anything to do with the simple truth.

From the outside looking in, anyone who wants to shame, ridicule, coerce, or nag others into accepting what they don´t want for themselves or their families is in the wrong and should shut the hell up. If you want it for you and yours - by all means do it. Leave everyone else alone in peace. </p>

<p>The underlying theme here is that there are certain types of people who just can not accept no as an answer, and insist that they know more about what is better for everyone on the planet in every situation. If their weak argument can´t suffice - they will move directly to ridicule, then coercion, then force. Those types should be avoided and ignored - for despite their attempts to sound overly smart and clever - they are no more than simple thugs. </p>

<p>Except herd immunity is a thing. People who choose not to vaccinate without a legitimate medical reason (like an allergy to a component of the vaccine) are wilfully compromising that for no reason other than &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot;. That&#39;s wrong. Until someone can provide me with real scientific proof (instead of circumstantial BS), I&#39;m not going to shut up. People who choose to put other kids at risk over willful ignorance should be shamed and ridiculed. People like that are just plain stupid. I will not leave someone alone in peace if they are risking kids&#39; safety.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not the one who did scientific research. I&#39;m not the one with the know-how to determine causation.  I do know that the people who have this knowledge have shown their work and their methods are sound. Anyone who is &quot;anti-vax&quot; has done no such work, and are given the appropriate amount of credibility.  </p>

<p>Also,</p>
