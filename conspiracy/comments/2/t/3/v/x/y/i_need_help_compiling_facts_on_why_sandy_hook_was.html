       In the description you will see a link to parker family blog where they try a little damage control and she admits to photo shopping her dead child into the photos she gave to the media(fairly cryptic if it were real).

       The wig one was good too. But still, none of these really show anything but peripheral anomalies.  I'd like to have a top 10 list and put some at the bottom, because there's a lot of sandy hook trash. but these anomalies are interesting.

       Very good.  Anyone given the facts shifts their belief to the more likely truth almost immediately.  They fucked up this op so bad, the masses are now awake to their lies.  The implications are sickening, but no less true regardless of that fact.

       Not to sound like a shilly goose here, but your green screen clips boil down to an object you don't know what it is (therefore green screen?) and a guy visibly shifting his weight (note the changes in the surface of his jeans).
      </p>
      <p>
       You may unintentionally be spreading disinformation in the form of not only false claims, but false claims which wouldn't mean much even if they were true.

       Take you first "green screen" link- lets detail the issues
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        what's the purpose of the use of a green screen?
       </li>
       <li>
        why capture the people going through the scene and claim there a green screen camera there? absurd. Shows that the guy has no technical understanding of what he is even alleging.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        were they going to reuse the corridore and have the people walk through it again later? It makes no sense.
       </li>
       <li>
        is he says that's the projector? They walk in front of it.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Pretty much EVERY piece of sandy hook shit I have seen is as ludicrously flawed as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I say, this is right wing blowhard fantasy self diddling... NOT skepticism, NOT intelligent, NOT thoughtful. it's a ludicrous embarrassment to the real see thinking. it's for right wings suckers to be afraid Obammy is going to take their cap guns away...

       I'll never question Sandy Hook again if someone could please tell me the joke that was so funny that a father of a child lost couldn't help but bust a gut, not 24 hours after the event took place, shit it was that evening. No one that has ever been a parent, ever, does that. That's just not how it works, not how any of this works...

       I upvoted ya man, it was a question that led me to posting the video. As relivent as it gets. Some ppl that are here, arn't from around here, if that makes sense, and they try to make things appear as they arent. to keep you from asking questions, and then maybe seeing some shocking evidence. you'll notice that video had no lead in, no music, just what was aired on t.v. for you to digest. =)

       I remeber when this all happened. My first thought? Unimaginable grief. Believe it or not, just because I subscribe to r/conspiracy I don't just assume everything is a conspiracy just after it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wait for the facts to come out, then the questions, then I start to make decisions about the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that was when I saw that video. Jaw hit the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I showed it to a coworker of mine. Not a conspiracy theorist at all. Not really even an informed voter. Had a child about the age of the children at Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think she just watched it to humor her likeable conspiracy theorist coworker/friend. She even said, " Well, in situations like that you never really know how a parent will react. They can do all kinds of weird stuff".
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't look once at the video as I showed it to her. Just studied her facial expressions. They went from "putting up with this politely" to "what the fucking fuck did I just see" just like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the fact we had worked and sat next to each other for over a year at this point, and that she always rolled her eyes at my "conspiracy" shit...She was a little fucked up after seeing that.

       some ppl don't like being woke up. alot don't like fallin down any rabbit holes. Ppl don't want to believe something like this would be faked. they don't want to think they mourned over a show. it's alot easier for em to accept that us tin foil hats are reading into things. But how you read into the guy praticing his lines on top of that last vid i posted. i mean, idk what happened that day, but there's no way something bullshit happened because look at all this strange bullshit. Did the illuminati kill Robin Williams. I doubt it. But who knows? Was Sandy Hook just a school shooting. Fuck no, no way. Way too evidence to point that something other than the offical story told happened. Idk wht it was. idk who was involved. but there is a stank of fishy all over the incidents of that day.

       My dad laughed at his father's funeral, several times. Many jokes and stories were told that made us laugh even through the tears. Different people cope different ways.

       the situation is diffrent. your father's father was old. he lived a life. that was a lil kid. you're so full of shit if you think your dad would be laughing at your funeral, certainally doubled down on if you were less than 10 years old.  Triple if a loon shot you at school. plz.

       That's not the point of my comment. My point was simply that everyone grieves differently. You have no idea how every father would react in every situation, and it is absolutely proof of nothing that he laughed the day his son died.

       So I should accept that RP was laughing out of remorse for his daughter that was shot hours ago by a crazed gun man, because that's certainly more plausiable, and it is what that master nbc told ya, right? I half agree with you, you're not debunking anything. I say look at the evidence presented, decide for yourself. you accuse me of jumping to conclusions, but the only one that's looking froggy is you =)

       Compared to what? Him being one of dozens (if not hundreds) of paid actors working in tandem with one another in a false flag perpetrated by the government? If that's your alternative proposal, then yes. It is objectively a more likely scenario.

       Your comparing a normal adults reaction to an (assumingly) elderly man's death, that was expected. Parker was full on laughing the night his 6 year old daughter was supposedly brutally shot multiple times. That isn't an acceptable comparison.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       troll and discourages everyone here from thinking outside mainstream narratives.  I have the user tagged and if you look into its account history you will witness an abnormal amount of naysaying, sarcasm, and mean spirited arguments.
       <br/>
       That being said, your family probably CAN see what you see, they just don't want to (yet).  Its your job to make them want to.  Don't go on the offensive.  You won't convince your family by jumping up and down and being loud.  Get well versed in Sandy Hook or whatever event it is you're questioning.  Be able to assert beyond pure speculation. Wait for your moment, wait until someone else brings it up, and use one or two bits of evidence you find most convincing in disproving the official narrative and drive them home, in a calm, cool manner as if it isn't even a big deal to you.  I think if you pull this off, your family will be more inspired than they are now to look into it for themselves.  I'm pretty sure anyone who seriously looks into these events from an objective standpoint without using exclusively mainstream sources will come away more awake to the truth.  Remember, the key is to not freak out when you're giving your opinion, not get offended when they retaliate (for you will have offended them by speaking the truth), and to know what you're talking about.  Also, once you've planted the seed, don't drown it.  Take advantage of when they prompt you with questions, but in general, Its way cooler and easier to be sure of ONE thing than argue over a lot of things you might not know as well.  Don't let anyone strawman you, stay on topic!  Finally, remember that with all these events, we don't actually know what really happened, don't offer explanation, only present evidence proving the official narrative to be absurd, because it almost always is.

       It's not "your job" to do anything, least of all to evangalise for people on Youtube. Believe what you like, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

       What do they lose if you can't persuade your family to accept this stuff, and they get angry / upset with you? Absolutely nothing.

       Friday mornin' at the school you couldn't see him arrive (no video)

      <p>
       He stood six foot nothing and weighed one twelve dripping wet (off the BMI charts)
      </p>
      <p>
       Kinda narrow at the shoulder and narrow at the hip

      <p>
       Nobody seemed to know where Adam got his tactical training.
      </p>
      <p>
       He just went to the arcade and danced for ten hours
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
      </p>
      <p>

       The two greatest resources that I was able to share with my friends and family were:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook" and "Sandy Hook: Creating A Reality, A Peter Klein Redux Of A Sofia Smallstorm Presentation".
      </p>
      <p>
       They are clear, concise and present the facts without undermining the information with predisposed bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you aren't able to locate them, send me a PM and I'll upload the full 1080p videos and send you a link.

       I personally haven't bought into it. It was laced with right wing fantasies. Where's the gun confiscation and FEMA camps??? I haven't been sent to one yet, have you? This whole conspiracy reminds me of Truckers Ride to Shut Down America - a very few blowhards with juvenile fantasies.

       i'm a middle of the road politico. that is to say, i don't lean too heavy to either side. let's call it a moderate, for all intensive purproses. I questioned what happened that day. I don't fear guns being taken outta the home, or ppl being round up into fema camps. I do see that they can use this, and did, to take a lil more of the firearms outta ppls hands. clip size, type, etc. just a lil more here, a lil more there. til they get it downgraded to civilians only using pellet guns. If you didn't see that happen, you wern't paying attention.

       Here's another angle - the "body double" fantasy.  I think this is the one where that stated.  This guy looks like that guy and so on... Yeah everyone looks like everyone.   Have you ever noticed there's always things that don't match that are overlooked? You can find a prime example of this insanity taken to the extreme with the scribd file claiming the Boston bombing crew is an Albanian family.

       I'm open to any opinion, does that make me crazy? I have seen evidence over time that makes me doubt the legitimacy behind Sandy Hook, so I want to gather information about it. Not crazy really.

       Just because Big Brother tells ya something, doesn't make it true. And if it does for you, then you are what Orwell said would be the death of the human experince. So congrats on that.

       That said, @ Paris, don't stress your family out by pushing conspiracy in thier face. Ppl never like being woke up early =) they tend to be grouchy.
