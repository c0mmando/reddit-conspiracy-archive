        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I realized something recently. When I was a kid, the FBI visited our school to &quot;teach&quot; us all about what they do. As a fun exercise, they had all the kids stamp their fingerprints. Then we had a field trip a week later to their local office where they took our pictures. Not until I was an adult did I realize what they were doing. We are put into the system at a young age. </p>

<p>Granted, in some cases this could be beneficial, but we were all put into a database without even knowing why. I thought it was a fun thing as a kid, knowing how they did things and found criminals. But I realize now that they were just exploiting our ignorance.</p>

<p>What if, as a child, I said I didn&#39;t want to participate in the exercise? What if I said I didn&#39;t want to stamp my fingerprints? Of course, as a kindergartner, I had no idea. But that&#39;s the point. Kids don&#39;t know. Kids can&#39;t say no to a fun activity.</p>

<p>Anyway, did anyone else have this experience? Did the FBI take you, as a little ignorant child, to their local offices as a fun little field trip? Stamp your fingerprints? Looking back I realize how awful this was. Of course nowadays our fingerprints are scanned into our driver license, which I absolutely agree with. But before this they used children? What the fuck?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happened to me in 2001 when I was in Middle School. It was kind of scary. My dad is and was a conspiracy theorist with strong beliefs on privacy and national surveillance. They did exactly what you said. They came to our school, and gave a presentation on kidnapped children. They drove their campaign simply on fear tactics. And all the kids got in line immediately. I on the other hand, asked to use the bathroom and stayed there until the next school bell rang. I told my dad about it that night, and you can imagine his response. The next day, I arrived at school and the principal was standing outside waiting for me, everyone went to class and I went into her office. The FBI agents were sitting there too. They told me that the school has adopted their policies, and has made it mandatory for kids who attend this school to participate in the program. I got scared and didn&#39;t want to get in trouble, with my principal and the FBI telling me to cooperate, and I did. Fast forward 15 years and now im in college and I had forgotten about that. Your post reminded me. Brings back uncomfortable memories... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>never seen the FBI when i was in school, but i remember the same &quot;activity&quot; being a part of DARE when i was in 6th grade. we put our fingerprints on little index cards, but i can&#39;t remember if they actually took them, or if we got to take them home.</p>

<p>on the other hand, when i was a freshman in high school, some asshole motorcycle cop was parked in this spot on a street right outside the school. he was hiding around the corner, waiting for kids to come by driving too fast, or in my case, <em>riding a bike without a helmet</em>. he gave me a ticket which came out to $279... keep in mind i was hardly even on the bike, i was kinda riding it like a scooter, standing up with one foot on the pedal just leaning into it. it was what you might do if you were walking with your bike, pushing it along, and you hit a downhill road. might as well <em>slightly</em> hop on and ride it like a shopping cart.</p>

<p>anyway he gave me a ticket which was fine, but then he took my fingerprints and made me do a DNA swab. i asked if i had the right to refuse, since the DNA swab sounded ridiculous, and he told me that i would be arrested if i didn&#39;t let him stick a swab inside my mouth. orwellian fuck... so i gave him the DNA swab but i fought that ticket in court, believe it or not. i was just 15 years old... it took a whole year, but i got off without paying a single cent. the judge told me to do research on bike accidents, helmet safety, etc. and write an essay on that as well as why i think i was safe without a helmet. (considering that i wasn&#39;t really riding the bike)</p>

<p>the really weird part is that i got arrested for graffiti several years later, and then again for &#39;drunk and disorderly&#39; even though i was on heroin and i wasn&#39;t being &#39;disorderly,&#39; which are definitely more serious crimes than leaning on a bike without wearing a helmet. but both those times, where i was actually arrested and processed and held in a cell for 6 hours, my DNA wasn&#39;t taken. weird, huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do, i specifically remember doing it, and i remember going to get my picture taken, and afterwards they showed us the software they use to put together faces of suspects. Like sketches, but on the computer instead. I have a distinct experience burned into my mind from when that happened, ill never forget it for some reason. I didnt know any better at the time, but when i got older i definitely thought about it. Funny you said something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I seem to remember this being part of a tour my boy scout troop took of our local police station. So, not the FBI, but the same idea, but that&#39;s not even the oddest thing I remember being &quot;off&quot; about my childhood.</p>

<p>Nothing sexual or in that realm. Just has to do with the program they used to mark our reading progress at school. It&#39;s crazy, but my best guess is that someone or a group was taking  a special note of what I was reading. </p>

<p>It may sound like I have a delusional sense of how important I am, but that&#39;s not it. My reasoning starts with the fact that there was one very specific way in which I was instructed to interact with the reading system which was completely different than my classmates.</p>

<p>The program was called AR, which stood for Accelerated Reading. Some of you may be familiar with it, but basically what it was was a system designed to allow students to log into the system, take a test on whatever book they had just read, and earn points based on how well they did. At the end of each quarter you were supposed to have so many points based on your reading level.</p>

<p>Regarding passwords, those were just given to you at the beginning of the the school year in the first grade. Mine happened to be &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. Ok, nothing weird so far.</p>

<p>But then, partway through the second grade, we were at our computers when our teacher informed us that everyone&#39;s password is going to be your last name...except for me. Mine was to stay &quot;Apollo 13&quot; This was never explained to me. Every now and then I&#39;d bring it up and I was told to stop asking. </p>

<p>It could be nothing. It could be that the company responsible for the program wanted to track my usage to improve their product...or anything really. It&#39;s just that it was never explained to me, so I really don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;ll point out is that I was freakishly good at reading right from the start. For instance, I used to get in trouble for reading out loud in class <em>to fast</em>, tested at a college reading level in the 4th grade, etc.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m at the center of a vast conspiracy, it&#39;s just always been weird to me.</p>
