        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Big change is coming <strong>now</strong>.</p>

<p>Geocentrism is not a joke. It&#39;s a weapon.</p>

<p>Atheism has been indoctrinated onto the masses for a reason. They purposefully crafted generations of atheists so that, under their control, we could be steered directly into the hands of Antichrist.</p>

<p>There is a film being released in theaters (which is already out on the west coast) called <a href="http://theprinciplemovie.com">The Principle</a>. Top physicists and cosmologists are at a position where they have to admit we are the center of the universe. They have no choice anymore. There is no fighting it. The same people behind this film are already planning a similar release to show people the scientific evidence demonstrating that the Earth is young... and yes, science confirms the Bible.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/j5UaLJbsTw4?t=40m">Listen to this interview starting at 40:00</a>.</strong> Listen to the way this man speaks about what&#39;s coming. These are Catholics bringing this forward. Catholic doctrine is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unam_sanctam">the whole world must submit to the Pope for salvation</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to pull just this one quote from the interview above:</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Whoever gets to tell the story about reality and creation and the way things really are - that&#39;s the most powerful tool in the world.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The Papacy is coming out of hiding. The Antichrist is beginning her pounce. <strong>The New World Order is real.</strong></p>

<p>They&#39;re using the validity of the Bible to direct people to a false Christ. Revelation told us this was coming.</p>

<p><strong>Call me crazy today, but thank God tomorrow.</strong></p>

<p>They knew what they were talking about. They had to deny it to get the hype going about the film. The controversy raised enough money to put it in theaters and get the word out, which DeLano thanks them for in the interview I posted in the OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science is the mechanism that&#39;s being used here. The fact that cosmologists now have observational and experimental evidence that we are in the center and stationary... that changes everything about the way we look at the world.</p>

<p>There&#39;s much more evidence that the Earth is young. It&#39;s a discussion we can have, but at the moment it&#39;s cosmology that is the focal point. This is life changing information that&#39;s being fed to the mainstream from authoritative faces they&#39;re used to seeing on TV... That&#39;s huge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listened to some of that interview you posted. He doesn&#39;t say that there is observational and experimental evidence. He just states that there has been no proof that is is NOT true. That argument can be made for just about anything. That&#39;s the same shit people say when you ask them for proof on how the bible is true. And they say &quot; well theres no proof it isnt&quot;.</p>

<p>And the earth is young compared to what? Age can be relative as well. Im 23 years old. Compared to a person whos 90, i am young. But compared to someone that was just born, i am old. </p>

<p>So the earth could be extremely extremely old, or it could be extremely young. What are you comparing it to? </p>

<p>New findings suggest the Copernican principle is wrong. That&#39;s the reason the film is called The Principle.</p>

<p>It means the universe is bound and we&#39;re in the center of the whole thing on a stationary Earth. That&#39;s scientifically sound <em>and</em> mind bending.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its all relative, if i go to the moon i can watch the earth spin below me. If i moved all of the equipment they use to view the observable universe 1000 light-years away in any direction to another planet, there would still be no direction in which we are more limited than another. But you would know for a FACT that you weren&#39;t in the previous &quot;center of the observable universe&quot; you were in before. So how can one really say for sure? You can&#39;t.</p>

<p>I believe that the universe, life, consciousness, humans, and the earth, is something sooo far beyond our comprehension that we couldn&#39;t even fathom it. Almost like trying to look at the 4th dimension from the 3rd. </p>

<p>Who knows, what if consciousness is the center of the universe. And the universe is inside of each of us, and its being projected out through our eyes? Whos to say thats not the case? What if consciousness creates reality and not the other way around? What if this really is a computer simulation being ran a thousand years in the future? 
What if all those cave drawing and Egyptian carvings of space ships, was actually us in the future who figured out time travel and went back in time? </p>

<p>You see what im getting at here? The possibilities are so infinite, it&#39;s hard to say that ANY of us know what the fuck any of this is for sure, scientist or not. </p>

<p>We just, don&#39;t, know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re assuming the Copernican principle. The movie is called The Principle because it overturns that very thing... We&#39;re dead center of a spherical universe on a stationary Earth. It&#39;s not just the center of the observable universe, but the center of the entire universe.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what science has discovered. That&#39;s why this is huge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not assuming anything, and i am not cementing my beliefs in any one specific theory. That was the point of my post. </p>

<p>I do believe that there are things greater than us,  that there are higher powers out there who created this universe ( But not in a religious biblical type god kind of way ) and that this life does have meaning, and that there are answers to all of life&#39;s greatest questions out there. I had the most vivid mind blowing experience on DMT. And that experience alone is enough to make me think that no matter what you think you know, your&#39;e probably wrong. So i wont cement my beliefs like i said.</p>

<p>But seriously, before you start cementing your beliefs in this, don&#39;t you think you should like... see the movie first?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... there are scientific experiments and data he talks about. It&#39;s not just a talk.</p>

<p>The CMB scans from <a href="http://magisterialfundies.blogspot.com/2012/09/newest-observational-evidence-shows.html">WMAP and SSDS</a> revealed the Axis of Evil in cosmology, and the <a href="http://magisterialfundies.blogspot.com/2013/03/copernican-principle-1532-2013-rip-why.html">Planck satellite</a> confirmed it when they tried to dismiss it as an error. These show that the Earth is in a preferred location and that the universe is set up specifically to favor the Earth.</p>

<p>Long ago, the Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect the motion of the Earth. Every experiment since has also failed. Michelson-Morley, Airy&#39;s failure, the Sagnac experiment, and Michelson-Gabe build us a picture with a stationary Earth and a rotating universe.</p>

<p>Rather than accept that the Earth was stationary after Michelson-Morley, relativity was created so that they could make it work as if the Earth moves on paper. There still exists no evidence the Earth moves, and we actually with those experiments have evidence that it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Satellites, as he mentions in the interview, are corrected by the Sagnac effect using a geocentric model. NASA admittedly uses a geocentric model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It shows that the universe was made just for us. It means someone created it that way. It sends people searching for God.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the next movie they&#39;re working on is about the age of the Earth. The Bible is entirely confirmed by science at this point. Darwinism is a miserable failure. We can prove the flood. Archaeology confirms the people and places. We can demonstrate geocentrism and a stationary Earth, claimed by the Bible. We can show all the prophecy as true.</p>

<p>If you send people looking for God, ultimately they&#39;ll find the one with proof to back their claims. The Bible is loaded with proof and testable claims because God made it that way on purpose. It was designed to prove to us that He is real, and now science has caught up so that we can do just that.</p>

<p>It was all prophesied to happen this way. Revelation says it all. One world under one government and one religion... headed by a single man - the Pope, who openly claims to be in place of Christ on Earth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all part of God&#39;s plan to save us.</p>

<p>&quot;And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.&quot; <strong>(John 14:29)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.&quot; <strong>(John 20:31)</strong></p>

<p>Im not one to get into religion so im outta this conversation. Once all that bible stuff starts flying around im outta here. Science is hard 100% undeniable fact. Religion and the bible can be interpreted by anyone in a number of different ways. </p>

<p>It cannot be fact, and open for your own personal interpretation at the same time. </p>

<p>No, that&#39;s a problem. Michelson-Gale would impose a static aether and a rotating earth (rotating aether in your world), However MM imposed a static aether with respect to the earth (the lab actually). Only a Lorentzian aether can get out of this. That still leaves you with one extra assumption and no reason why the measured result should have agreed with the prediction.</p>

<p>There is a very significant (hundreds of kilometers per second) motion with respect to the CMB rest frame. In order to keep the world static you have to move the entire universe with no explanation. Proper motion in quasars and stellar parallaxes again requite either the earth to move or distant objects to accelerate (some beyond the speed of light) with respect to earth, again the latter has no justification.  Quotes taken out of context won&#39;t change the science.</p>

<p>No. Nothing has ever been confirmed to move faster than the speed of light. Stellar parallax and quasars do cause a problem because you have no explanation as to why they should do that. In science that just isn&#39;t good enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t prove things in science. The axis of evil does not prove the earth is special, everything has a chance of occurring in probability so you ask &quot;how unlikely is this&quot;. Given the errors in the axis it&#39;s probably not that unlikely. It also wouldn&#39;t prove the earth was special, it would be aligned with the solar system and any planet which shares the inclination.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Or there being no aether with there being no evidence to uniquely support its existence, your entire argument seems to revolve ignoring possibilities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stellar parallax-aberration is geocentric.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The original expressions are not justified or derived, just written down. Without the original motivation the derivation is worthless, there is no way to check if it is physically meaningful or just set up to get the right answer.</p>

<p>Quasars show proper motion due to relativistic aberration, not just round the sun but also the galaxy. The result you posted about time dilation was controversial at the time, a) because it assumes models of quasar variation and b) people weren&#39;t happy with the way it dealt with the fact you do not see the same part of the accretion disk due to k-corrections. People are now using methods with fewer assumption which fit the standard cosmological model (including time dilation).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0612/0612086.pdf">Galileo&#39;s arguments were all wrong</a>. There wasn&#39;t any grounds for believing the Earth moved at the time. Jesuits are the ones behind all of this... so it&#39;s only natural they show up.</p>

<p>The more interesting fact is that Tyco-Brahe had a near flawless geocentric model just before that which blew everything else out of the water. For some reason he died a rather suspicious death and his assistant took his notes to promote a heliocentric model.</p>

<p>As for the authority of the church they so often claim... That I most certainly do not agree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You feel that your life needs explanation and have to affirm that within yourself to have purpose. Thats ok man. Most if not all religion has ties to astrology I cant be convinced of a god or even gods for that matter. </p>

<p>I dont try to persuade others into my way of thinking. I see no reason like religion does all the time. If it were real then there would be no need to convince me or anyone else. Why do you think that is?</p>

<p>Now you want to have affirmation that you were put here at this time for a reason. I dont instead I want to belive that I didnt get here for a purpose instead I will make my own reason thru actions that I control and outcomes I make happen.</p>

<p>I dont feel the need to ask for forgiveness to prior acts that I have committed in order to feel less guilt. Its absurd to me to do that. My actions have made me who I am and I embrace my past good and bad. I see no reason to harbor guilt for it as I did it for a reason at the time.</p>

<p>Now when I die then its over. Why is there a need to feel you have a sence of afterlife? Its because people fear death. I dont understand that in the slightest.  Now to me religion is a form of control. Its merely what is the most popular stories at the time you are alive that you find yourself. </p>

<p>Control is the only real religion.  Thats something you can belive. All thru time man has craved it as its the hardest thing to truly obtain. Its why slavery was so accepted as many can feel a type of control. Humanity is a race that craves control and structure to varying degrees. </p>

<p>We love the illusion of freedom as it lets us feel good about our leaders and nations. We die for those reason by the millions. Because we are told someone else wishes us to not have them when we are made to think that someone else that believes a slightly different religion did the act that imposed our freedom.</p>

<p>Now I would like to hear your side of reasoning. I feel no need to dismiss you. I wont insult your beliefs.  I warn you that there is no way you will convince me out of mine thou. </p>

<p>If you will permit I will ask questions about yours thou.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to sit on my hands and deny reality. God is real, the evidence is everywhere, and He told us to tell people. He left us a revelation of the oppression in this world and where it comes from... culminating here, at the end of time, with the oppressors doing so in His name.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe because I want to or desperately need to. I believe because it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>I, like you guys, am aware that the truth is being kept away from us. There&#39;s injustice in the world. I don&#39;t want to live in this world. Seeking truth in all skepticism, I ultimately found it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s your choice to believe or not. Your salvation is only by believing. Only God has authority over you. He gave us all the information we need. It&#39;s up to us to do our homework and study.</p>

<p>Unfortunately atheism, as ignorant as it is, has been duped on the masses. It&#39;s a cruel joke in the process of reinventing Jesus before selling a dupe made for, you said it, control.</p>

<p>God wants to free us from our bonds, not put a yoke on our neck. That&#39;s the difference here. Faith in the Bible is not superstitious. It&#39;s reasonable, evidence based, logical, and liberating. The oppressor muddies the waters so it&#39;s up to you to seek for yourself.</p>

<p>&quot;The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.&quot; <strong>(Psalm 14:1)</strong></p>

<p>The first step is realizing God is not only possible, He is necessary.</p>
