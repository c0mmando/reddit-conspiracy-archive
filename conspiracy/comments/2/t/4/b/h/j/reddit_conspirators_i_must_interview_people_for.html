        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey reddit conspiracists, I was wondering if I could take a moment of your time to answer 5 questions about conspiracy theories for my class. The questions are as follows: </p>

<p>1.Do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of JFK? If the answer is no, then who else do you believe was involved? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Based on what you know, who carried out the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11? Do you see any reason to question the official version of events that day? </p></li>
<li><p>Have you ever heard of the Illuminati? Do you believe that such an organization exists and if so what do you believe its agenda to be?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you believe the Holocaust really occurred? If not, why? </p></li>
<li><p>Do you believe the government is harboring evidence for the proving of the existence of aliens (or harboring the aliens themselves?) What evidence do you believe proves this?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I want redditor answers for these questions because I believe that you guys and girls will have the most informative and creative answers. Thanks!</p>

<p>edit: chaged conspirators to conspiracists. Thanks, Soverignman!</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks all of you for your wonderful answers, this is more than enough; hope to be a part of this community as I go through the rest of this course!</p>

<p>Really? Why are you here, you obviously don&#39;t come around too much, 2 day user? Now you have a &quot;paper&quot; to write? I have one too, why do dogs smell their piss after pissing? This is a highly reputable paper I&#39;m writing for a highly reputable college, for a highly reputable gov grant and if granted I will do highly reputable search in figuring out why dogs smell their piss after pissing... Piss off.</p>

<p>Iran/Contra</p>

<p>MK Ultra</p>

<p>U.S.S. Liberty</p>

<p>War in Iraq</p>

<p>Patriot Act</p>

<p>Hell, the CIA pushing crack into ghettos is way more interesting than the illuminati, IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of JFK? If the answer is no, then who else do you believe was involved?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all. I believe he worked for the CIA and part of the MKULTRA project.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on what you know, who carried out the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11? Do you see any reason to question the official version of events that day? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Building 7 came down though it wasn&#39;t struck by anything, so yes, I question the official version. As for the attackers, I&#39;m not sure as it could have been an alphabet soup of organizations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever heard of the Illuminati? Do you believe that such an organization exists and if so what do you believe its agenda to be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and I think it does exist, just differently than the original Bavarian version. I think they&#39;re goal is a single global government without liberty, religion, and free thought.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe the Holocaust really occurred? If not, why? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes because there is way too much documentation to support it from orders to films, witness testimony and Nazi papers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe the government is harboring evidence for the proving of the existence of aliens (or harboring the aliens themselves?) What evidence do you believe proves this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favorite area. American government has known of aliens since 1947 from a crash near Roswell, NM. It&#39;s a well researched event that indicates to me that an alien craft crashed or it&#39;s a hoax to protect a very secretive experimental aircraft or spacecraft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Absolutely not.  Over 5 snipers set in different locations, and other backup shooters, were involved in the shot that killed him.  The mafia wanted him gone since JFK was ruining their business.  The CIA wanted him gone since JFK was attempting to dismantle parts of the CIA.  George HW Bush was one of the lead orchestrator.</p>

<p>2) To answer the second part, I don&#39;t see any reason to believe the official version.  Not one.  Who carried out the attacks?  Neocons (Bush, Cheney, Bush Sr, Rumsfeld, Rice, Bremmer, Kissinger, Zelikow just to name some of the key conspirators), select member of the CIA/NSA, the Saudi Royal family, and members of the Mossad. </p>

<p>3) I have heard of the Illuminati.  I think that the concept of wealthy businessmen conspiring to further their personal agendas does exist, but I don&#39;t fully believe that there&#39;s a group of people who control everything on this earth.</p>

<p>4) Yes the holocaust occurred, but there&#39;s reason to believe that the death toll was exaggerated. </p>

<p>5) Can&#39;t say I know enough on the topic to give a reasonable answer.</p>

<p>My friends sister actually took a conspiracy class last semester.  My friends still rip on me for the stuff I believe, but she&#39;s now on my side about 9/11!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never heard of Professor Pressington, but thanks! For question 2, (or the second #1), who do you think carried out the attacks on the WTC? </p>

<p>edit: there was confusion to who I meant when I stated &quot;never heard of him&quot;. Also last1, do you mind speculating as to why you believe LBJ was involved int he assassination of JFK?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You never heard of LBJ? And you&#39;re in college... in a conspiracy class.. hmm..</p>

<p>The illuminati carried out 9/11. They pulled lil puppet strings and made a whole lot of cash not just immediately that day, but in security and defense spending for over the decade to follow. Hell, if anything Osama won. He said he&#39;d make us out spend em so bad to win that we&#39;d lose the empire. Today we&#39;re having to invade the middle east at every point (iraq, afganistan, syria, etc.) just to keep the petro dollar afloat. Our military budget annually is over 650 billion dollars. that&#39;s more than the next 15 nations combined. Russia, Britian, France, Germany, Japan, China, etc etc, would all have to team up, and they&#39;d still be on the losing side when it comes to military resources. the only thing they trump with is man power, and drones even that out easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize I skipped it, LBJ killed JFK for the power. JFK clearly states he was never a fan of LBJ, he was brought in to sooth the southern dems, which at the time were for the most part, not into this whole civil rights thing. JFK loved guys like King. LBJ, not so much. Even if Oswald acted alone to the sense as being the only shots fired that day, he had directions. MKUltra is something you might be intrested in, it shows ya just how corrupt all these guys can get. But yeah, LBJ kills JFK for the Presidency. His first action, to shut down the silver reserve currency and get this Nam thing amped up for the war for the next decade. Military spending goes up, and has stayed up ever since. There is only one lull in the defense budget, and that was ww2 to korea, that&#39;s half a decade. Then once we used up all our crappy ww2 stuff, we were ready to play with our new toys in nam. Sound familar? cause it wouldn&#39;t be the last time america does this. The empire is born, the republic is dead, and ppl cheered it in just like ol&#39; Lucus showed us in the only passable prequel.</p>

But after reading much of the 50th anniversary commentary and interviews (including one with Marina Oswald,) I tend to believe he acted with private NGO (cell) backing without the knowledge of the US State Dept. Not as big a conspiracy as we might believe, but the Warren Report was something of a whitewash.  2017 is coming, and we will learn much more of the truth. </li>
</ol>

<p>2.WTC. Absolutely NOT the &quot;official&quot; version. Who profited?  (Hint: Big Oil/Saudis, Cheneyville.)  No, three airplanes did NOT bring down the WTC buildings without a LOT of internal assistance.  </p>

<p>Illuminati: Much ado about nothing.  Which is not to say that Israel isn&#39;t an enormous behind-the-scenes player.  But there are too many righteous Jews who oppose the plutocracy to believe it&#39;s a vast &quot;conspiracy.&quot; </p>

<p>Yes the Jewish/Roma/Homosexual/et al holocaust of WW2 occurred.  So have innumerable others throughout human history. Frankly, I&#39;m pretty sick of hearing about it as an excuse for in-kind atrocities.</p>

<p>Extraterrestrial aliens.  No.  But there are indeed &quot;UFO&#39;s&quot; inasmuch as experimental aircraft (without public identification) ply our skies.  Once they are identified--which they are-- they are no longer &quot;unidentified.&quot; There are no Roswellian bodies stored in subterranean laboratories.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of JFK? If the answer is no, then who else do you believe was involved?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haven&#39;t done enough research into this to render an informed answer, sorry, no answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on what you know, who carried out the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11? Do you see any reason to question the official version of events that day?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Al Qaeda operatives. It is plausible that the idea was planted with AQ by agents of the US and plausible that at least some of it could have been funded by agents of the US and seems almost certain that at least some of the &quot;intelligence failures&quot; were purposeful.</p>

<p>Reference: Pearl Harbor</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever heard of the Illuminati? Do you believe that such an organization exists and if so what do you believe its agenda to be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Yes. Increasing its own power &amp; influence / the power &amp; influence of its members</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe the Holocaust really occurred? If not, why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe the government is harboring evidence for the proving of the existence of aliens (or harboring the aliens themselves?) What evidence do you believe proves this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First part maybe. It&#39;s tough to say what items they might have, had an alien craft suffered a catastrophic malfunction while visiting.</p>

<p>Second part, probably not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s rather a long chain of logic that I use to draw the conclusion, but if aliens are here, they are here to watch, influence, or both. If influence is part of it, the influence would be for us to mature as a species. Become less warlike. Less barbaric. Less evil.</p>

<p>But we&#39;re going the opposite direction, and it&#39;s coming top-down.</p>

<p>If they&#39;re just here observing, nobody&#39;s going to know. Any society technically advanced enough to get here is surely technically advanced enough to ensure we don&#39;t know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) no. Oswald was CIA, framed then assassinated. The CIA killed Kennedy. And I guarantee there&#39;s high-def footage to prove it. </p>

<p>1 again) 9/11 was a pre-meditated false flag. Drone driven planes, a missile hit the Pentagon, and the towers were rigged to collapse. It was a ritualistic black mass to indicate the collapse of Western power. </p>

<p>2) the illuminati are luciferians. Wikipedia that for more info. They believe they are doing &quot;enlightening&quot; work, when they&#39;re really egotists playing God.</p>

<p>3) yes a holocaust occurred, burnt offerings were made, but because they didn&#39;t occur in the Temple, they were not sacrifices to Yahweh. </p>

<p>4) Aliens are bullshit. ET life would be too advanced for the government to suppress. I do however believe that ancient civilizations had discovered free energy before, collapsed and whose history was suppressed from our modern understanding. </p>

<li><p>I don&#39;t think he acted alone, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever know the truth. There are several competing conspiracy theories that are convincing in their own ways. I think this is the real cover up. To let people debate what happened without any real answers ever getting uncovered. </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m starting to come around to the idea that the planes were hijacked but then remotely controlled by drones. Controlled by who? I have no idea. I don&#39;t care about the who as much as the how. Several holes in the story but I think WTC 7&#39;s collapse was accurately explained and that this is a more fine tuned example of &quot;poisoning the well&quot; of conspiracy theorists. There was no &quot;autopsy&quot; done of WTC wreckage. Nobody checked for explosives or anything like that. Same cleanup method employed in Russia after the Russian Apartment Bombings. I think Flight 93 was shot down during the passenger&#39;s struggle with the hijackers</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t believe there is an Illuminati. There is a system being perpetuated, but nobody is in control. Everyone that comes into power or influence is just inheriting something that&#39;s been moving for hundreds of years already with one goal in mind. Get more. It will keep going until it can&#39;t go any more. </p></li>
<li><p>Yes. There&#39;s too much proof of it occurring. The idea that the Holocaust was faked is laughable in my opinion. That said, I have absolutely no problem in making sure the numbers and figures we have are accurate. What&#39;s the point in keeping inaccurate records of history? </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m not sure about this one. I&#39;d love to say yes, but it just seems so odd that as more and more people get cell phones with high def cameras that we&#39;re seeing less and less UFO videos. </p></li>

<li><p>Absolutely not. It was a pre-planned event, carried out by the CIA, headed by Bush, as retaliation for JFK attempting to get rid of the dollar. </p></li>
<li><p>Who carried it out is irrelevant in my opinion. The goal of 9/11 was to restrict American&#39;s freedoms via the Patriot Act and at the same time, drum up support for an invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan for economic reasons. See Operation Northwoods. (I think Operation Northwoods fits 9/11 pretty well, just replace Cuba with Iraq and Afghanistan.)</p></li>
<li><p>Yes and perhaps. It&#39;s certainly not the same Bavarian Order of the Illuminati from 1776 but I think it&#39;s possible that a few amounts of Illumists kept the ideas of the original order and combined their ideologies with other secret societies such as Freemasonry, Knights Templar, Rosecrucians Skull &amp; Bones, Scroll &amp; Key, etc. Their goal:  infiltrate positions of power to implement a one world government police state.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a hard one. I&#39;m not sure about this but I certainly don&#39;t believe 6 million Jews died during 1938-1945 due to the 6 million figure being used before World War 2. </p></li>
<li><p>No idea on this one. </p></li>
