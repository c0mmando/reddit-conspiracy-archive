       My conclusion is cognitive dissonance, whether consciously or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turning their entire knowledge and beliefs upside down is difficult to accept mentally. It is much easier to brush it off as "nonsense" than to accept the remote
       <em>
        possibility
       </em>
       of something being vastly different than what they have been told.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we had good, hard, irrefutable proof of some of these nefarious conspiracies... I don't think too many would be able to accept it and change their minds. They would find some justification for it and go on with life as usual. See the whole torture issue going on right now, "well it was terrible.. but I mean.. 9/11 was too..." Even when you point out the awful things like
       <strong>
        mothers being forced to watch their own children being sodomized by US operatives
       </strong>
       , they just shrug it off as "well.. mistakes were made.. people were under a lot of tension..." It goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be honest... many of us here have been on "information and research binges" that have left us feeling rather... lost, confused, angry, or shocked. Lots of people are not ready for that moment yet, some never will.

       This is pretty much it. There has to be some type of link between us that makes this information easier for us to swallow but I don't know what it is. A study could find the answer but who's going to spend time studying that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I at least have hope that in 20 years things will be different because far fewer people watch the news and buy into propaganda. Even if it is a kid playing video games that doesn't care about what goes on in the world. That's one less person fighting for the wrong cause.

       it doesnt matter if even a vast majority dont watch the propoganda if they are atomized, 1984 is clear about this, the inner party is who the propoganda is for , the proles arent a threat because they dont have the capacity to organize a resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       that is why privacy cant be allowed in the united states because they need to know immediately if anyone is even thinking aboit forming an organized resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       1984 will tell one more about our world than gje new york times, the only thing that needs to be updated is that the usa is airstrip one for israel and other bankers, and so is the uk.

       That is right. I once told a. Friend of mine (he is educates and all) what I think about the world as we know it, that there is corporate greed and that we live in a police state. He of course said that is not right. Well, I gave him enough facts to proof myself right.

       What I saw then was my friend staring into nothing for like 5 minutes. He knew I was right but you could clearly see that his brain was not ready to accept it.

       They connect their personal sense of self, personal identity, feelings about themselves(self-worth, self-empowerment, self-esteem, etc) around the bullshit that you're trying to tell them is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you prove to them their beliefs are bullshit, they lose a belief they hold that currently is making them feel good about themselves, and suddenly they would have to deal with self/life/the world differently - that's hard for people. It's also why religion has such sway over people - it's about beliefs that are attached to people's feelings about themselves and life/the world/their place in it - if you "present them facts" that would dispel a belief that makes them feel good about themselves that they've based their identity around, it doesn't matter how true those facts are, they'll ignore them and reflect back to you the negative feelings you're giving them about themselves by making them FACE those facts, which they do in place of processing those negative feelings, associated with those facts, which disprove their ideas, opinions, or belief systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's personal, to sum it up, they are personally invested in the propaganda they grew up believing in, you trying to 'tell them the truth' is akin to you attacking them/who they are personally, as far as how it makes them feel - so they don't want to hear it because they aren't strong or smart enough to deal with it.

       Some people(like conspiracy theorists) have the sense of self being derived from the filter through which all of their views have to go, that being "whatever is actually true based on their highest form of reasoning / honest thinking", which is how they are able to accept views that would otherwise be
       <em>
        dis
       </em>
       empowering and would
       <em>
        decrease
       </em>
       their sense of self-esteem as derived through their views(like, for example, instead of "I'm part of the greatest society on Earth and I'm an integral part of it and I could become president or choose the president", they have to accept that that nice belief isn't true at all, and in reality they're being tricked by criminals who know how to lie to people and they have been tricked since they were little kids when they first started understanding language).

       You're being petty and trying to feel good about yourself through me and what I said in a petty, shallow, dishonest way - this is a good example of what I'm about to explain for you. Everyone wants to be able to feel good about themselves, feel smart, feel personally empowered, etc. - people who aren't conspiracy theorists do this with their belief in the official social narrative of the country and culture they were born into, for example in Nazi Germany(or an alternative example would be Saudi Arabia or any other Muslim fundamentalist country in the modern world), the average person derived their sense of personal identity from their involvement in the Nazi Party and their belief in, as I said, the
       <em>
        official social narrative
       </em>
       - and their inclusion in it was central to their sense of self-worth and personal identity, as that is what they derive their identity from(bullshit cultural BELIEFS that would
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       to be "empowering" and "intelligent" - but really aren't) - the "conspiracy theorists" gets to 'feel good about himself' and have an identity from recognizing that they "really aren't" and trying to help the other people NOT believe in the cultural narrative and propaganda of places like Nazi Germany(but person A tries to call person B mentally ill, or call them liars, or whatever is necessary for person A to keep believing in the bullshit lies they use to make themselves feel good about themselves, while person B suggests the truth - that they are believing in and deriving their personal identity from harmful, bullshit lies/propaganda).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas the "conspiracy theorist" of Nazi Germany was smart enough on their own to realize that they
       <em>
        couldn't
       </em>
       derive their personal identity through
       <em>
        that obvious propaganda and social bullshit
       </em>
       , and so instead derived their personal-identity and 'ability to feel good/intelligent/empowered/etc.' through their own intellectual principles which empowered them to filter the truth from the belief and which gave them the necessary courage to
       <em>
        resist it
       </em>
       , and by
       <em>
        recognizing how fucking dishonest and retarded everything going on in their society was
       </em>
       , whereas when these people tried to inform the other, "normal" people of what was really going on in their society, that would have made the "normal people" feel stupid to admit to or recognize it, as they were deriving their sense of self/self-empowerment/etc. from their belief &amp; participation in the Nazi Germany "official social narratives"(state propaganda) -- rather than from their
       <em>
        actual self
       </em>
       , from inside, internally, with their own discernment. People who don't have or use their own discernment obviously will not have their own sense of self-identity without someone giving it to them(like the leaders of their society or culture), people who
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have their own discernment and use it
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       have their own sense of self-identity without believing whatever is given to them in their culture's 'authorized' social narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand the difference between the two? One is a person using a belief system to make themselves feel good about themselves, the other is based on people using reality to feel good about themselves by being strong/smart enough to see things for what they are - rather than trying to see everything in whatever way will make them feel 'most empowered' or 'most connected' or 'most involved'. One is a belief system which lend someone a sense of self, the other is a set of principles(eg self-honesty) which give a person their sense of self. I have given you a very clear and simple, honest explanation of it, the
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       same thing can be applies to the US and the societies of the modern world, and "the people who believe in the official social narrative/derive their sense of self and sense of self-esteem/self-empowerment/etc. through them and their bullshit propaganda" vs. "the people who derive those things from logical observations
       <em>
        about those beliefs
       </em>
       that the average person has".
      </p>
      <p>
       One kind of person is deriving their sense of self through shallow, dishonest bullshit lies(type A), one kind of person is deriving their sense of self through principles which enable them to develop a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       sense of self which is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       dependent on their social
       <em>
        beliefs
       </em>
       , because the principles on which they function don't lend themselves to "beliefs", they lend themselves to "seeing whatever is actually true in a given topic or issue"(type B). Type A is using their belief systems to feel good about themselves, type B is using their principles to discern truth in the beliefs being pushed on them by others, and therefor gains their sense of self-identity in a more grounded and honest way, by honestly accepting the world as it is, rather than becoming personally invested in whatever the most recent piece of self-empowering propaganda is, which Type A believes in. I'm assuming you're type A, and I'm type B - and you are here trying to make yourself feel good about yourself through me/bolster your own belief systems and sense of self by trying to make yourself feel smarter than someone who is being smarter than you are(simply based on the way I function - you could be the way too).
      </p>
      <p>
       DO YA UNDERSTAND? For
       <em>
        example
       </em>
       - you derive your sense of self from believing in George Bush's bullshit and you make yourself feel "empowered" by thinking "yeah you're gonna go get those fuckin muslims", and you feel good about yourself by "supporting the official social narrative as given to you by your betters" - this leads to your death and the creation of millions of new enemies for us all in wars which will turn out to
       <em>
        be based on admitted lies
       </em>
       -- where
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       derive my sense of self through the honest interpretation of George Bush's bullshit, and I make myself feel "empowered" by
       <em>
        seeing it for what it actually is
       </em>
       and admitting to myself whatever the truth is, rather than being unwilling to do that because it would ostracize me from the normal culture full of people who aren't doing this, and who instead are just going along with whatever is passed down to them through their televisions. One of these things is a belief system, the other is based on actual personal principles(which are conducive to an
       <em>
        actual, independent
       </em>
       sense of self and personal identity), rather than one derived from participation/cooperation with/consent to bullshit lies/beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Type A can't mix with Type B, because Type A is being stupid, but making themselves
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       smart by including themselves in a cultural norm, Type A is being disempowered by letting their minds be warped and their actions be influenced by beliefs based on bullshit - Type B isn't - so Type A would be
       <em>
        made to feel bad about themselves and their beliefs
       </em>
       simply by Type B existing, so they
       <strong>
        must ostracize them
       </strong>
       , ignore them, and attack them, rather than considering what they are saying - maybe you do that too, that, or they try desperately to prove to themselves that "really, they're smarter than Type B", because everything about Type A is them desperately seeking to feel good about themselves in artificial/dishonest ways, because that's just what they do, but that precludes any real involvement in real discussion or debate with a Type B. Is that what you're doing here, bud? Now that I've answered you'll refuse to participate honestly or pretend like there's no separation between Type A and Type B?
      </p>
      <p>
       Type A and B are different because Type A believes in and derives their identity through
       <em>
        belief systems
       </em>
       , Type B thinks based on rational/skeptical principles about the mass-beliefs that Type A believes in and derives their identity from, Type B derives their identity from NOT 'just believing' things that are actually stupid, bullshit lies. It's
       <strong>
        exactly the same as
       </strong>
       religions vs the non-religious, that's exactly what cultural beliefs are as well.

       Completely and utterly wrong. I would quite happily put a bullet into the guy's head if it would change anything, except he's already done the damage.

       I also have no particular interest in Muslims, Jews, Israel or anyone else in the Middle-East. They could all live for thousand years or be turned into a sheet of glass and it wouldn't affect me personally.

      <p>
       You also suffer from a common form of thinking here - the "black or white" view. Either someone is a car-carrying truthseeker or they spend their time watching Honey fucking Boo-Boo. What a disservice you pay your fellow men.

       If you see me comment on something, it's because it's a poor argument. If someone has a strong evidential-based argument that is decent, you won't see me arguing against it. People here say they're here for the truth. So am I. The trouble is that everyone seems to have their own version of it.

       All it really takes is one good, solid, irrefutable detail to shatter the entire narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the obvious controlled demolition of WTC7 should be one of those details that anyone with a functional brain should/would question. Add in the fact that Larry Silverstein
       <em>
        watched
       </em>
       WTC7 collapse (in Silverstein "pull it" video)and you've got yourself an "ah ha" moment.

       They cannot even control their own lives. So they are afraid to take a look behind the curtain. It is a psychological self-defense mechanism. We need to really get that, because those in our lives who do not share the interest in knowledge that is being discussed here are not stupid, as some people here might want you to believe. It is our responsibility, that we remain respectful and kindly guide them towards the gates of greater understanding. We all need to understand, they have to go trough all by themselves.

       Ask if they support the rape and turture of people, at which they cry 'NO!!' as if they're defending the victims. Then question 'why are you allowing a system to remain in place that so evidently facilitates it and covers up the truth? i mean serioulsy have you heard anything about the isle of wight children's home abuse scandal since it first appeared in the news? or the Jimmy Saville connection?'

       Some of it (which nobody has mentioned yet) is the lack of knowledge possessed by the person you're trying to convince. For example, how can you prove something wrong with physics if they don't know any?

       It's because of years and years of propaganda enforced into their psyche.

       Carl jung said that,  "man will do nearly anything, no matter how absurd, to prevent coming face to face with their own soul". 
People do not like to admit or realize they are, or have been wrong. Most people think that because they themselves think something, it must be right. Otherwise, why would they have had the thought in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been indoctrinated into believing they are stupid and powerless.
      </p>

       The best way to help someone wake up is to provide your information with sources. Sources, sources, sources! Most won't believe anything unless it comes from a major news network. 
Also, do not play the fear card.

       I accepted the harsh actuality of the current situation, without taking it for what I wanted it to be, or how it seemed to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically I had to change everything I knew, pretty much. It was like a conscious reset for my brain. It was amazing. Everyone should go through it. The first little while is weird and kinda sad, but you work through it

       Human beings are amazing things. We've been through a lot and have always bounced back. These elite fuckers are not going to hold us down for much longer.

       I'm not sure. 
At the time I was reading a lot of occult knowledge and theory. The conspiracy aspect applied to how I saw the physical world. The occult was everything else, including myself. 
An ego death took place, so to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why this happened to me and not others, again, I cannot say. 
Some people only go into the rabbit hole so far, often timid and fearful of the experience.

        All this was inspired by the principle—which is quite true within itself—that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying.

       Because the evidence is generally lacking in the cases of extreme conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people will accept plausible conspiracy theories, but they won't accept extraordinary ones without extraordinary proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it seems that many conspiracy theories are entirely supported by unrelated factoids generally selected via a process of confirmation bias, with their related significance to each other greatly exaggerated.
      </p>

       But I suspect that's not the answer you wanted to hear.
