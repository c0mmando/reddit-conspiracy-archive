        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been very interested in conspiracies for some time now. Not only because they make sense to me, but because they almost (key word &quot;almost&quot;) never seem to contradict each other. When looking at the world collectively, as a whole, conspiracy theories seem to all intertwine to an extent. </p>

<p>Lately I find myself in an almost constant state of frustration. I assume many of you understand this feeling of frustration and may feel it as well. This feeling is caused by what I would call being outside the flock of sheep. Now I know the term sheep is not something most people are fond of but I use this word for a lack of a better one. I myself used to be what I would call a part of the &quot;flock&quot;. But, like most of you, through extensive research and questioning I found what I would call &quot;the truth&quot; and I am very, very troubled by it. </p>

<p>Yes, we all know how the world is full of evil, egotistical behavior, sociopathic tendencies, horrific events, etcetera. We are to the point of knowing enough. Now that we have acquired such a large amount of information on the problems and corruption in the world, it is time to DO SOMETHING about it. I know me even typing this is hypocritical and probably been said here before. You know as well as I do that you and I alone have little power or influence. But even this subreddit alone has the power to start making an influence and even a change.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I have the solutions to these problems out planet is facing. But I think it&#39;s time we shift our focus away from just talking about the problems. Yes, finding new information and sharing it is important. But what is the point of talking about all the problems unless we are going to try to find a solution. </p>

<p>We are part of a minority. Many of you, like myself, have been ridiculed for your interests in subject matters that could be categorized as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. As the critical thinkers of society, I believe it is our job as well as in our best interest that we work towards a solution. We all probably have ideas on how to fight this battle. We all have different areas of expertise. So why don&#39;t we start working hard to stop corruption and solve problems rather than just talking/complaining about it.</p>

<p>Trust me, I am guilty of complaining about it too. I was in a state of deep depression for a time because of how much the problems of the world weighed on my heart. I see how the world could be and how it currently is, and it makes me sad and frustrated. I apologize if this seems like the typical rant you may hear but I just felt like I needed to share. I hope you share the same vision as I do and are willing to work towards a liberated planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No apologies necessary dude. We&#39;ve all been there (at least those of us still hanging around there).</p>

<p>That depression thing though - that&#39;s a bitch, eh? Took me 6 months to crawl the fuck out, and that demon is still always right around the corner (at least for me).</p>

<p>Good on you for getting out of the rabbit hole alive, regardless of how deep you dove. And good on you for coming up for air with this level of positivity. You&#39;ll gt a few responses here, for sure, but the beat thing you can do is never stop learning at this point.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need a teacher or a professor telling you what to read and what assignments yo post every Friday, although I can do that if you want (it&#39;s my day job).</p>

<p>At this point, it&#39;s up to you to deprogram yourself of all the nationalistic propaganda, all the lies, and figure out *what the fuck you really wanna do on this rock in the next 2 months, 2 years, 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Want change? We all do. Gotta get specific. Pick an injustice. Pick a cause. For now. Maybe it&#39;s local. Maybe it&#39;s political. Environmental? Wanna go the sustainability route? Crazy prepper route? World&#39;s your oyster man. Just don&#39;t stop learning and question <strong>everything</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate the response my friend. I hate to see others enter that same deep depression I was in and still have from time to time. Unfortunately it seems to be a necessary evil. We will find a way to bring about change, one piece at a time. I&#39;m glad to hear you made it out of that depression too man. I know how terrible it is. Like a feeling of hopelessness. Looking for solutions has helped me become happier and more positive in life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Something people generally fail to realize, that we are all one.</p>

<p>Yes.  Many of us do fail to realize this...and TPTB really <em>constantly</em> fan the flames of racial division both covertly and overtly.  It keeps us slaves constantly fighting and bickering amongst each other so that we never bother to look up and realize that we are ALL being manipulated by a small, covert hidden group above us all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The illusion of separation is an important factor and something that must be eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct...and an illusion indeed it is.  Unfortunately, many give it a lot of power still.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yes, while there is still discrimination and pointless conflict, nothing will be accomplished. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is a big part of the reason why TPTB make sure and CONTINUOUSLY fan those flames...constantly...on the MSM you are almost always getting some sort of &quot;black did this to white&quot; and/or &quot;white did this to black&quot;, &quot;cop did this to civilian&quot; or &quot;civilian did this to cop&quot;, &quot;rich did this to poor&quot;, &quot;poor did this to rich&quot;, etc, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really fucking horrible.  And then you get post after post in websites like Reddit where the slaves take those stories and just keep fanning them even more by posting and re-posting and giving more and more energy to all the divisions - further driving each of us apart from one other because we&#39;re &quot;black&quot;, or &quot;white&quot;, or &quot;rich&quot;, or &quot;poor&quot;, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Fucking sick...<em>really</em> stupid and bad, it is.</p>

<p>When are we going to realize that the whole <em>POINT</em> of all this division propaganda b.s. is to continue keeping us unable to come together as the one people that we truly are?  It is this which will always prevent us from having enough power <em>as one</em> to take out ANY sort of manipulation against us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The solutions are already here and at work, you are just in too much of a legitimate hurry that they might be too slow for you to notice. You are not going to reverse millenniums of lies in short order, it will take a while, i personally think it&#39;s happening much faster than i anticipated if it makes you feel better :)</p>

<p>Examples of solution: alternative medias (here, the vineyard...), alternative economies (bitcoins, trade cooperatives....), alternative politics (liquid democracy, sortition, cheatless electronic systems...), alternative science (crowdsourced phenomenon but it has already made discoveries, or rather rediscoveries, like ketogenic metabolism, bioelectronics to control infections...). And so on and so forth, what takes time is to change the part of belief and disbelief in people&#39;s brain, that takes a really long while (or a really big event that costs a lot of money to organize, psyop style...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree. Everyone needs to vent sometimes. Or at least get information or an idea out there. Also this may not be the best place to start, I know.

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. While this change could take place naturally over time, it doesn&#39;t look likely at this point. People are so heavily conditioned to believe certain things and disregard other things. A large portion of society is controlled, misled, and kept in fear/confusion. That is worrisome to me. There is always a solution though. Just not sure what it will be just yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of us are in the same boat as you are, so I understand your frustration completely, trust me. All I can do is really share what I do personally. You and I know that you can try talking to people close minded until you are blue in the face, it gets you no where because the idea of a global conspiracy is a bit too much for some people to handle, or see as an absolute truth. So what I do is network with like minded individuals. I have a ton of contacts I follow on face book that are actively touring with influential open minds, and I have been to a few of these events and met a lot of people and became friends with them. What makes the powers that be so effective at what they do is that they are a collective, and for the most part are unified in their agenda. That&#39;s really what we need to do if we plan on making any kind of changes for the good. They want you depressed, they want you feeling hopeless, don&#39;t give in to that bullshit man. Find more like minded people and together cast some nets out there and bring more people away from the herd. Realistically that&#39;s all you can re do that will produce some results. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly what you mean. I&#39;ve found myself in the past spouting off to family members and friends about things of this nature and their response being frustrating. Some people just don&#39;t care at all. As humans begin to become open to the truth I think others will follow. Either through their own questioning and research of conformity. Not letting these things get you down is definitely a challenge. I&#39;m happy to say I&#39;m out of that depressed and hopeless state. I&#39;ve replaced it with a less narcissistic solution oriented kinda view. Positivity makes all the difference</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 100% that we need solutions. This sub may not be the most fertile soil for planting seeds of change, and then again, maybe it is the perfect sub for such. I believe that finding your true passion in life is a key to unlocking many doors that were once locked. And allowing those interests to evolve and change is another key component. We all grow and change, so should our passions and interests. Sadly most live in a society where the &quot;daily grind&quot; dominates. We work a J.O.B. (just over broke) instead of a career. This spoken word poetry piece explains best what I feel about jobs and expectations in society.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzcxOl4b7IA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzcxOl4b7IA</a></p>

<p>Finding the career that feeds your soul is a must to thrive and not just survive. Figuring out how to share it and inspire others that they too can break free from a matrix of sorts is a huge step forward in (r)evolution. What we do does directly impact others around us and vise versa. We are the company we keep. We are what we eat and so on. My advice is ask yourself what you love to do, find a way to construct a career around that as the foundation, break away from the j.o.b. mentality and share your talents. That is a huge solution to start with. From there many things begin to cosmically fall into place so to say. I believe that the universe wants us to define what we want more than what we don&#39;t want or don&#39;t like. So its all a balancing act. I love this sub because it keeps me in check, on point and allows me to locate that middle ground.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have the right idea. Even if you know what brings you joy and feeds that fire inside, you are well beyond those questioning what makes them happy. My suggestions are to focus on all of the things that bring you joy, self empowerment, community evolvement, and deeper meaningful change. Cultivate them, and then allow the conspiracy mind to reflect on outer questions and reasons after you have built a solid foundation to do so. Just my two cents. I believe change and solutions to problems come from within. After all, we CAN change ourselves. We might only at best influence others. Hang in there. Everything gets better if you believe it can.

    <div class="md"><p>People also don&#39;t realize how fragmented and fractious the general population is.  There&#39;s no such thing as one &quot;the People&quot; who are unified in their thinking against &quot;the Man&quot;.</p>

<p>Perhaps there could be a non-violent change, but many people advocate violent revolution.  They&#39;re crazy:</p>

<p>The aftermath of a successful violent revolt would be hideous. All sorts of groups would take the opportunity to carve out enclaves, steal stuff, kill opponents or perceived enemies. The country would fragment into pieces by religion, race, wealth, region, etc.</p>

<p>No one would agree on what the new government or political structure should be. Everyone would take the opportunity to try to write their favorite position into the Constitution or laws: anti-abortion, anti-gay, anti-GMO, anti-immigrant, anti-fossil-fuel, pro-fossil-fuel, anti-gun, pro-gun, etc.</p>

<p>The economy would tank, the dollar would tank, the world economy would tank. The killing would go on for a long, long time. USA is the most heavily-armed country in the world, civilian, police and military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;same place&quot; they all come from is the conclusion, which is adopted at the start, not derived from the facts.  They all start with govt is evil and/or corps are evil and/or rich people are evil, and then invent or distort facts to fit their conclusion.</p>

<p>I think the real source of them is frustration, and fear, and lashing out against authority.  People are frustrated because their lives aren&#39;t going well, the economy is bad, they don&#39;t have a job or are losing ground.  They fear poverty or failure or losing their possessions.  They react by lashing out at any authority (govt, police, scientists, rich people, corps, whatever).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep focusing on the least important part of my comments.  The important part is &quot;theorists MAKE UP THEIR FACTS&quot;.  And it has been my experience that yes, the overwhelming majority of theorists are coming from an &quot;axe to grind, conclusion to support&quot; position.  That&#39;s why they believe every conspiracy theory they hear about, why new theories come out ten seconds after some new event happens.  There is no wait for facts, no investigation, no thinking.  They just force the (scant) information into shape to fit the conclusion they want and publish the new theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; in common parlance is something with no facts supporting it, something that was invented to try to justify a conclusion.  The official story was formed as a result of weeks and months of investigation by thousands of investigators, in dozens of agencies, inside and outside USA.</p>

<p>The official story was that there was a conspiracy in Al Qaeda to attack USA, and there is lots of evidence that they found before concluding that.  And Bin Laden himself said it was true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They said Bin Laden did it on 9/11.  They didn&#39;t wait months to say that.  Some of the people who called for more investigation were mailed anthrax that was shown to be sourced from US military sources.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the anthrax attacks had anything to do with people calling for more 9/11 investigations.  And that&#39;s a pretty vague and ineffective way to threaten people.  If you want to threaten someone, get some goons to beat them up.  Direct and personal.</p>

<p>Apparently Bin Laden had a long history with US govt before 9/11, threatening attacks, so of course they suspected him on 9/11.  I don&#39;t think they said &quot;he definitely did it&quot; right on 9/11, or even for weeks afterward.

My suggestions are to focus on all of the things that bring you joy, self empowerment, community evolvement, and deeper meaningful change. Cultivate them, and then allow the conspiracy mind to reflect on outer questions and reasons after you have built a solid foundation to do so. Just my two cents. I believe change and solutions to problems come from within. After all, we CAN change ourselves. We might only at best influence others. Hang in there. Everything gets better if you believe it can.
