    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I reached a tipping point long ago. Of course I always played US/Soviet football in gradeschool. I learned to see the great benefit of a cooperative combination of both human sides. As indeed they are human.</p>

<p>I watched as the former Soviet Union fell in a political collapse, and formed flowers of a prosperous and free group of societies. I watched how Russia recovered to new heights of prosperity, while retaining, extending, and enhancing that which was already their best. Venturing into space in marvelously elegant and reliable ways.</p>

<p>I stood beneath the Soyuz on a trip to newly united Russia and I visited every place. I tasted the food and I examined society. I found freedom and dreams and prosperity and an ambition of a righteous people.</p>

<p>I saw the United States turn toward despotism. One in twenty-five of all Americans working for a part of their government, billowing police forces incurring average citizens into monthly police operations. Stopping them to check their train tickets as they depart from a train platform. Stopping them to check their store reciepts at major retailers. Stopping them while protesting and asking for their ID&#39;s. Stopping them while walking and asking to see their ID&#39;s just for literally - holding up a sign at the edge of a public park, which says only &quot;FAIR TAX&quot;.</p>

<p>This tipping point is one which takes a person from their patriotic slant, into a new patriotism which seeks the best for all lifeforms without harm, without violation, but through THE ACTUAL ACTS OF GOOD which are unlike the behavior of the modern US Government.</p>

<p>The acts of uplifting the lives of all people, not as one, but as many. The acts of cooperation between all sides of humanity.</p>

<p>The acts such as: Contributing to the embetterment of foreign societies. Helping people who are forced to live through economic recessions. Being the solution to a problem caused obviosly by our failed leaders. Uplifting the lives of what few people that we can, so that even in the darkest hours of US tyranny. There may be a light amongst the collapse into corporate slavery.</p>

<p>These people who are inately good. These people who have extended the olive branch for us to share, while we have fed our own people the worst in unlabeled science experiments, whereby laboratory processes are necessary for the production of the food, where nutrition disappears in an abyss of fat, starches and globulous compounds. Our milk which is like white oil, and completely unlike that rich creme which I found from Russian cows. That taste of wonderful protein. Those stores with natural meat, cheese, milk, bread, crackers, and sausage. Products which are beyond comparison to US processed-junk-food markets.</p>

<p>I realized that there is a simultaneous good and a bad in every single country, people, and... potentially everything. That we could embrace the good in all societies and combine them together through cooperation. A common purpose. A shared kindness. That if only our government did not so punish its own whistle-blowers, defectors, book-writers, reporter-leakers, or political dissidents, that our government could see that there is a third way.</p>

<p>However I saw the US Government&#39;s beligerency. I saw its aggression against its own people, arrested under laws of simply living. And there was one after the other to leave the US Government and write books, to give speeches, to literally stand up with their backs tuned in silent protest and be forcibly removed from high-level speeches. To release stories. I watched as the US Government&#39;s only response was to punish those people who acted for the best condition of their own society.</p>

<p>And I realized we can not be silent anymore. That we simply must recognize the fact that places once behind us, are beating us. That we have taken a step back as a nation, and that no matter how delusional our government is in its presumed greatness, that there is a very real metric of reality which is judging our country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I reached my tipping point a long time ago... but let me say this:  I was watching the State of the Union the other night, and I realized how bad shit is getting.. when Obama was walking out greeting everyone I felt like I was watching a WWE wrestling event... It is all fakery and theatrics and it&#39;s gonna be that way until the collapse.. which is probably not too far off...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious what the tipping point for sites like reddit will be. Subreddits like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> are becoming increasingly disconnected from reality(<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> has been in la-la land for a while now.)</p>

<p>A lot of it is astroturfing, but astroturfing has to be done with a delicate touch. If people become aware of it, then suddenly everyone spouting your opinion will be under suspicion and become less credible. I think we may be reaching that tipping point in some of the major subreddits because we have some comment threads that are fiercely anti-establishment and others that are suspiciously pro-establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t actually sat down and purposely watched the news on a regular day in who knows how long. Sure i watched on 9/11 and The Boston bombings. But other than that, it disgusts me. </p>

<p>I cant really say i agree that the same &quot;tipping point&quot; rules apply to sites like Reddit. I&#39;ve never been on those Subreddits. But when it comes to mainstream media, its easy to look at CNN or FOX and be fed-up with their bullshit as a whole, they are looked at as a single entity. CNN or FOX are just one big biased opinion with a solid agenda, who get payed to be so. </p>

<p>The same cant really be said about Reddit due to its millions of different users who create all the content. With no agenda. For free. Its a little different. It&#39;s hard to say with worldnews or politics because there are always going to be a side A and side B voicing why their opinion is the correct one. Those are just the kind of discussions that topic permits. </p>

<p>Astroturfing is a completely different story</p>

<p>You still think Reddit lets real users have a significant voice? The only content that gets seen is what they allow. It wasn&#39;t just Aaron Swartz that died that day.</p>
