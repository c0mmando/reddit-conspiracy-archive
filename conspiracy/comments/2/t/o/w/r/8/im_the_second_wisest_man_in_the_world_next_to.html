<p>You mean the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite? That would actually make sense (if that is who you are referring to), as they are one of the countless known heirs to Templar tradition. </p>

<p>Fun fact: Buzz Aldrin, being a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemason, had taken a Masonic banner <a href="http://gnosticwarrior.com/33rd-degree-mason-buzz-aldrin.html">to the moon</a>, and left it here purportedly.</p>

<p>Another fun fact: There exists a rite of Freemasonry, unknown to most Masons, that incorporates the 33 degrees of the Scottish Rite while containing an additional 66, for a total of 99 degrees, the highest of which being the deeply esoteric/hermetic degrees contained in the <em>Arcana Arcanorum</em>, acquired by the Count Cagliostro in the 18th century. It it known as the A.PR.M.M. or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_Memphis-Misraim">Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Misraim</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly, the androgyne goat of Mendes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is in nature one most potent force, by means whereof single man, who could 
possess himself of it, and should know how to direct it, could revolutionize and 
change the face of the world. </p>

<p>This force was known to the ancients. It is a universal age whose supreme law is 
<em>equilibrium</em>; and whereby, if science can but learn how to control it, it will be 
possible to change the order of the Seasons, to produce in night the phenomena of 
day, to send a thought in an instant round the world, to heal or slay at a distance, to 
give our words universal success, a make them reverberate everywhere. </p>

<p>This agent, partially revealed by the blind guesses of the disciples of Mesmer, is 
precisely what the Adepts of the middle ages called the elementary matter of the 
great work. The <em>Gnostics</em> held that it composed the igneous body of the Holy Spirit; 
a it was adored in the secret rites of the Sabbator the Temple, under the 
hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the hermaphrodic goat of Mendes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- <em>Morals &amp; Dogma Of The Ancient And Accepted Scottish Rite Freemasonry</em> by Albert Pike</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, there exists in nature a force which is immeasurably more powerful than steam, and by means of which a single man, who knows how to adapt and direct it, might upset and alter the face of the world. This force was known to the ancients; it consists in a universal agent having equilibrium for its supreme law, while its direction is concerned immediately with the great arcanum of transcendental magic... This agent...is precisely that which the adepts of the middle ages denominated the first matter of the <em>Great Work</em>. The <em>Gnostics</em> represented it as the fiery body of the Holy Spirit; it was the object of adoration in the secret rites of the Sabbath and the Temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the Androgyne of Mendes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- <em>Transcendental Magic, Its Doctrine and Ritual</em> by Eliphas Levi</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>The Devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers to imply a Unity 
in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who had unity would be a God.. &#39;The Devil&#39; is,
 historically, the God of any people that one personally dislikes.. </p>

<p>This serpent, SATAN, is not 
the enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing Good and Evil; He bade &#39;Know Thyself!&#39; and taught Initiation. He is &#39;The Devil&#39; of the Book of Thoth, and His emblem is BAPHOMET, the 
Androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane perfection.. </p>

<p>He is therefore Life, and Love. But 
moreover his letter is ayin, the Eye, so that he is Light; and his Zodiacal image is Capricornus,
 that leaping goat whose attribute is Liberty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- <em>Magick: Liber ABA (Book 4</em>) by Aleister Crowley / To Mega Therion / The Great Beast / 666</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 18th century, speculative theories arose that sought to tie the Knights Templar with the origins of Freemasonry. Bookseller, Freemason and Illuminist Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (1733–1811), in Versuch über die Beschuldigungen welche dem Tempelherrenorden gemacht worden, und über dessen Geheimniß (1782), was the first to claim that the Templars were <em>Gnostics</em>, and that &quot;Baphomet&quot; was formed from the Greek words βαφη μητȢς, baphe metous, to mean Taufe der Weisheit, &quot;Baptism of Wisdom&quot;. Nicolai &quot;attached to it the idea of the image of the supreme God, in the state of quietude attributed to him by the Manichaean Gnostics&quot;, according to F. J. M. Raynouard, and &quot;supposed that the Templars had a secret doctrine and initiations of several grades&quot; which &quot;the Saracens had communicated ... to them.&quot;He further connected the figura Baffometi with the pentagram of Pythagoras:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What properly was the sign of the Baffomet, &#39;figura Baffometi,&#39; which was depicted on the breast of the bust representing the Creator, cannot be exactly determined ... I believe it to have been the Pythagorean pentagon (Fünfeck) of health and prosperity: ... It is well known how holy this figure was considered, and that the Gnostics had much in common with the Pythagoreans. From the prayers which the soul shall recite, according to the diagram of the Ophite-worshippers, when they on their return to God are stopped by the Archons, and their purity has to be examined, it appears that these serpent-worshippers believed they must produce a token that they had been clean on earth. I believe that this token was also the holy pentagon, the sign of their initiation (τελειας βαφης μετεος).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s the very reason he loses quite a bit of credibility for me.  Since there IS so much we don&#39;t know, anyone who claims to have things figured out proves little more than that they DON&#39;T really have things figured out at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Multiple personality disorder is supposedly the result of having more than one soul inhabiting the same avatar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That or having more than one <em>identity</em> inhabiting it - which is not necessarily the same as having more than one soul.  Even if there is more than one soul, however, those souls themselves might be in conflict or confused, so someone who has multiple personality disorder <em>because</em> they have more than one soul competing for physical expression doesn&#39;t at all necessarily mean that the physical individual themselves is, therefore, more gifted or intelligent than one <em>without</em> those multiple personalities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So him being a schizo doesn&#39;t immediately scare me off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t scare me off even a little bit.  That&#39;s not the point though.  It&#39;s not about whether a mpd person &quot;scares&quot; one off.  It&#39;s about the fact that claiming to be &quot;the wisest man&quot; is a direct indication that one is definitely <em>not</em> that...and likely having mpd seems to be further indication that OP is not balanced.  Therefore, your claiming that OP might actually be on to something doesn&#39;t seem to be very well-founded thus far.  I&#39;m willing to entertain the possibility, but I&#39;ve seen zero evidence in his favor thus far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am just wondering if he has some useful information or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Everyone</em> has useful information in principle.  Even if we&#39;re arguing w/one another, there&#39;s a usefulness in that experience that can be used to further one&#39;s development and progression as an identity toward The One.  So yes.  I&#39;m sure he has <em>some</em> useful information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think MPD adds credibility. I am just saying, that MPD doesn&#39;t necessarily discredit him. One of these personalities might be intelligent.</p>

<p>The reason why I was willing to give him some credit was because he seems to know about Hebrew. Original texts (like the bible in such) in their original language (Hebrew and Aramaic) contain a lot of profound information. I thought he understood this and perhaps discovered something that I have yet to.</p>

<p>He also seems to understand that language is just labels for ideas. Inadequate labels that only serve to limit the meaning of ideas. It is a form of control/slavery. When our creator created us, I do not believe he created language. We communicated directly (telepathically) with no language to limit us.</p>

<p>Because he seems to understand some of these ideas, which are more complex than what many people can grasp, I thought maybe he was on to something.</p>

<p>This timecube thing has always confused me. The way I feel about it now, is how I used to feel about people blabbering about aliens. I thought they were basically retarded. Now I see the error in my judgement, and I am trying not to make the same mistake again. But I can&#39;t make heads or tails of timecube, and I can&#39;t find anyone intelligent enough to explain it to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>MPD doesn&#39;t necessarily discredit him.</p>

<p>Not necessarily.  No.  This is correct.  There are many different reasons for MPs, and sometimes...it&#39;s actually <em>not</em> a &quot;disorder&quot; in the clinical sense of the term.  Some people w/MPs are actually <em>more advanced</em> than average, but this world is pretty dark, ignorant, and backward, so most here don&#39;t understand some of the benefits and talents that some &quot;different&quot; personality types might have, so they look at those with MPs as &quot;less than&quot;...not realizing that some of these &quot;different&quot; types might actually be &quot;different&quot; in that they&#39;re actually smarter or more advanced than the average person.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.">John Forbes Nash, Jr.</a> is a good example, but there are many, many others not as famously known.</p>

<p>In the case of OP, however, although he might have MPs, the fact that - again - he claims to be &quot;the wisest&quot; is indication that - regardless of whether he has MPs or <em>not</em> - he <em>doesn&#39;t</em> actually have a very good grasp of things.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the main crux behind my thinking he doesn&#39;t know much of what he&#39;s talking about.  The MP issue was just extra.  The main issue is his hubris.  <em>That&#39;s</em> the problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought he understood this and perhaps discovered something that I have yet to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading through his responses, however, he doesn&#39;t seem to be very aware of many things of this nature, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When our creator created us, I do not believe he created language. We communicated directly (telepathically) with no language to limit us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends which &quot;creator&quot; you mean.  If you mean the limited, physical creator, then that isn&#39;t really the real creator at all.  I don&#39;t know whether we communicated telepathically or not, but I wouldn&#39;t doubt that we had a lot better ability to do that in other times past than we have now.  If you mean the Real Creator, however, then that Creator simply <em>is</em>.  We already ARE that Creator.  It&#39;s just a question of developing sufficiently to realize, understand, and imbue that eternal beingness.</p>

<p>All that being said, even telepathic communication has its limitations.  It is ultimately freer than verbal communication, to be sure, but it is not <em>the</em> freest form of communication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly, the androgyne goat of Mendes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is in nature one most potent force, by means whereof single man, who could 
possess himself of it, and should know how to direct it, could revolutionize and 
change the face of the world. </p>

<p>This force was known to the ancients. It is a universal age whose supreme law is 
<em>equilibrium</em>; and whereby, if science can but learn how to control it, it will be 
possible to change the order of the Seasons, to produce in night the phenomena of 
day, to send a thought in an instant round the world, to heal or slay at a distance, to 
give our words universal success, a make them reverberate everywhere. </p>

<p>This agent, partially revealed by the blind guesses of the disciples of Mesmer, is 
precisely what the Adepts of the middle ages called the elementary matter of the 
great work. The <em>Gnostics</em> held that it composed the igneous body of the Holy Spirit; 
a it was adored in the secret rites of the Sabbator the Temple, under the 
hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the hermaphrodic goat of Mendes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, there exists in nature a force which is immeasurably more powerful than steam, and by means of which a single man, who knows how to adapt and direct it, might upset and alter the face of the world. This force was known to the ancients; it consists in a universal agent having equilibrium for its supreme law, while its direction is concerned immediately with the great arcanum of transcendental magic... This agent...is precisely that which the adepts of the middle ages denominated the first matter of the <em>Great Work</em>. The <em>Gnostics</em> represented it as the fiery body of the Holy Spirit; it was the object of adoration in the secret rites of the Sabbath and the Temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the Androgyne of Mendes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- <em>Transcendental Magic, Its Doctrine and Ritual</em> by Eliphas Levi</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers to imply a Unity 
in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who had unity would be a God.. &#39;The Devil&#39; is,
 historically, the God of any people that one personally dislikes.. </p>

<p>This serpent, SATAN, is not 
the enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing Good and Evil; He bade &#39;Know Thyself!&#39; and taught Initiation. He is &#39;The Devil&#39; of the Book of Thoth, and His emblem is BAPHOMET, the 
Androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane perfection.. </p>

<p>He is therefore Life, and Love. But 
moreover his letter is ayin, the Eye, so that he is Light; and his Zodiacal image is Capricornus,
 that leaping goat whose attribute is Liberty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 18th century, speculative theories arose that sought to tie the Knights Templar with the origins of Freemasonry. Bookseller, Freemason and Illuminist Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (1733–1811), in Versuch über die Beschuldigungen welche dem Tempelherrenorden gemacht worden, und über dessen Geheimniß (1782), was the first to claim that the Templars were <em>Gnostics</em>, and that &quot;Baphomet&quot; was formed from the Greek words βαφη μητȢς, baphe metous, to mean Taufe der Weisheit, &quot;Baptism of Wisdom&quot;. Nicolai &quot;attached to it the idea of the image of the supreme God, in the state of quietude attributed to him by the Manichaean Gnostics&quot;, according to F. J. M. Raynouard, and &quot;supposed that the Templars had a secret doctrine and initiations of several grades&quot; which &quot;the Saracens had communicated ... to them.&quot;He further connected the figura Baffometi with the pentagram of Pythagoras:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What properly was the sign of the Baffomet, &#39;figura Baffometi,&#39; which was depicted on the breast of the bust representing the Creator, cannot be exactly determined ... I believe it to have been the Pythagorean pentagon (Fünfeck) of health and prosperity: ... It is well known how holy this figure was considered, and that the Gnostics had much in common with the Pythagoreans. From the prayers which the soul shall recite, according to the diagram of the Ophite-worshippers, when they on their return to God are stopped by the Archons, and their purity has to be examined, it appears that these serpent-worshippers believed they must produce a token that they had been clean on earth. I believe that this token was also the holy pentagon, the sign of their initiation (τελειας βαφης μετεος).</p>
