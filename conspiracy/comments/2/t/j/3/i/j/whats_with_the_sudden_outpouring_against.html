       Measles outbreak at Disney.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is the rabid propaganda being pushed out is to hide the fact that the vaccine isn't as effective as advertised. Vaccinated people are contracting and spreading measles (and whooping cough, too, the DTAP has the same issue; although a lot of "whooping cough" diagnosis I bet are actually parapertussis, which apparently can have a party when you're immunized for pertussis; but it's supposed to be a lot milder than pertussis itself) - but if we put all of our energy into hating that 1-3% of the population that are actually really anti-vaccination, we take the heat off those poor, poor pharmaceutical companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, poor Merck! They work so hard, yet they're being sued for lying about the efficacy of their MMR vaccine. I mean, is it really their fault that because they lied, the government couldn't justify spending money on other research for better, more effective MMR vaccines? Is it their fault that we're having outbreaks because the vaccines we are using are not as effective as purported?

       </a>
       No way! Absolutely not! It's totally the fault of that 1-3% of parents who didn't vaccinate their kids against Measles. Burn the witches.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a pretty good overview of the issue the pharmabots are trying to hide under cover of worried parents:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They should be ashamed of themselves and people falling for the propaganda and engaging in nastiness about it should really take a few minutes to think long and hard about the entire thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a complex problem, but as with many complex problems, if we can't talk about it like reasonable adults, how do we expect to fix it?

       Yeah,  if much rather take an acellular dtap vaccine with a lower efficacy and shorter lifecycle. But that is the reasoning for the higher rates of whooping cough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Measles outbreaks are cyclical and there's been a big one in Indonesia,  so having some small measles outbreaks in the US (especially california) isn't a surprise. But who cares?  Measles isn't going to be killing people in the US. It's not a big deal.

       Any excuse to push vaccination.  The goal is to make flu vaccines mandatory,  so any way you can push the vaccine meme,  You're going to see it.

       They don't deserve to sell flu shots after this year...the shot they were selling at our local Walgreens had the SAME formulation as last year (no duh that it's not going to match this year's strains, guys), plus, they had no single-dose (non-thimerosal) available. Then, the CDC recommends Tamiflu/Relenza, which you really gotta wonder about. It's banned in a bunch of countries and studies have shown at MAX it lessens symptoms by
       <del>
        a day
       </del>
       half a day...and worst case, your kid jumps off the roof of the house. Ugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't do flu shots anymore after doing a lot of research on them (I might reconsider if they ever release that universal flu shot based on swine flu antibodies that's been 5 years out for 5 years now), but have family members that do. I just ask them to promise me to ask about the single-dose and to check the formulation - the more people that do, the more demand there is for a better product (maybe that's the push behind mandatory vaccines? too many consumers demanding better product this year?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, we don't really need to do the dead shots anymore if they're giving the kids live vaccine. We get dosed without consent. I catch the creeping nose crud every year from them because the school systems
       <em>
        insist
       </em>
       on doing FluMist right before Thanksgiving and Christmas (right when kids are most likely to be in close quarters with elderly relatives, woohoo), knowing full well that they can shed virus for over 20 days. Having a low body temp sucks when you are exposed to kids who are given FluMist...sucks even more for the elderly and immunocompromised. :( What I don't get is why the formulations for the super-old-people shot and FluMist are often different - shouldn't they be the same to avoid the elderly getting a different variant from FluMist? While yeah, it's "cold-attenuated," all bets tend to be off among the immunocompromised and low-body temp crowd.

       But the Disney Land outbreak was linked to individuals who were not vaccinated. So ya, it kind of is the fault of people who don't get vaccinated. Also the first dose of the MMR vaccine is more than 95% effective and there's a second dose that increases that effectiveness even more. Saying the vaccine is not effective enough is simply not true. It's also a terrible line of reasoning so think that you shouldn't vaccinate your children because it isn't 100% effective. The vaccine is far better than nothing.

       They are being sued by multiple parties who are alleging that the 95% effectiveness rate is a lie:

      </p>
      <p>
       They can't come out and say anything about it right now as it's an active case and the DoJ is paying attention. They are a corporation, they can't come forward with "our bad" during active litigation. Shareholders would flip and would probably start suing execs, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Disneyland measles cases are among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. They haven't identified a "patient zero" yet. Either way, it wouldn't matter if they were or were not vaccinated - the speed of spread across both populations is a huge issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I didn't say anything about not vaccinating your children - people should educate themselves and talk to their doctor and make an informed decision about the vaccines they decide to take or avoid based on their personal risk factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I DID SAY is that this idiotic pile-on on Reddit against a tiny minority of people (1-3% across the country) is stupid and counter-productive. If the circlejerkers here really cared, they'd be spreading far and wide for people to ensure they get another MMR and/or to get their immunity checked and verified, not just stupidly screaming "vax or die! vax or die! science, bitches!" Besides, you think Americans are the only ones at DisneyLand?

       Overall, 82% of those infected in this outbreak were not vaccinated, either because they're too young or because they elected not to be, officials said.

       If 82% of 59 people were either unvaccinated by choice or too young then before you use that statistic for a point we need to know how many were too young and how many were unvaccinated by choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypothetically, if it was 50/50, then out of 82% of 59 people, 41% were too young and caught it (about 24 people), 41% chose not to vaccinate and caught it (about 24 people) and 18% were vaccinated and caught it (about 11 people).
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the amount of hoohaa over getting vaccines isn't warranted based off the numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Percentages are a great marketing tool for making things sound bigger or scarier. 82% of 59 people is such a tiny portion of the overall Disneyland visitors and if we don't even know what percentage of that percentage people were unable to be vaccinated, then the percentage and statistic is bullshit.

       Of the 34 California measles victims whose vaccination history could be ascertained, 28 had not received the measles shot.

       While the disease may have originated from outside the U.S. the majority of those infected were not vaccinated. If they had been, the outbreak would not have been nearly as serious. I think its safe to levy most of the blame on those who were not vaccinated.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Vaccinated people could still get the disease that they've been vaccinated for.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're right of course. But we know that the majority of those who were infected with measles did not have the vaccine, so clearly the vaccine is beneficial.

        Yeah, that's what they say about the flu vaccine.

      <p>
       34 of 28 means that 6 of the children had vaccinations for Measles and they still got the Measles which means that the person who spread it might have been vaccinated as well.

       Just face it, you don't really know and you're just spreading fear that isn't warranted yet.  Remember a while ago when they said the Bird Flu and the Pig Flu were going to be the end of all mankind?  Or at least that what the fearmongers like yourself were spreading.

       This is about whooping cough, but the same applies to the MMR vaccine:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If people really cared about human health, they'd spread far and wide that if you got your MMR after a certain date, it isn't necessarily as effective and that people need to get boosters. Instead, they run around biting each others' heads off, blaming worried parents and repeating stupid death threats...the ironic thing is that most of the Reddit heroes running around screeching are probably not up on their boosters themselves...

       Older people (like 60+) are supposedly immune because measles were rampant when they were growing up. Of course, a lot of them had eye issues because of it, I know multiple people with complications due to eye surgeries necessitated by measles-induced crossed eyes during childhood. I think 70s kids are fine. The information's out there, might take a little digging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Looks like mid- to late-80s they started finding issues in MMR after they discovered measles outbreaks in fully-immunized child populations and started recommending doing MMR boosters - so it must have been released before then -

       I personally wouldn't have a problem taking vaccinations if they didn't contain a cocktail of toxic adjuvants. The elite have their own

      <p>
       Also, the USA has seen a large influx of illegal immigrants over the last year. I wonder what percentage of those people have been vaccinated.

       I know that some people here question vaccinations but I don't think it's conspiracy theorists who are not vaccinating their children. It is the elite who honestly, think it is just a cool thing to do. Some people need to be different, to do and create things to puts themselves on a pedestal. The measles should not exist in our country, and these people are bringing it back. These vaccinations are different than getting a flu shoot.

       Not a doctor, not your doctor, and I don't have kids, but here's my very personal take on it:
      </p>
      <p>
       I know multiple people with eye issues (one blind in one eye, in fact) due to measles outbreaks during childhood. If I had a kid, I would probably immunize them against measles. However, I know families with vaccine-injured children, too, and I've spent some time with the VAERS (vaccine adverse reactions) database. So it's not black and white.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if I had kids, what I would work to try to do is this: Find out which brand name and type of shot my child was given. Write down the lot number. In the event of an adverse effect, this is important stuff to add to VAERS. Too many reports are missing or useless; if there's a bad batch (and this does happen, some interesting/scary stuff related to certain lots of Pneumovax in VAERS), we should do our part to get it fixed and we should all do our part to hold vaccine makers to account for the quality and safety of their product.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also not do what is being pushed now - 5-6 vaccines in a day. Let's ensure my kid is healthy, go get the MMR.
       <sup>
        1
       </sup>
       Let their immune system do what it does, then immunize for whatever other thing we believe may be necessary after the child has fully recovered. That way, too, if there is an issue with a specific vaccine, you know what it truly is. I don't know why the medical establishment doesn't encourage this, really, despite what the pharmaceutical companies want - it's better science, better safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, you think about this, and you see the problem with what i would want to do, right? It's fiddly, it's particular, it takes time and thought, and it doesn't scale with current health plans if you're not financially well off with extra time on your hands. At 100-200/appointment out of pocket and doctors' schedules packed tighter than sardines in a can, how feasible and scalable is it for parents to handle vaccinations this way?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just one of the things I wish the rabid pro-vaxxers would gather together with the rest of us to fight to change and make better, instead of poo-flinging and abuse at 1-2% of the population who opt-out of vaccines. Would make more people vaccinate, which is apparently what they want, and would make it safer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <sup>
        1
       </sup>
       And ohmigod, pay attention to what the healthcare worker is doing. One of the recent VAERS entries I saw was where the practitioner switched the kids vaccines, so the baby got loaded with the 5 year old's vaccines, like five or six of them at once. Terrifying.

       They can't scare people with flu since their swine flu clusterfuck; they need something with a little more oomph to get them to act against their intuition in the matter of vaccinations in-general, and the ebola thing didn't really catch on as hoped.

       No way. These vaccinations are required for a reason. There is nothing in these vaccinations that "fuck with the people", it's the opposite.

       Yes, I understand.  Against means not for.  Anti means not doing it.  Not for not doing it = do it.  Except it is bad for you, research shows.
