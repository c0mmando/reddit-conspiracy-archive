       The Israel Lobby, Oil and Gas Lobby, Military-Industrial-Complex and Financial Industry are behind the wars in the Middle-East.
      </p>
      <p>
       The major reason for the wars in the Middle-East is the The Yinon Plan for Greater Israel, a strategic plan to ensure Israeli hegemony in the region by breaking up the existing Arab states into smaller weaker states. ISIS and Al Qaeda have been funded to help the West achieve this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wars in Iraq and Syria are also over control of the oil and gas pipelines in the region, while in Afghanistan it's well documented that the CIA and U.S. Military protect and control the Afghan opium trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drug trafficking constitutes one of the 3 biggest global commodities in cash terms along with the oil and the arms trade, with an annual profit of hundereds of billions of dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whilst Oil is only $110 a barrel, the Heroin trade is worth $20 million a barrel and when cut it brings in $60-80 million!
      </p>
      <p>
       The global drug trade is controlled and run by western intelligence agencies who covertly transport and sell drugs and then launder the money through western banks (which the banks use to prop up their bankrupt international financial system). Diamonds are then bought with this money from the corrupt diamond business families like the Oppenheimers. These diamonds are then sold and the drug money is clean. This money is then used to pay for weapons to arm counterinsurgencies and to pursue covert operations wordwide.

       I mean what happened in France have something do with that to after my believes:
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine">
        According to President Nicolas Sarkozy, "France supports the solution of two nation states living side-by-side in peace and security, within safe and recognised borders."[241] In May 2011, Sarkozy said that if peace talks with Israel had not resumed by September, he would recognise the State of Palestine as part of its bid at the United Nations.[242] This echoed statements made in March by Nabil Shaath, who claimed to have received a promise from France that it would recognise in September a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.[243] According to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, however, Sarkozy had said that France's support would require the Palestinians to recognise Israel as the state of the Jewish people.[241] This was confirmed in July, when Foreign Minister Alain Juppé stated that any solution to the conflict would require the recognition of "the nation-state of Israel for the Jewish people, and the nation-state of Palestine for the Palestinian people."[244] This broke with the European Union's traditional position, which adamantly opposes any mention of Israel as a Jewish state.[245] Sarkozy later went full-circle on this policy, reportedly saying that the idea of a Jewish state was "silly".[246] In August, Sarkozy stressed the importance of a united EU position on the September initiative, and proposed a compromise where the State of Palestine would be given observer status instead of full membership. The proposal, which was to prevent a split among members of the EU, included a promise from Paris and other members that they would vote for the resolution.[247][248]
        <strong>
         In October 2014, France's foreign minister said France would recognise a Palestinian state even if peace talks with Israel fails.[249] On 2 December 2014 the French National Assembly approved a non-binding motion calling on the government to recognising Palestine
