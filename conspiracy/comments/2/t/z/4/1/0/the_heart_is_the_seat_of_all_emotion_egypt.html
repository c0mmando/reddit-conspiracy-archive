      <p>
       In this thread I will briefly describe how the heart effects, inter alia, thought and emotion. As the Egyptians transcribed, 'the heart is the seat of all emotion' and with my modern day experience added in, I can safely say that it is also the subconscious, and thus, the source of Man's thought. When we think of a subject, it's by a prompt from the heart (~in the form of a "!") to the mind ("?"), whether this be by natural instinct or through the subliminal; nature or nurture. A thought-prompt is a signal sent by the heart, and it's not originally worded-- it takes mental power to word 'a real cat' for example. All hearts are connected by virtue of them being hearts, call it a special relativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does a thought-prompt emerge? When hearts cross, instinct arises... And this is the primary reason the heart prompts the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       If my body, naturally, begins to align with a cat's heart some moments before I think of it, then I will be prompted by my heart, and this prompt will likely turn into a thought; a soft proof of this fact is that when I have not experienced what a cat is, I will not think of it because I don't know it exists, and therefore our hearts cannot be aligned; however, a paternalistic hand can change this malleably. Worded thought is like an "iron sceptre" that we use to excite and torment our heart into omission of certain subjects; we can manipulate a prompt from the heart, we can change it's course with spoken and acknowledged word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take for example the word "rat", it rhymes with the word "cat", and if I'm caught in rhythm then I may think of cats because I was thinking of rats; this is but one example of how our hearts are manipulated by the word (base-symbol language) of the tongue in the mind. This means that my teacher may cause an alignment between my heart and a cat's heart, and thus cause me to think of a cat; assimilation of a cat's heart is not a requirement since my teacher or a teacher in the cycle of teaching, had assimilated it, so it's a silent passage through the subconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of the heart as an engine to the mind; all movements of a human, or cat, are coming from their heart, at the source, but movement is henceforth controlled by the mind; it's possible to for the mind to follow the heart's command, and vice versa; for example, in situations where we are scared, we will instinctively try to pacify our emotions so that we become fearless again-- we are following the heart and it's output here, and not the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       A metaphorical example: if I take my foot off of the acceleration pad of a car, then I will still be in motion, and I'm left to keep control of the torque of the engine's prior output, that's unless, amongst other things, I choose to put my foot on the brake and come to a halt. The flow of nature makes it so there are lots of moments wherein we can follow our hearts, such as by meeting someone we like or someone that we don't, hunger or fear, whatever the case is, sometimes we submit to the pulse of emotion and follow the commands given by the heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: After researching for a while, I have decided that the heart is not the subconscious, but, it has a massive influence on the subconscious.

       What are you following here? Because. you're clearly not following the mind; you didn't even elaborate (although I know that your genetics and probably unluckiness in life makes you do this on purpose) on the point you made. You didn't understand the original post, as per, "Erm, wha?" ad infinitum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elaboration: so you're following the heart; you're being emotional and allowing the heart to control your response; "This is so stupid it's funny", but remarkably you cannot explain "why?"-- thus, there is less "mental power" involved than physical power. Where does the physical power come from? Read the original post, properly this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something actually funny: he's allowing his emotions to dictate his thought-- he thinks the mind is the seat of all emotion.

       Good question: planet's have cores which are relative to hearts in the same way a car's engine is relative to a heart. A cell phone, is created from matter/energy, so you're aligning with the matter-of-the-subject, rather than it's heart. You also may connect with it's core, it has a central point of physical power (~a car's engine), thus, it's still 'hearts versus hearts'.

       The brain receives stimuli that causes emotion, it's brain activity but it's not "an activity of the brain", it's an activity of the heart. Heartbeat sends the chems in your body wild, it's this engine-like organ that processes all emotion, the brain just receives it. You obviously have a materialist philosophy

       It doesn't think, it is like an engine, it creates emotion for the mind to receive. You are half-right but half-wrong, and you are in denial about having a materialist philosophy.

       You misunderstand the original post if you think the heart 'experiences' emotion. You use your arms to lift something, your legs to walk, your heart to empower your arms and legs, as well as mind. It's the seat of all emotion, the source, not the receptor. Learn or move on blissfully ignorant.
