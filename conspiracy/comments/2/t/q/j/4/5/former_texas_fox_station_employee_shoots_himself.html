<p><strong>Shout Out</strong> thanks uniqueLo!</p>

<p>&quot;A former employee of a Fox station in Texas shot and killed himself outside the front doors of the News Corporation building shortly before 9 a.m. Monday, a law-enforcement official said.</p>

<p>The building houses 21st Century Fox and News Corporation, which owns The Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>The man, Phillip Perea, 41 years old, of Irving, Texas, shot himself once in the chest outside of 1211 Avenue of the Americas, the official said. Mr. Perea had previously worked for a Fox station in Austin, Texas, police said.</p>

<p>Mr. Perea had also been handing out fliers, which criticized his employer for having “ended my career,” moments before he shot himself, the official said.</p>

<p>Kris Lew was preparing to open a coffee-and-food cart, the Cinnamon Snail, on 48th Street at about 7: 45 a.m. when she “heard two shots—‘Pop. Pop.’—really quick,” she said. “I know what gunshots sound like…It was a thing where I thought to myself, ‘Those sound exactly like gunshots, but it can’t be, because we’re in Rockefeller Center.’”</p>

<p>A suicide note and a gun were recovered at the scene, the official said. Mr. Perea took to his Twitter page about an hour before the shooting, further criticizing his former employer and linking to a more than 8-minute YouTube video laying out his complaints.</p>

<p>He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later, police said. A phalanx of New York Police Department detectives were at the scene investigating Monday and access to the building was restricted.</p>

<p>Are you seriously suggesting that it&#39;s impossible to shoot yourself in the chest twice?</p>

<p>You do realize that a bullet to your chest isn&#39;t going to instantly kill/disable you right?</p>

<p>A person can very easily shoot themselves 2 times in the chest, you just point it at yourself and squeeze the trigger twice in a row.</p>

<p>What&#39;s so funny?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is this how you converse w anyone who doesn&#39;t readily agree w you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. It&#39;s how I converse with &quot;skeptics&quot; who are incapable of considering that individuals are all unique, and do not all do actions the same way that others have done those actions.</p>

<p>Suicide is a very broad action that can be accomplished by many means.</p>

<p>People are also in various states of suicidal depression which helps determine what method they will use to attempt to kill themselves with based on how serious the suicidal thoughts are.</p>

<p>I live right next to a train line, and there have been multiple suicides on it over the course of the past 5 years. Those people obviously wanted to kill themselves with no risk of it messing up, which is why they choose the blunt force trauma of a train.</p>

<p>It weighs how many tons, is metal, and is traveling at speeds of over 40 miles per hour. It will kill you on impact, hands down.</p>

<p>Now, some people do not have easy access to a train they can just hop in front of, but they do have easy access to a knife or a gun.</p>

<p>In these instances, they either fail or succeed, but they do not all attempt the action in the same manner.</p>

<p>Kurt Cobain blew his head off with a shotgun. This one dude put a revolver in his mouth at a public meeting and blew his brains out in front of a whole bunch of people.</p>

<p>What&#39;s so unbelievable about a person shooting themselves in the chest twice?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe I used the word &quot;truly&quot; based on my own experiences of being suicidal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because only your anecdotal experience counts and makes the use of &quot;truly&quot; okay, because you have the authority to speak on whether people truly intended to kill themselves or not when they attempted to commit suicide................</p>

<p>And likewise you have nothing to say because your skepticism was unfounded in the first place.</p>

<p>Again, just because the guy wanted to die, doesn&#39;t mean that he didn&#39;t want to die with some sense of dignity. People count not having your head disfigured from blowing your brains out as dying with some sense of dignity, as it allows people to look at their dead face at their wake.</p>

<p>The creepiest shit about this? If this guy was trying to stage a protest/draw valid attention to FOX, he has enough YouTube uploads that his voice could be captured and this last video be easily created. Granted, dude could be a total narcissist and this was his last missive to the world. I&#39;m not gonna watch all these videos, but it seems like there&#39;s no live video of the speaker, just the soundbar graphic and slides. His cadence is weird. At times, it sounds MECHANICAL...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he was shot in the chest, I think he was sized as a security threat and treated as such. I doubt there&#39;s a conspiracy behind that, just a revelation that some building security forces will use lethal force (and everyone is okay with that). Listening to the videos, this guy doesn&#39;t seem to know anything critical or be any realistic threat to anyone; he wasn&#39;t worthy of being assassinated. </p>

<p>The audio files are interesting drama. The dude is a narcissist, melodramatic, and extremely pedantic, but Lorena is an idiot and his managers don&#39;t know how to handle this problem (of them not being compatible work partners). They should have fired both of them long before this guy wrote a one hundred page rebuttal to an HR complaint about him.  </p>
