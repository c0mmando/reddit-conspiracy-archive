    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely with the OP. When questioning any conspiracy, always follow the money. The documentary &quot;History of Money&quot; is a very good documentary to watch. Well worth the time.</p>

<p>Edit: left out a word.
Edit: My apologies. The video in question is only one part, not three. The <em>web</em> article is three parts.</p>

<p>Pontius Pilate ultimately found no wrong doing on the part of Jesus, but allowed the crucifixion even against the area laws to prevent a riot. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>To a certain point I would agree. However, in our 21st Century society we don&#39;t need guns to survive (except possibly in Baltimore or Detroit) but we <em>do</em> need money to survive, unfortunately.  You do have a point to say that money is merely a tool used to dominate others, but, this tool has been crafted in an evil manor Eons ago, by the &quot;Money Changers (read: Jews - the ethnic race, not the religion)&quot; to have the effect that it does today. </p>

<p>Therefore, yes, money <strong>is</strong> evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money, and to the greater extent any inanimate object, cannot be evil per say.  However, to allude that money directly or indirectly is not a problem is perpetuating a blatant lie routinely held / promoted by people that love the monetary system, or stand to benefit from it, or simply someone that has been victimized by the lie or willfully chooses to remain ignorant.</p>

<p>First of all, money is the root mechanism that creates financial inequality in a society that depends on money for even the very basic needs of sustaining life for most individuals in society.  It creates a game that allows for winners, at the cost of creating and benefiting off of the misery of a loser. The more wealth one wins, the more wealth the others lose.  In this game with a society of billions, the game has progressed to the point that now very few hold wealth that is disproportionate to the average holdings by yields of thousands. </p>

<p>The last time you played monopoly, how fun was it once that one person started to accumulate All of the wealth / resources?  Pretty boring right, because there was no social mobility, just like in our current socieities, very little social mobility, odds are Heavily stacked against you. Money in this context, has allowed the biggest pyramid to ever be built, off the labor of everyone elses misery, I am talking about 1% of the population by next year having more wealth then the rest of the 99% population, &#39;Combined&#39;.  This has resulted in a billion people starving to the point of death every year, billions more in destitute poverty, and billions more just living month to month in western socieities just barely getting by.</p>

<p>Additional to creating this vast inequality is the fact that it promotes Coersion, violence, manipulation, theft, lying, just the worst qualities in humans.  And why or how does it promote these rotten qualities? because You Directly stand to &#39;Benefit&#39; from other peoples misery. In this game of Capitalism / free market, we are all in Competition (highly inefficient compared to cooperation/collaboration, but another topic for that), and in this state of competition person (A) is trying to screw over Person (b) more then person (B) can suck over person (A).  In capitalism, the person that can better screw over the other to garnish the upper hand over the other (by coercion, lying, stealing, killing, violence, manipulation, etc etc) is the winner, the one we all call being &quot;successfull&quot; in western society.  </p>

<p>Are you truly *<strong><em>&#39;n surprised we are all killing eachother, lying to each other, screwing each other harder then the other person, moving crazy &#39;psycopaths&#39; to the top of this chain as successful  people, given we have a system (monetary system) that Directly 100% &#39;Promotes&#39; those values? Please do not act like you are shocked.  If you want a society that is not plagued with scumbagary, you cannot *</em></strong>&#39;n realistically achieve that with a society built on the monetary system that Directly every way possible creates, promotes, nurtures and benefits from those behaviors.  It creates the disgunting &#39;Evil&#39; Environment we have now.  It would be insane to think you can achieve otherwise with this system in play, it is impossible!  So to answer your statement, Yes Money does create and promote the &#39;Evil&#39; behaviors we are seeing in all 200 countries that use the &#39;monetary system&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have mixed feelings about it.</p>

<p>However, if we agree that government is essentially a mafia or cartel, that steals our wealth at the point of a gun through taxes, we can see that using government  issued money helps or enables this theft, making our enemy stronger. If we could use only non trackable mediums of exchange like some digital currency, or traded and bartered with goods and services using only methods that could not be tracked, and refused to accept govt issued money on the grounds that it makes our enemy stronger, collectively we might be able to weaken our enemy. But nobody seems willing to refuse to accept money</p>
