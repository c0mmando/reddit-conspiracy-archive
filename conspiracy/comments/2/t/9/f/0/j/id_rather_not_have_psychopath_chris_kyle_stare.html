       The point of the propaganda is to spread it. In this case, it doesn't matter if people believe it's propaganda, because it's trying to reach psychopaths. The more this image propagates, the more psychopaths see a role model in Chris Kyle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, I don't even know if this is Chris Kyle or the actor portraying Chris Kyle... though I'm guessing the latter. But come on, put up a documentary or something, not this memetic warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: It's been changed. Thanks whoever!

       I have had ESPN on all day quite a bit for the last couple weeks and one of the things I have noticed is that starting with the early morning shows and throughout the day
       <em>
        every single different program
       </em>
       has mentioned and talked about American Sniper and what a great movie it is. All of them also make a point that everyone should go see it, you know, because it's
       <em>
        such
       </em>
       a good movie. Not too mention the movie being heavily advertised in the commercial breaks on their network, but this is not surprising, it is television after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This cannot just be a coincidence, I can see someone on one show, maybe even 2 or 3, but not every single program throughout the day, across both ESPN 1 and ESPN 2. I started noticing it a couple days ago, and started to wonder if maybe this was because this movie was produced by Disney or one of their media subsidiaries (Disney also owns ESPN).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because sports and the military are well known to be different parts of the same propaganda apparatus it would seem to be just a little more evidence that American Sniper is first and foremost a classic piece of American war propaganda and is being pushed heavily on to the American population, especially males in the military service age demographic.

       Without radar guns that can see through walls, how else are police going to know whether the guy that some other guy said his drug dealer told him might be selling pot is in the house, before, ya know, they bust down the door, 20 militarily armored S.W.A.T. agents storm in, backed by an armored tank (for whatever reason), shoot the guys kid (for whatever reason), don't find anything, walk out, and never apologize for it? Then what? Sharia law? Is that what you want?

       Tons of pro-military folks have been brigading every single thread where Chris Kyle is negatively mentioned. I was arguing with a guy in a chain ~12 comments deep (where no one else actually comes across it) and in about an hour all of my comments were -7 and all of his were +8. Not a conspiracy necessarily, just brainwashed idiots doing the goverments work for them.

       Do you guys think that Bradley Cooper is aware at any level of what's going on? Did he do it for the money? The recognition?

       This probably isn't the right thread for those questions but I hate knowing an actor I enjoy would perpetuate this shit. If anything I should prepare myself for disappointment.

       I wanted to add that Bradley Cooper aside from starring, also was a producer of the film and originally bought the rights.  This guy has a shit ton of money so I doubt that was a motive.  More than likely, a good story to tell with a chance to expand his acting chops.

       Ok, I looked up the guy, and I think it's relevant. Critiquing propaganda creates its own countermemes. Like if you had this image inset in an old-looking TV set, with a caption "American Propaganda", that's better. The replicated image is overlayed with obsolescence, and I'm more receptive to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think the actors just do it for the money. Like the Zero Dark Thirty people. They get help from the agencies, but the big-shot Acting Faces -- they don't go there.

       I'd bet there are some avid researchers in the filming and support crew though.

       So actors are simply figureheads in a sense. They emotionally capture people but follow somebody else's orders. Hmm.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm sure some of them are aware. Now the question is what percentage?

       I'd say the people involved in Kill The Messenger are more informed than a Clint Eastwood flick. Though I wonder sometimes if Eastwood knows, and knows to keep mum.

       I heard an interview with Bradley Copper in which he said that he bought and/or got the options to make the movie himself, brought it to the studio, got the funding, Steven Speilberg wanted to directed it but a deal could not be made between Speilberg and the studio, then it went to Eastwood.

       I don't know. It may possibly be able to be compared to the Hitler documentary that was on the sidebar. People jumped on that because Hitler was on the sidebar. Yet it shouldn't be wrong to give light to a documentary that sheds light on an alternate viewpoint.

       The line under the "Chris Kyle" photo says "American Propganda". It's not hiding anything. We seek to discuss the propaganda known as

       Okay, but not this picture. Too threatening and a bit glorifying for those who might be so inclined. Here's my suggested alternative:
       <a href="http://postimg.org/image/3wv1fqvhp/">
        http://postimg.org/image/3wv1fqvhp/
       </a>

       (Although even in that narrative, he'd be one of the paid-off humans rather than the aliens. I'm not sure I could photoshop that though...)

       Meh, I wouldn't be so personable, but I do find it acceptable as a starting-point for discussion. But what about the current picture? It's exactly the propagandistic gun-toting killerman portrayal we're here to disassemble.

       Sure it could be seen as supporting the movie in some sort of sense. Badass sniper pointed at the viewer.

      <p>
       I can't claim to know the intentions of the moderating staff, even if I at times doubt them.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say is even with my skepticism about the movie I didn't think that the moderators chose that picture on purpose with an agenda in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point that you make isn't completely out there but as I said it wouldn't have come to my mind without you bringing it up and that's coming from a person who defends Hitler being on the side bar (because only stupid people cannot entertain an idea without subscribing to it).

       I don't know why this picture was chosen, nor do I have any information about the mods. I'm not claiming they have any particular agenda, other than the obvious one of  moderating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm okay with a Hitler picture, because Hitler is a deeply subverted meme. This one's still active at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, what if there was an Uncle Sam poster instead of that picture, with the same caption. Would that be terribly relevant in this subreddit?

       I think Eastwood knows what's going on, hence the bizarre fake baby scenes. "Remember the incubator baby lie? Here's more of the same", he seems to be saying.

       I've thought as much, but then again we're operating in a realm where parody is indistinguishable from the real deal, so there's no good way to tell... Was he making fun of Republicans when talking to the Obama chair, or was it sincere? Who knows...

       I thought it was a good movie....but a movie none the less....being a free thinker...It didn't make me love Kyle or change my opinon on our government, it's actions or it's evil and greedy agenda's....going into it I was expecting the propaganda shaded movie it was, but it was still entertaining...I have vet friends who have killed people in action...they did what they had to do..they never bragged...they went there with humanity...they came back with humanity....can't be said for every soldier I understand....I don't know how Chris Kyle was prior to war, but imo...as a human, he was one of two things...he either was cold and no one he killed ever weighed on his conscience...or he wrestled with that pain and emotional turmoil on a daily basis...but I digress...was a very entertaining pro American go war propaganda film.

       I think the studio agents picked Bradly to play the role because they want flic / plot to connect with the audience. The government and movie industry understand that people need to emotionally feel something and in this case people would connect to Bradly Cooper based on his last roles. They know he is a good guy going in to battle and try to save the world. Smart people understand one person can't do it alone. What they should have done is find a new unknown actor to play that role.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are just playing with people emotions like toys.

       The thread is about a picture of Bradley Cooper as "Chris Kyle", and OP wasn't sure if it was Bradly Cooper or the actual guy. You said Kyle was dead, as if that information was enough to tell OP who the picture was of.

       Really? Because OP said "image" as in the social understanding of Kyle as a hero, not an actual picture. Are you sure it was me that didn't understand what was being said?

       What OP is talking about is an actual image of Chris Kyle that was embedded into this sub. So there was an actual image of Chris Kyle looking at you through his scope. So you are totally wrong.

       <p>
        Agree on the Kyle, but note that disabling this option, in Preferences, has made me a much, much happier Reddit user in general:
[ ] allow subreddits to show me custom styles
Discovered when that giant blinding red Hitler face was in the side bar. I'm probably missing out on stuff, but probably just missing out on outrage, which I have in steady supply anyway, don't need any more than I got...

       I have not followed the 'the sniper' conspiracy. The post is about that film yes? I don't know, I guessed.
 I hate posts on here that assume you know what they are about. Isn't the point of this sub to reach people with ideas they may not have thought about?

       Why do you think the guy was a psychopath?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because he was a good sniper?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because he was able to snipe without developing PTSD?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because he served in the military?

       I can understand people getting their panties in a wad over the movie if they are worried about propaganda, but the guy served his country at the risk of his own life using a skill set that not everyone can successfully pull off.

       The most fundamental aspect of a psychopath is a lack of empathy. If you don't develop PTSD from killing just a single person, let alone 160+ you are a psychopath by definition.

       Bullshit. You don't have to develop PTSD to prove you aren't a psychopath. Holy fuck, everyone is turning into giant soft weirdos. If civil war ever does break out, as conspiracy theorists tend to hypothesize, you new brand of tin foil hatters are going to be ass raped so hard that you'll forget what it felt like to ever have voluntary control of your sphincter.

       If you kill someone and don't feel bad, something is not right with you. I'm not talking about self-defense. I'm talking about coming from a position of relative privilege (white middle class American), volunteering (not being drafted or conscripted) to go to an elected war in a country that did not attack us, nor had the weapons we claimed, and then kill 300+ people and not even question it or be haunted by that experience. I believe that is classic psychopathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call me soft, but I would not reflexively kill a person who did not threaten me because my state coerced me to, and then never think about it again. I consider that to be insane. Glad you are willing to jump into the next firefight without thought, should bode well for your descendants.

       You're kind of fucked up there, buddy. If you can turn off empathy on command, you've got a psychopathic streak. That's how human brains with properly developed mirror neurons work.

      <p>
       And since you've broached the subject, I'm really sorry your parents, in all likelihood, spanked or hit you, or maybe you were systematically exposed to pain or the threat of pain during childhood. Maybe they were just indifferent to your suffering, I don't know. I'm not even saying this in jest or to deflate your ego.  It's just fucking sad and I'm sorry. The question is, have you understood what's been done to you, or are you just set to repeat the violent cycle?

       It's isnt psychopathic. It's rational.

       I am not a violent person in any way shape or form, other than that I have a firm belief that those people who torture, rape, or murder others should not be in existence any more. I do not support life long imprisonment nor do I think it makes sense to waste resources attempting such a feat.

       I also don't give a crap about destructive cultures that abuse  women, children and the less privileged daily and use religion as their excuse to do it, while simultaneously holding their societies back in ways that are immensely self destructive. Western cultures aren't even close to perfect, but they are a damn good stride in the right direction.

       So though I firmly believe that 9-11 was a sham false flag from the inside, though it is obvious that Saddam never had WMDs, and though Afghanistan and the "Taliban" and now "ISIS" are hyped up to excuse military action for monetary goals, I am also glad that Western actions in the Middle East should move their culture in general towards a better type of society.

       If you want to consider all that psychopathic while you sit comfortably in your relatively short term life span and hope that none of your family members are ever raped, tortured or murdered, whilst enjoying the numerous benefits of a Western culture, then you go ahead and hang out in that bubble and enjoy your role as an obtuse, oblivious, short-sighted judge.

       Okay, I'm glad you're engaging in discussion again. Especially after you've wished anal rape on me -- something which you've not retracted, so I assume it's still something you hold in your heart. That's still kind of fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for now, I'll address your argument, as it's both insightful and flawed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I am not a violent person in any way shape or form,

       I think the true obvious psychopaths should not be exterminated. They're too valuable as means of understanding their condition. They can be use to develop tools to screen for the appearance of spychopathy early, and for developing methods that correct it or keep it in check. Or maybe even put to good use. (Prior to anesthesia, many surgeons were thought to be rather psychopathic, as their work was fast, bloody, and required unflinching dedication. I'd rather have a psychopath surgeon than a bawling crybaby). I don't see the value in exterminating them, but I wouldn't spend any of my time on defending them should a family member seek revenge on a
       <em>
        proven
       </em>
       serial rapist. I also wouldn't force anyone else to pay for the prisons to house them, though I might contribute to them myself.

       Why did you leave out the abuse of men? We care about women and children, but fuck the men? That is a blind spot in your perception.
Aside from that glaring omission, I agree with you. Cultures tolerant of abuse are worse than cultures less tolerant of abuse.

       Okay, I'm with you here. Though I'd add that it's not just about military-industial profits, it's as much about psychological control and trauma-based domination over the Western populations, as well as about keeping the Arab world divided, alienated, and in the dumps, which brings me to my next point...

       And how do you think that's going? The 'Coalition' Invasion came, blew shit up, killed and terrorized random people, and spread depleted uranium casings all over the cities of Iraq. Think about that. the US is directly responsible for dumping nuclear waste all over another country they are supposedly there to 'uplift'. They've got growing cancer rates now, children being born with deformities more than ever, people leaving the cities... It's a fucking mess and a nightmare, and you say Western actions should move their culture towards a better type of society.

       That is decidedly
       <em>

       what's happening. Check out Afghanistan before the Soviets and the the US-backed Mujahideen tore up Kabul. They had universities for women, public services, infrastructure. Now? It's all gone to shit.
Or what about the CIA coup against the democratically elected, secular Mossadegh in Egypt? Yeah, Western action is sure helping those Arabs overcome their cultural baggage.. by blowing their shit up, assassinating their presidents, and irradiating their genetic integrity. Team America fuck yeah!
      </p>

       Seriously, look into the history of Western meddling in Arab affairs, especially since the fall of the Ottoman Empire. You may find yourself being the short-sighted judge.

       Honestly, I don't know what you're referring to.  I was saying Chris Kyle is a psychopath. I conclude this from his actions and his writings. Not all military personnel are psychopaths, but many are.

       wait wait wait, are you saying that US actions in the Middle East have resulted in less rape, torture, and murder? 'Cause last I checked, our boys 'n' girls in uniform were doing plenty of raping, torturing, and murdering themselves. So your solution is to murder, rape, and torture a society out of murder, rape, and torture?
What does my family have to do with this? Are you saying that they're not getting raped
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       the US forces are shooting and raping people in the Middle East? Seriously, is that your claim? Because I find that hard to swallow.

       Let me offer a personal anecdote. I was born in Israel and moved here as a kid. When I lived there, we lived in a part of Jerusalem which is considered occupied, and is replete with checkpoints, soldiers and guards everywhere. To get in and out of my house (like to go to school) we would have to go through a checkpoint where soldiers peeked into the car to see we were not Arabs, etc... I was always told Arabs and Muslims have one goal in life - to kill Jews, period. Everything Israel does is justified and to even question it is antisemitic and self-hating (if you're Jewish). When I moved to California Bay Area, I was BLOWN AWAY by information and stimulus that showed me everything I was taught as a kid was basically lie, even the origins of the Zionist ideology, the borders of Israel, ancient Israel history, etc.. all of that was basically mythology, fabrications, and political propaganda. I realized then and there, that if I had lived in Israel I would have been compelled to do something that I morally abhorrent to me - serve in the military and maybe have to kill another human being for reasons I don't understand. When given the freedom of NOT being a goon for the state, I realized how terrible it would be if I had to live with the thought of taking someone else's life for any reason. In Israel everything is black and white. When you see the gray, you realize that taking actions which cannot be undone (killing someone) is not something that you should ever participate in, because one day you may regret it to the point of suicide (PTSD).
      </p>
      <p>
       So to see a person not even QUESTION his actions, not even wonder whether ONE person that he has killed didn't deserve it, etc... just because he was told to do it - is psychopathic. To be such a complete tool for a killing machine (our military) and not even wonder ONCE, not even suffer guilt, is just mind mindbogglingly cold and I can't think of a more accurate description of a psychopath.  Not to mention how heinous the Iraq war was.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unfathomable to me to kill a person, and not feel bad about it. It doesn't even matter what the context is. If you know you are personally responsible for the end of another person's life, and you have no problem taking more lives without even FEELING BAD, then you are a psychopath and no kind of hero.

       Whether or not I am a pussy is irrelevant to the conclusion that Chris Kyle is probably a psychopath. It's interesting that you did not dispute this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you wan to worship a psychopathic hero? Trawl reddit for any threads with his name and call the critics pussies and faggots? Well, that's your call. Just be careful about calling people neckbeards, neckbeard.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a bit sad that the best defense you can muster is "you're a pussy". You don't know how to discuss, so your next best idea is to shut down conversation and bolster your ego by ignoring dissenting opinions. Don't worry, you're far from the only one who does this, but that doesn't make it any less sad.

      <p>
       Of course, since the above was a drive-by comment -- or, dare I say, a snipe -- you won't respond to this. further entrenching yourself in your pinned down position. Except there are no bullets flying, it's all just in your head again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to share your actual perspective with me? Well, you've already lost your credibility by marching in and calling me a little pussy straight out the door, but shit, give it a try, you just might surprise me.

       Don't worry. It has to start/stop somewhere. It's not always hypocritical. A heroin abusing parent can still tell their child not to use heroin. Sure it may get heroin into the mind of the child but it doesn't hurt the message.

       ehh yeah i believe it's propaganda but i don't really see him as a psychopath. i've known several soldiers and a few who actually killed people. mostly they view it as doing whatever they can to save their fellow marines. a bullet in one guy's head could be preventing other bullets from traveling into your comrades' heads. i guess people can justify anything. but i don't equate that with psychopathy. we are all capable of killing people, especially when we perceive it as self defense. yeah, he was suckered into invading another country, but that doesn't make him a psychopath.
      </p>
      <p>
       the real psychopaths are the ones who fabricated evidence that saddam hussein bought yellow cake uranium, then sold it as an excuse to send our soldiers to die in iraq, instead of live defending our nation's borders. that's my opinion of the war in iraq. i don't blame the soldiers just because they end up serving as pawns in a globalist plan. one way or another, you and i are serving as pawns in the same plan. especially now that our data is being used simultaneously by hundreds of globalists for various purposes. he was probably brainwashed, but he was trying to do right by his people.
      </p>
      <p>
       he also lied on numerous occasions to make his book more exciting, so i'm not saying he was a saint either. but none of us really know who the man actually was. he's dead, so he can't defend himself either. it's one thing to call reagan a psychopath, because even though he's dead, we already pretty much know he was a piece of shit. in this case, all we have are statistics about how many confirmed kills he has. the military never accused him of killing innocents either, by the way... while numerous other soldiers accused of killing innocent people have been prosecuted and put in jail for it. this leads me to suspect that if he did kill innocent people, it's likely nobody saw it. we just don't know. and because of that, it's really messed up that we shit all over him.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm also not saying that his image and story should be appropriated for statist propaganda... no way, no how. that's not cool either. but we also shouldn't be appropriating his
       <em>
        largely unknown
       </em>
       personality as an example of a psychopathic murderer doing his government's bidding at the drop of a dime. it's the same thing either way. we should stick to vilifying people whose psychopathy we can actually confirm. there are enough confirmed government-associated psychopaths that we can get our image out there without accusing potentially innocent
       <em>
        dead people
       </em>
       of the same crime. it's cruel and unnecessary if you ask me.

       I guess my test would be whether he boasted about his kills. It's true, the guy's dead and so is his side of the story. And indeed, I'm commenting from ignorance on the contents of the film, though I'm decently aware of the actual story as it's been told through the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe he's not a psychopath. Though there are some rumors floating around, and as I understand it, he boasted about his kills. My general point about propaganda still stands though, even if you replace "psychopath" with the more accurate "hired killer".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like hired killer Chris Kyle staring down his rifle at me in this subreddit as the default picture, whether or not this is labeled as propaganda.

       well boasting about your kills doesn't mean you're a psychopath if you dehumanized the people you killed. he's just a bigot, manufactured by the environment in which he lived. psychopaths are pretty much born without empathy. chris kyle had empathy for his wife and kids, he had empathy for his fellow soldiers, and he
       <em>
        sure as hell
       </em>
       had empathy for the psychotic veteran he spent substantial time helping out. kyle knew the guy was unstable and potentially violent. but kyle also knew he was working on it, and he wanted to help the guy get his shit together. he had
       <em>
        empathy
       </em>
       for him... to such a fault that, even though his wife was worried about his safety, kyle walked himself into a death trap just to help the guy. he did this with several veterans. he volunteered his time to support them in any way he could.
      </p>
      <p>
       he may have boasted about his kills, but that makes him a brainwashed man with a lot of testosterone, not a true psychopath. either way you put it, the movie is not about how chris kyle did the right thing, or how the war in iraq was justified. the movie was about the gray areas involved in going to war for your country. the movie featured many dissenting, jaded, and disillusioned opinions. kyle had to contend with his best friend expressing disillusionment with the purpose for the war, and that same friend dying on the same exact mission. kyle had to get through that somehow, and he chose to harden his shell and say that his friend died because he gave up on their cause. he buried his insecurities deep down. he's a human, after all. i thought it was a very poignant scene, which showed us how people can become
       <em>
        hired killers
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       the movie was not necessarily propaganda, honestly. the average viewer roots for chris kyle in the same sense they root for any protagonist in a movie that features general badassery. it's fun to watch, simple as that. but it also features a lot of deeper characters, situations, and behaviors which imply moral gray areas. it begs the viewer to question their pre-conceived beliefs multiple times throughout the film. i went into the film expecting it to be a pile of war propaganda bullshit... and after watching it, i felt quite a bit of empathy for the guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       before you ask, though, yes i feel empathy for the nazis who did terrible things because they were brainwashed and/or afraid to dissent in a fascist society with a heavy cultural repression of dissent. they are not "bad" human beings. they were not born that way, and they certainly did not choose to be that way. we can explain a lot of horrific things outside of free will, honestly maybe every horrific thing. free will is a tricky subject. the brain, as an aspect of the physical universe, is a deterministic system. every single behavior of every single brain can be traced back along the arrow of time in a cause/effect system. every single internal decision, which you would call a "cause" to the "effect" of killing people, for example, can trace its own roots back to an external cause. when we make decisions, there is always an external cause at the end of the chain. internal causes result in other internal causes, yes. but the first internal cause always comes from an external cause. either social, cultural, biological, or otherwise. i can't say this man is a great hero and not say his nazi counterpart is not a great hero. they both saved lives on their side, and exterminated lives on the other side. it's pretty much war that's the bad guy, since war caused all of this in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, we should punish and blame people for their behavior, or else there will be no
       <em>
        deterrent
       </em>
       to that behavior. the deterrent will help to balance out the internal and external causes of bad behavior. there will always be internal and external causes of bad behavior, horrible behavior, murderous behavior, etc. but if we offer significant deterrents, such as legal punishments, it will play into each individual's decision-making process. when he's considering the things that make him willing to kill, he will also end up considering the consequences of killing.
      </p>
      <p>
       obviously since chris kyle's government condoned his killing, he had no legal deterrents to this behavior. he also had extra cultural motives to kill. if he were in the civilian world, would he have killed anybody? would people have
       <em>
        any idea
       </em>
       to point him out as a psychopath? nope. some might say he joined the military so he could kill people. others would say the military caused him to kill people. but it doesn't really matter, because each and every one of us is capable of killing people under the right circumstances. even if he joined the military so he could legally kill people, is that any worse than the military pressuring him to kill people? if we ask ourselves why he wanted to kill people in the first scenario, invariably the answer will never arrive on free will. it will always be because of some external cause. even if he was a true psychopath, there will be genetic, epigenetic, developmental, and hormonal causes. truly out of his control. if he was indoctrinated to kill people, also out of his control. nobody
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       kills on free will. they may choose to do it, but they made that choice for a reason, and that reason came from another reason, and up the chain we finally get a ton of different reasons that came from something completely outside of himself, which ended up warping due to random chance inside his brain.

       it's convoluted and pointless to even talk about, but there is no refutation of it. it's simply the truth. there's no such thing as good or evil when you really sit down and think about it. there's just this enormous spectrum of human behavior which is affected by an infinite number of different things, and trying to make sense of it is pretty much pointless. what we can all agree on is that we want freedom and safety. and chris kyle has pretty much no effect on my freedom or safety, so i don't feel like his family deserves his memory to be shit on by keyboard warriors, liberal snobs, social justice tumblrites, etc. it's just stupid. until we've walked a mile in his shoes, nobody can really talk. same goes for charles manson. i don't want him in society because he's a risk to my security, but i don't have any quarrel with his memory. idk maybe i'm defending an indefensible opinion, but i just feel like it's silly to get all worked up over a feel-good movie. especially when the movie says nothing good about the war or the government that ordered it. all it does is portray heroism, bravery, and physical finesse, which are things that people always love to see in movies regardless of the context. there are a lot of other things that could be said about why some movies like this aren't harmful and are even necessary, but this post is already getting super long.

       I'm pretty sure at least some are wholly unable to kill another human under any condition. It's probably a small percentage though, single digits at most. But your general point stands, and it is the conditions under which one would be moved to homicide that are the subject of scrutiny. Uncle Sam says killing's okay if you wear his fatigues. I think that killing on command is A Bad Thing To Do.

       I am not in any of those categories. His memory speaks for itself -- he lived by the trigger, and died by the trigger... There is a tragedy in his story, as there is usually a tragedy in the lives of nearly all killers. (Yes, even the Tragedy of Hitler -- perhaps especially so.) The suicide rates in the military these days speak to this sad truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that people can be 'brainwashed' into thinking a war is defensive. And as the Milgram Experiments showed, all it takes is a lab coat and a firm, authoritative command to make the average person deliver a fatal shock to another average stranger.

      <p>
       This does not make them any less responsible for their actions. Unless there's a gun to your head, you have a choice. Nevermind free will for now, people experience choice and are statistically observed to make choices. Chris Kyle was the victim of a killing idea. Yes, he may have been vulnerable to it from the start. But that is no absolution, but a mark that those around him did not help.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a soldier buddy's doubts once they're already in the shit and bullets are flying is just a tad too late to start thinking about right and wrong. You've said it's pointless to discuss, so I will simply state that good and evil exist as classes of behaviors (along with neither-good-nor-evil).

       My post focused on Chris Kyle because that's what was in the sidebar. If it had been Gen. Martin Dempsey there, I'd kindly ask for his face to be removed from the sidebar as well (though for different reasons, as I explained with my blurb about this particular picture as propaganda in the original post).

      <p>
       Just because some people you disagree with are hating on this guy, doesn't mean he (or his meme) shouldn't be the subject of ostracism. Let the divided-and-conquered of the political spectrum lob hypocritical grenades at each other. Let them fight it out until exhaustion. Let us instead consider issues on their own merits, and not on their political value.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from my perspective, when I consider this situation, and from what (little) I've read about the guy, Chris Kyle still looks like a murderous psychopath. At least that's the image we've been handed. Let us call it for what it truly is.

       it's true but imagine him after his first tour. sitting at home, knowing his friends (brothers in his mind) are still out there, getting killed and attacked every day. maybe they were there for all the wrong reasons, but can you really fault him for trying to save as many of his friends as possible? that's pretty much the job of an overwatch. he wasn't a sniper in the traditional sense of the term. in iraq, snipers were hardly ever used for assassination missions. their primary job was overwatch... watching over door-to-door raids. and that was actually portrayed pretty well in the movie. also let's not forget that every single one of chris kyle's deployments involved overwatch in a city/town that had already been evacuated and turned into a no-go zone. the only people he was shooting at were those who came back to the town after evacuation. the only reason to come back to the town would be to try and kill the american invaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       i see chris kyle as someone who was trying to make his comrades' mission safer by using his own unique skills. if it weren't for him, it's possible a lot of marines would have died. is that a good thing? even if the marines were in the wrong, they still had families back home who depended on them. when he said he enjoyed killing insurgents, i don't see anything wrong with that either. every great warrior in the history of mankind has
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to enjoy killing his enemies. it's the only way to psychologically deal with continuous murder. he may have helped clear the way for corrupt corporations to rape iraq for its natural and monetary resources, but he also tried to kill as many insurgents and snipers as he could, before they could kill his comrades. in my mind, that was his mission. not bringing democracy to iraq. not hurting innocent people. those are his own words... he went there to save the people he knew, not to rescue iraqis from saddam hussein. is that cold? i don't think so. i don't give a fuck about people i don't know either. if i can help them without getting hurt myself, then i will help them. but in a situation like that, my primary focus would be saving as many comrades out there as i could.
      </p>
      <p>
       if he was out there shooting random people, sure he'd be a psychopath. but that's absolutely not what he was doing. all of his recorded kills were on combatants. he didn't kill a single person who wasn't found armed with a weapon. he was an overwatch so that's pretty much his job. kill snipers and bombers. yeah maybe those snipers and bombers were trying to protect their homeland, but not really. they were the same people murdering other muslims who didn't agree with them. murdering muslims for not paying tribute. they were doing terrible things, at least as bad as what the US troops did. they were brainwashed themselves. so i can't condemn chris kyle without condemning them too.
      </p>
      <p>
       and frankly, if a murderous psychopath hopped on a plane to iraq right now, with the mission of killing as many ISIS combatants as possible, and savoring every minute of it, could we really fault him? yeah he's a murderous psychopath, but at least he's taking it out on people who are a serious danger to the world. he's saving lives by killing murderers. sounds like dexter, and i know it's a huge oversimplification, but it's the best i can do lol. i think every human is capable of killing, and enjoying it. i've never killed someone but i've read a book by a military pscyhologist about the same topic. humans are animals, man. if you've got to kill a hundred soldiers you don't know to save one of your close friends or family, i think you'll do it. and after you've done it, are you gonna say "i feel terrible, i'm so sorry i'm so sorry," or are you gonna say "i had to do it. i have no regrets. in fact, i enjoyed it"?
      </p>
      <p>
       one of those phrases perpetuates guilt and general mental stress. the other helps you recover and get on with your life. i wouldn't fault you for coping with what you did by twisting it into some kind of game. that's just life... a game. anyway the game is all over for chris kyle now. he's gone and he'll never be back. his consciousness is wiped into nothingness. we will never be able to pick his brain and identify whether he actually had empathy for the people he killed, but was just coping with it by hardening his heart. it's too late to identify whether he was really a psychopath. and for that reason, i think it's wrong to label him a psychopath. now that he's dead it's suddenly okay to call him a murderer. he can't defend himself. if he lived long enough he might have had time to write a book about how he really felt, if he really did have some empathy for them. but he died prematurely. maybe he never had any sympathy, but maybe he did. we can't just condemn him without knowing how he truly felt.

       I can fault him for making the choices that led to his presence in that situation.Once there, I understand that his options become constrained to pretty much "kill or be killed". But he chose those constraints -- he wasn't drafted, or coerced into getting into the shit. I'll grant him being misled, but being a fool is no excuse for murder.

       How do you know that everyone that was there was a murdering terrorist? Just because the US imposed an evacuation order under penalty of death does not mean that it is just. What if someone was peacefully resisting evacuation orders -- by staying to watch their homes. What if they were concerned about thieves? What if they were sick or bedridden? There's no way you're telling me that everyone that did not leave was fair game for murder. You've been putting too much thought into this conversation to resort to such a trivially invalid -- and abhorrent -- assertion.

       Each of those marines had chosen to put themselves in a kill-or-be-killed situation. Because they are there of their own accord, they are responsible for the actions they take.

       The standard on the US for condemning someone for murdering others is legal proceedings. Not en masse, but for every single person accused. Are you saying there were trials for every person that was killed by Chris Kyle, and that every one of them was found guilty? Of course not. They were just said to have been found with guns. Which, of course, paints them as guilty, with no one to defend their innocence. I'm not saying this is necessarily what happened -- but have you ever heard of cops planting guns on people? (There's also the fact that Kyle apparently bragged about shooting people in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, so maybe he was shooting random people too...)

       There you go, that's the standard. Everyone on the battlefield is responsible for every press of their trigger.

       First, I think you've got some research to do about ISIS if you think it is a threat that warrants preemptive murder. This is

       after all, and I don't think you really mean to advocate for the deaths of Western intelligence assets ; ) .
But let's say we're talking about a Dexter-type guy hunting down universally abhorrent people -- say, serial child abusers, molesters, and murderers. (Like maybe the British Royalty) . Honestly, I don't know how I feel about this. I don't think I'd help him, but I guess I wouldn't stop him either. But only if the guilt of the target is also universally accepted as certain, which is also a bit tricky.
But if I'm not sure of the target's guilt? Of course I'd be against it. I'm pretty sure all those people didn't need to be blown up, bled out, and blown out -- on both sides.

       This is not how emotions work. After the act of killing, you either feel or don't feel like shit. If one does not, you might be a psychopath. If you do, you can repress the feeling or you can accept it. Those that repress it choose to become psychopathic -- that is, they suppress empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great film dealing with this subject from another perspective is the documentary The Act of Killing. Look it up if you're interested, it's a very heavy film but well worth the watch.

       I would. It's derived from propaganda and probably neglect, but you are responsible for your actions. If you choose to fry your brain with drugs, you are reponsible.

       No. By 30 kills, by the time you think killing is a fun game -- by the time you can't tell life apart from Call of Duty -- no matter who you started as, you're a psychopath now. Also, he made up libelous things and boasted of killing civilians during Katrina (-- or is that not true? I haven't found a video of him saying this).

       We don't know how he started, but we know where he ended up. Perhaps he could have recovered, but this seems unlikely. It is indeed sad that he was not given the chance for redemption. But the same can be said of all those Chris Kyle had taken down.

       I don't need to know how a murderer feels to condemn murder. It's important to know, but not necessary. Would you forgive your murder if the murderer felt bad?

       first off, it wasn't an "evacuation order." they went in and manually evacuated every single person from ramadi months before chris kyle even deployed. i know this for a fact because my cousin was in the 2nd battalion to be deployed in iraq. they specifically do this to ensure that anybody in the area is only there for combat reasons. it's pretty much standard practice for any military in the 21st century.
      </p>
      <p>
       meanwhile, marines were
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       there on their own accord. some of them may have signed up intentionally to go to iraq, but the first two years of deployments? no way. not at all. if you sign up for the army right now, in peacetime, you feel relatively sure that you're gonna end up doing nothing but
       <em>
        defending the mainland
       </em>
       . that's the objective of a huge number of soldiers. they join because they want to defend the country from potential invasion, knowing that their mere existence is a deterrent to invasion. people haven't invaded the US in almost a century for a reason. they also recognize that serving in the military has a ton of benefits. some people simply can't afford college at all unless they join the military. it's a decent way to get health insurance, although it's declined significantly in recent years. fact is, most of the people who went to iraq in the first 2 years had no idea they were going to go to iraq. once you've signed up, you do whatever they tell you for minimum 2 years, sometimes 4 years. your deployments are usually a lot less than that, but you don't get to say no, you don't get to just leave once the US actually sends you somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       a ton of people, including my cousin, joined the military thinking the US would probably never go to war again. it was the 21st century, seemed like shit would be pretty chilled out. you can't just blame every marine on those deployments for putting themselves in a dangerous situation. they didn't choose to invade iraq, they chose to defend their country and they were abused by dick cheney, george bush, etc. their lives were worth saving regardless of whether they signed up for the military, especially considering that most of them didn't volunteer to go to iraq. they joined in peacetime and got stuck on a 2-4 year obligation.
      </p>
      <p>
       and no, holding guns doesn't automatically make them guilty. returning to an evacuated region with an AK-47 or an RPG doesn't necessarily make you worthy of execution, but this is
       <em>
        war
       </em>
       ... you don't exactly have time to give every person due process. the exact circumstances of all of his kills are unknown, but the ones portrayed in the movie are confirmed according to the US Navy. the movie only portrayed him shooting people who were about to kill or were engaged in killing US soldiers. does anyone
       <em>
        deserve
       </em>
       to die? no... but if i were in that situation, i would have to make a choice between letting the arab live or saving my friend who's about to get shot. i'm obviously going to kill the arab before he kills my friend. i don't get what is so wrong with that. it's not propaganda, this is literally recorded fact in a number of cases. i don't have time to petition the navy for detailed information about all of chris kyle's recorded kills, but you'd think that if he did something wrong the liberal media would have found out about it through FOIA by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway yeah there's no way to be sure of each target's guilt, but so what? they're dead now and so is he. are we gonna jump to assume that he's a psychopath, or what? there's just no evidence that he was a psychopath, other than vague uncertainty about the identities of those he killed. he bragged about killing looters during katrina, people he didn't actually kill. he also lied about knocking out jesse ventura. but the dude was trying to sell a book. that doesn't make him a psychopath, it makes him a person who will lie for monetary gain. that is a category which includes virtually every human being on the planet, so i don't really fault him. yeah it makes me think less of a person, once i've caught him lying... but i'm pretty sure everybody else i know is also lying and just hasn't been caught yet. he certainly isn't a psychopath for lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       and no you're wrong with respect to what you said about psychology. repression and psychopathy is nowhere near that simple. people don't become psychopaths after repressing empathy or guilt. people are born psychopaths and there are alleles which appear to prove it. repression vs. acceptance is not black and white either. you can repress guilt after killing someone, and later grow to accept it by convincing yourself that you did the right thing and in fact enjoyed it. what you tell yourself, how you feel about it, and the neuroses you might also have, are not all deterministically linked. there is a huge variety of possible combinations and not all humans are capable of each one. it's way too complex for either one of us to speak on.
      </p>
      <p>
       but something i'm personally sure of is that you can't become a psychopath. whatever happened to chris kyle, he didn't become a psychopath. you've conveniently ignored all the evidence of his empathy, such as his sacrifices for his family, his willingness to help other veterans, etc. he literally lost his life trying to help a veteran he knew was mentally unstable. would a psychopath ever do something like that? what could a psychopath possibly have to gain from that?
      </p>
      <p>
       i've actually watched the act of killing, and found it very surreal. believe me i know where you're going with it, but i'm not saying that chris kyle did what he had to do for the good of the country, and that he should be hailed as a hero. i'm saying that he made human choices, and did what he thought he had to do. whether he actually had to do these things is not something anybody here can say for sure. i'm certainly tired of snotty 16-yr-old liberals on tumblr saying he didn't have to do anything he did. how could they possibly know? they've had their whole lives handed to them, and certainly haven't spent a day in ramadi. i don't think chris kyle was a hero to this country. i think he was a badass, and a good character to make a film about, because
       <strong>
        people like to watch films about badasses. it's fun.
       </strong>
       i don't think that people can call him a psychopath after he's already dead, when they simply don't know jack shit about him. to call him a psychopath is to say every sniper, or even soldier, is a psychopath because they volunteer to kill people. there's nothing special about him that makes him a psychopath compared to all the other soldiers, so they've merely charged him as a psychopath because he killed people in a war. that's incredibly stupid. if you're brainwashed enough to kill people, that tells me you're brainwashed. it doesn't tell me you're evil or psychopathic. it tells me you're a human and, like all humans, you're vulnerable to emotional justifications for violence. seeing the twin towers blow up, and being told it was the people in ramadi, and then being told to go to ramadi... i can't really blame him for doing what he did. turns out he was told a lie, but so what? that reflects more on the people who told that lie than it reflects on him. maybe he's a sheep for trusting his government so much, but it's pretty easy for people to trust their government in america. we may take for granted how obvious these conspiracies are, but to most other people they are very well hidden. they expect government tyranny to look like the holocaust. they don't know that the vast majority of germans, even german soldiers, were completely unaware of the holocaust until after the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       and no i don't think that you can ascribe full responsibility to anyone for anything they do. in a legal sense, sure. we are all fully responsible for our own actions unless coerced into doing them. but in a real, physical sense, it's way more complex than that. i'm not gonna base my opinions of someone on black-and-white legal definitions. i'm gonna base my opinion on the actual causes of his behavior, which are probably many and varied.
      </p>
      <p>
       let me give some context. i have severe chronic nerve pain in my shoulder and i was put on hardcore opiate painkillers when i was 13 yrs old. i was kept on huge doses of powerful drugs like fentanyl, dilaudid, opana, oxycodone, and even diamorphine (pure heroin) for almost half my life. naturally i started using higher and higher doses due to tolerance, but i also started using doses higher than what i needed for pain. when things bothered me emotionally i would take more drugs than i needed. when a new law passed that prohibited prescription of diamorphine or extreme IV doses of any opiate for non-terminally ill patients, i was put on fentanyl patches and oral dilaudid pills. they took away my prescription for intravenous dilaudid ampoules. basically the new regimen i was on was less than half as potent as what i was on before. this was a pretty big fucking deal because a) very severe pain, b) very severe withdrawals. it was the same time i went off to college. i met a heroin dealer (black tar heroin is most common in california) and started using street heroin every day. long story short, this fucked with my health and even made me cough up blood for a few months. very strange symptoms. there were a huge number of factors but i couldn't really get through school very well. it was hard for me to stay awake in class, but i couldn't stop using dope. i lost a lot of shit during this period. i sold stuff to afford heroin... i did things i don't even want to admit to get my hands on it. eventually i was so broke i ended up homeless, while still in college. i hardly ate at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       naturally everybody blamed me for all this stuff. why don't you just stop using heroin? i'm running out of space here so i'll just put it as simply as i can. i was born with CRPS, severe nerve pain. i was injected with drugs at an early developmental stage. my destiny was pretty much sealed at that point. i take responsibility, but it's absolutely not simple.

       Damn man, chronic pain from a young age is some serious shit. I really appreciate this context, and I'm also really sorry it got you hooked on heroin.
The part that sucks the most is how you say "naturally, everybody blamed me for all this stuff". I don't really think that's natural, as it's the responsibility of the people that care about you to help out when you're weakened and make mistakes. Needing to handle pain with opiates at such a young age is tragic, as is the resulting habituation of you still-developing organ of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've not had any such hardships myself, but I used to know an ex-heroin user, and she too carried some serious pain with her. In her case it was psychological, but science is pretty sure we experience physical and mental pain through the same brain circuits. In your case, the pain is nobody's fault (or at least of unknown origins), but it is up to those around you to help you address it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also hope you're doing better now. You have the time to have this conversation, so I'm glad you aren't homeless. How do you deal with it these days?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll write another response  to continue our Chris Kyle discussion tomorrow, but I didn't want to wait to respond to this painful piece of context you've provided, and once again I thank you for sharing it.

      <p>
       yeah you bring up a good point. generally people seem to think that the only excuse for using heroin or other opiates is terrible physical pain. but i've experienced terrible physical pain and honestly, sometimes psychological pain is a LOT worse. it can even be more chronic... at least with nerve pain, the brain is capable of kind of ignoring it. psychological pain just perpetuates itself. to me, my emotional pains were as much an excuse to use dope as my physical pains. but the only legitimate excuse i had when dealing with other people was the nerve damage thing. it was an easy out...
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway yeah i am better now. i'm on buprenorphine and haven't used any other opiates in almost 2 years, except for the shit they gave me during and after a surgery i had on the nerve tumor which fucked up my nerve in the first place. the surgery didn't help with the pain but it will prevent the tumor from ever going malignant.. which was pretty unlikely to begin with. actually, they accidentally cut a tiny nerve in my upper chest during the surgery, and now i can't feel pain in this 2 square inch patch of skin at the top of my left sternum, right under my neck. it's really weird... there are these phantom itches and i can't scratch them because the skin doesn't feel any pain. so it just itches and itches and nothing can stop it, it was fucking torture in the beginning. since then i've kind of managed to deal with it through mental acrobatics lol. same with silencing nerve pain, any kind of nerve issues can be sort of shut off by your brain. the communication is not a one-way street, basically. it's hard to explain because it involves "thinking," but not in terms of language or visual feedback. it's just one of the weird parts of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       so yeah i got super loaded during the surgery, i required a lot of dope due to the tolerance which never really goes away, but i voluntarily quit after 2 weeks which i was proud of. i'm still addicted to opiates, but the medication i take keeps me from withdrawing without making me high. it doesn't do much for my nerve pain, but i've learned it's better to live in pain than to be on heroin constantly. things are shitty either way but that's life... being a living organism in this cold, indifferent universe is both terrifying and amazing. it's just a bizarre thing, which i have no words for. looking into the flaws and mutations of life is pretty much the same to me as looking up at the stars. this universe isn't here to make sure i live a comfortable, pain-free life... i'm just a makeshift observer, a guest. so i try to avoid feeling like a victim, except of course when i can play the victim card and get sympathy, money, friends, and even pussy. lol kidding, of course.

       I really want to respond in-depth to this, but I'm afraid I might touch a raw nerve, though not the one that has caused you so much physical anguish. If you think it is of no use to you, I'd rather not be responsible for quite possibly reminding you of even more pain, though I think such knowledge brings one closer to truth and resilience. And often, when faced with painful truths, people nope the fuck out. So for now, I'll just pick out a few things that really stood out at me:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       That's fucked up. The world is fucked up, I know this, you know this. But I'm saying someone around you behaved in a way that was fucked up. You can excuse it and "move on", or you can consider it with great care for your past, present, and future.
      </p>

      <p>
       Yeah man, that's some hard-won truth right there. You certainly don't get to have the comfort blanket of a watchful deity or a karmic blanket, and this is liberating, exhilirating, but also a little bit scary. But those stars up above? You can be one of them. Nearly anyone could with enough power of will. I hope you have not forgotten.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       I wish I could laugh here, but all I feel is sorrow. Being a victim is not a card to play, it is a statement of fact. We men are told to hide vulnerabilities, to man up, to suppress the pain, bite down, and keep on. And it sounds like you've learned this skill masterfully -- indeed, it doesn't sound like you had a choice. It was either that or the agony of a permanently pained mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       But from what you've told me so far -- and I deeply appreciate you sharing it -- you were the victim of a little more than CRPS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to take this conversation into PMs if you want. Or tell me to fuck off if you must. Either way, be well, and may your life be surrounded by people that truly care.

       Wait, wait... so people that join the US Army, Marines, Air Force, or Navy are just so gosh-darned surprised that they get sent out to fight a dubious war? The Marine instructors like to talk about the decorated Smedley Butler as a shining example of the Brave Marine. They omit, of course, his seminal book -- War Is A Racket. And that was in the 30s.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you join the military to defend your contry, and find yourself being sent on a dubious mission, you have a duty to your ethical reputation and your sworn military duty to disobey all unlawful orders. Murder, except in the case of imminent self-defense, is unlawful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this argument works better for the Army Reserves, as there was, to my knowledge,  no history of them ever being sent overseas, But Chris Kyle was no reservist.

      <p>
       With considerable sympathy to their error in judgment -- yes, each and every person that kills for any reason other than imminent self-defense is a murderer, and is responsible for their actions. They all volunteered, and when doubt and uncertainty struck, they stuck to their standard-issue guns.

      <p>
       This is actually pretty good evidence of psychopathy, narcissism and a willingness to manipulate people for short-term gain at the expense of long-term reputation. It's not an open-and-shut case, there's certainly room for nuance. But he's certainly at least
       <em>
        psychopathic
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        manipulative
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As for lying for monetary gain... Have you looked at who sits in the thrones of power these days? They are liars, manipulators, and cheats, and hell, maybe they even have group pedosadist parties with their buddies. Are

      <p>
       I think I accurately outlined all initial emotional possibilites after the moment of killing -- either one feels empathetic sorrow, or does not. No third option in this regard is possible. Beyond that, repression is indeed a complex process fraught with its own frailties and very dependent on a person's already established disposition. I didn't mean to diminish this latter aspect, I only meant to point out that the initial reaction is the true test of psychopathy, and how repression leads to behavior closer to that of the true psychopath -- by convincing oneself to squelch that empathy.

       Psychopathy is a complex interplay between genes and memes. As I mentioned before, epigenetics is where the science is at these days. People with certain genetic predispositions manifest psychopathy more readily than others in a given history of situations. There's a book on this by a James Fallon -- a neurologist and brain researcher who discovered he had the signature brain of a psychopath, yet he developed into a functioning, empathetic human being. He attributes this, somewhat speculatively, to attention, love, and care during his childhood. 
More broadly, there's a lot of data available on peaceful parenting as a means of inoculation from psychopathy.

      <p>
       You're right about this. I'm actually not very familiar with the Chris Kyle story, aside from his military exploits. Maybe he was a Good Guy to his family, though there's a lot of dysfunction that goes on in families that goes completely ignored by those on the outside. We do not, and cannot know the true story of his family life. But hey, Tony Soprano "loved" his family, right? And shit man, Hitler loved dogs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yeah, maybe he was starting the process of coming to terms with the horrors that were brought upon him, and the horrors he brought upon others. I don't know. I'm waiting for the trial of the veteran that shot him to find out more, I think it's scheduled for sometime later this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe he was taken out because his narrative is carefully crafted military propaganda, and he was going to start talking some real truths. We do not know, and probably never will. This is not the only sorrow of this story, but it is the tragic tombstone of Chris Kyle's life.

        I've actually watched the act of killing, and found it very surreal. believe me i know where you're going with it, but i'm not saying that chris kyle did what he had to do for the good of the country, and that he should be hailed as a hero. i'm saying that he made human choices, and did what he thought he had to do.

      <p>
       We completely agree here.

       I sure can, and I sure did : )

       The Act of Killing is a great example of this. Their society is incapable of bringing justice upon these publicly avowed murderers, for the ctizens are held hostage in mind and body. Those that disagree... disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we, from the outside -- we can see it clear as day. There are those that kill on command, and there are those who refuse.

        i'm certainly tired of snotty 16-yr-old liberals on tumblr saying he didn't have to do anything he did. how could they possibly know? they've had their whole lives handed to them, and certainly haven't spent a day in ramadi.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay, snooty young liberals (especially the socialists these days) are a nuisance to deal with, but that does not invalidate my point. Just because racists believe in genetics does not make genetics invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       But those snooty 16-year-olds sure are right when they say Chris Kyle had a choice to
       <em>
        not

       be sniping folks in Ramada.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for being handed lives on a silver platter -- I understand that you've literally had a very painful childhood yourself, and that's a mountain to overcome and probably a heavy burden to still carry... But do not underestimate the degree to which people are treated as inhumate cattle as children. So much psychological pain in the world is a direct consequence of treating children as animals to be commanded... This is why I feel to some extend for Chris Kyle. I don't know what kind of childhood he had, but I'd take a wild guess that it had a high degree of abuse and insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       (As you might imagine, I use a pretty strict definition definition of the term 'abuse' -- in the case of children, the removal of choice that a child is capable of making either by command or on the threat of physical or emotional pain -- that is abuse. Obviously physical abuse is straightforward, I don't think I need to make the case that hitting a child is egregious abuse -- although over half the Western world still seems to do it.)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        i don't think chris kyle was a hero to this country. i think he was a badass, and a good character to make a film about, because people like to watch films about badasses. it's fun.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No doubt he's a good film subject. Especially considering our recent infatuation with The Bad Protagonist. The Sopranos really kicked it off I think, and this is indeed a field rife with artistic potential and expression. It also walks a thin line between exposure and propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is watching badasses "fun"? How badass are the badasses? Have they always been this way? I mean, compare badass Achilles to badass Chris Kyle...

       Again, we know about the bad things he did, and they're pretty damning.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's true, and again, I do give some leeway here. But Chris Kyle just killed way too many people, and too joyously, for me to have much leeway left for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, maybe in time he would have redeemed a part of himself, and it's tragic that he was denied this chance.

       <em>
        Some
       </em>
       things. Like getting paid to be a soldier in a preemptive war, and boasting about all your kills. Anytime a person's choice is not coerced by violence or the threat of violence, they are
       <em>
        responsible for that choice
       </em>
       . To say otherwise is to utterly deny the human ability to come to conclusions and change their minds. Sometimes there are choices, sometimes there are none. I think Chris Kyle's case for responsibility is pretty clear, and I've already given the argument for it.

       And I base mine on three things: Whether his actions were made by
       <em>

       , what was his

       , and what was the
       <em>
        effect

       . The history that led his to his choices is, of course, relevant here, but it is the actions themselves that are to be judged. This is true for you, me, Chris Kyle, and anybody else.

If you think it is of no use to you, I'd rather not be responsible for quite possibly reminding you of even more pain, though I think such knowledge brings one closer to truth and resilience. And often, when faced with painful truths, people nope the fuck out. So for now, I'll just pick out a few things that really stood out at me:

        but the only legitimate excuse i had when dealing with other people was the nerve damage thing. it was an easy out...

       That's fucked up. The world is fucked up, I know this, you know this. But I'm saying someone around you behaved in a way that was fucked up. You can excuse it and "move on", or you can consider it with great care for your past, present, and future.

        being a living organism in this cold, indifferent universe is both terrifying and amazing. it's just a bizarre thing, which i have no words for. looking into the flaws and mutations of life is pretty much the same to me as looking up at the stars. this universe isn't here to make sure i live a comfortable, pain-free life...

       Yeah man, that's some hard-won truth right there. You certainly don't get to have the comfort blanket of a watchful deity or a karmic blanket, and this is liberating, exhilirating, but also a little bit scary. But those stars up above? You can be one of them. Nearly anyone could with enough power of will. I hope you have not forgotten.

        so i try to avoid feeling like a victim, except of course when i can play the victim card and get sympathy, money, friends, and even pussy. lol kidding, of course.

       I wish I could laugh here, but all I feel is sorrow. Being a victim is not a card to play, it is a statement of fact. We men are told to hide vulnerabilities, to man up, to suppress the pain, bite down, and keep on. And it sounds like you've learned this skill masterfully -- indeed, it doesn't sound like you had a choice. It was either that or the agony of a permanently pained mind.

      <p>
       But from what you've told me so far -- and I deeply appreciate you sharing it -- you were the victim of a little more than CRPS.

       Feel free to take this conversation into PMs if you want. Or tell me to fuck off if you must. Either way, be well, and may your life be surrounded by people that truly care.
