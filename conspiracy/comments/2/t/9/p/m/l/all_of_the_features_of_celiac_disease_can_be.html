<p>Celiac disease is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with gluten intolerance and a higher risk to thyroid disease, cancer and kidney disease, and there is also an increased risk to infertility and birth defects in children born to celiac mothers. While the principal diagnostic is autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, celiac disease is associated with a spectrum of other pathologies such as deficiencies in iron, vitamin D3, molybdenum, selenium, and cobalamin, an overgrowth of pathogens in the gut at the expense of beneficial biota, impaired serotonin signaling, and increased synthesis of toxic metabolites like p-Cresol and indole-3-acetic acid. <strong>In this paper, we have systematically shown how all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate&#39;s known properties.</strong> These include (1) disrupting the shikimate pathway, (2) altering the balance between pathogens and beneficial biota in the gut, (3) chelating transition metals, as well as sulfur and selenium, and (4) inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes. We argue that a key system-wide pathology in celiac disease is impaired sulfate supply to the tissues, and that this is also a key component of glyphosate&#39;s toxicity to humans. </p>

<p>The monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and in human urine and blood has been inadequate. <strong>The common practice of desiccation and/or ripening with glyphosate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is true. I think this is the exact reason everyone is suddenly allergic to wheat in the last 5-10 years. Because it&#39;s coated in roundup. The wheat is genetically modified to be resistant to it, but we are not, so we get sick. </p>

<p>The part you bolded at the end is why this has become epidemic so recently. All the spraying right before harvest used to not be done, but now it&#39;s done more and more. </p>

<p>Problem: Glyphosate is a <em>systemic</em> herbicide - meaning that it is absorbed through leaves and other plant surfaces and enters the circulatory system of the plant, spreading from root to fruit.</p>

<p>GMO &quot;Roundup-Ready&quot; crops such as corn, soy cotton and others may receive multiple applications of glyphosate (to kill weeds) during their life cycle. The glyphosate will NOT kill the GMO crops - but it saturates all parts of the plant - including those that are used as food for humans or animals.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nutrients in farmed produce are vastly different from the nutrients in &quot;produce&quot; you can freely acquire in your local wooded areas. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally believe any kind of real &quot;collapse&quot; is imminent, as I used to. Back then, I was quite paranoid and took seriously the opinions of people who kept claiming that some kind of Apocalypse was around the corner. A person can only hear so many of these failed warnings until they finally realize it&#39;s likely all bullshit. </p>

<p>With that said, much good came from those restless nights when I wondered if I could find food next week. I became motivated in educating myself about finding food without purchasing it. I read a bunch of books on foraging for food, gardening, etc. I read about wild mushrooms, wild berries, nuts, homemade rodent traps, and so on. </p>

<p>Now, I have this hobby. I go out into the various trails and wooded areas and I have memorized many places where certain berry patches are, black walnuts trees, wild grapes, mulberry trees, apple trees, rosehip bushes, etc. I eat for free most hikes, and have memorized the fruiting seasons for many local edible plants. I also grow a lot of my herbs and make my own jelly. I get plenty of exercise and nutrition because of that paranoid delusion I used to live, so it wasn&#39;t all bad. Plus, if it wasn&#39;t a paranoid delusion and a collapse is right around the corner, I know how to take care of myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facts:</p>

<p>&quot;Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide used to kill weeds, especially annual broadleaf weeds and grasses known to compete with commercial crops grown around the globe. It was discovered to be a herbicide by Monsanto chemist John E. Franz in 1970.[3] Monsanto brought it to market in the 1970s under the trade name Roundup, and Monsanto&#39;s last commercially relevant United States patent expired in 2000.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Glyphosate&#39;s mode of action is <em>to inhibit an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids: tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine</em>. It is absorbed through foliage and translocated to growing points. Because of this mode of action, it is only effective on actively growing plants; it is not effective as a pre-emergence herbicide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Glyphosate does not bioaccumulate in mammals; it is excreted in urine and feces.[20] It breaks down variably quickly depending on the particular environment.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate</a></p>

<p>Ok, so it kills plants by blocking synthesis of three amino acids through transdermal absorption by the living plant. So what are these amino acids?</p>

<p>&quot;Tyrosine (abbreviated as Tyr or Y)[1] or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine, is one of the 22 amino acids that are used by cells to synthesize proteins.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mammals synthesize tyrosine from the essential amino acid phenylalanine (phe), which is derived from food. The conversion of phe to tyr is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of phenylalanine, such that it becomes tyrosine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In dopaminergic cells in the brain, tyrosine is converted to l-dopa by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine can then be converted into catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline).</p>

<p>The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in the colloid of the thyroid also are derived from tyrosine.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine</a></p>

<p>Key points: Tyrosine is used in the production of T3 and T4 by the thyroid. Tyrosine is synthesized from phenylalanine, which comes from food. in the brain tyrosine is converted to l-dopa by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase which is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other nerve cells.</p>

<p>&quot;Tryptophan (IUPAC-IUBMB abbreviation: Trp or W; IUPAC abbreviation: L-Trp or D-Trp; sold for medical use as Tryptan)[2] is one of the 22 standard amino acids and an essential amino acid in the human diet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For many organisms (including humans), tryptophan is an essential amino acid. This means that it is essential for human life, cannot be synthesized by the organism, and therefore must be part of our diet. Amino acids, including tryptophan, act as building blocks in protein biosynthesis. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds (see also figure to the right):</p>

<p>Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized via tryptophan hydroxylase.[10][11] Serotonin, in turn, can be converted to melatonin (a neurohormone), via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activities.[12]
Niacin is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids as key biosynthetic intermediates.[13]
Auxin (a phytohormone) when sieve tube elements undergo apoptosis.[14]&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan</a></p>

<p>Key points: Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, and humans cannot produce it. Brain chemical Serotonin is synthesized from Tryptophan, and Melatonin (which regulates sleep) from Serotonin. Niacin is also synthesized from Tryptophan.</p>

<p>&quot;Phenylalanine /ˌfɛn(ə)lˈæləˌniːn/ (abbreviated as Phe or F)[2] is an α-amino acid with the formula C6H5CH2CH(NH2)COOH. This essential amino acid is classified as nonpolar because of the hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. L-Phenylalanine (LPA) is an electrically neutral amino acid used to biochemically form proteins, coded for by DNA. The codons for L-phenylalanine are UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine signaling molecules dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the skin pigment melanin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids. L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine</a></p>

<p>Key points: Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine which  in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline) as we have previously seen.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Glyphosate&#39;s mode of action is <em>to inhibit an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids: tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine</em>. All three of these amino acids have a <em>direct link to human brain chemicals</em> Melatonin, Serotonin, Dopamine, and/or Adrenalin as well as T3/T4 Thyroxin production depending on amino acid. Traces of Glyphosate may remain on Roundup resistant crops and the exact nature of what is in GMO crops is largely unknown. US citizens since Roundup&#39;s discovery in 1970 have suffered from a number of afflictions related to sleep disorder, thyroid disorder, serotonin disorder, and general depression not recorded prior.</p>

<p>An historical example would be Edward Bernays. Sigmund Freud&#39;s nephew, Edward Bernays, the guy who convinced American women to smoke cigarettes and helped overthrow the democratically elected president of Guatemala on behalf of the United Fruit company (Chiquita), also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">helped the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) find a market for Hexafluorosilicic-acid, a byproduct of aluminum production. Working on behalf of Alcoa and various special interest groups, he successfully convinced the American public that water fluoridation was safe and beneficial to human health. This was achieved by using the American Dental Association in a highly successful media campaign.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fluoride <em>today</em> comes from fertilizer plants since it&#39;s cheaper, but it used to come from scrubbing smoke stacks at aluminum plants. </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t really what I want to concentrate on, though. First of all, any studies that had any connection to the government during that time period, especially connections to the Manhattan project, are immediately discredited due to conflicts of interest. Any studies after this that show any apparent &quot;safety&quot; of this <em>highly</em> reactive substance need to be scrutinized heavily. </p>

<p>Your point about the LD50- that has very little to do with the overall question of &quot;is this a good idea to put in water?&quot; The water in the US is typically 1-4 ppm fluoride. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9518651">2ppm fluoride damages cerebralvascular integrity.</a></p>

<p>Water is not the only source of fluoride either. You get a dose of about 1 mg from brushing 2-3 times per day. It&#39;s used on crops (see cryolite), and therefore you eat it. Similarly, a sodium fluoride residue is left on produce in food warehouses from the use of sulfuryl fluoride. You breathe it if you live near any plants that emit fluoride. Green and black tea contains 5-9 ppm. (1 ppm is the same as 1mg/L, meaning every liter of water you drink has 1 mg of fluoride)</p>

<p>5 mg per day in individuals low in iodine results in major effects on the thyroid (used to be prescribed for hyperthyroidism). At about 10 mg, it causes brain damage according to a Harvard meta-analysis of 27 studies. That is just what is provable in humans. As you can see from the rat study I cited earlier, it&#39;s much easier to prove harm using animals because of the completely controlled environment. You have to look for effects at higher doses in humans because it&#39;s harder to prove anything from all of the variables. </p>

<p>Why would 2-5 ppm affect the thyroid and brain, but 1 ppm is safe? 1 ppm still probably affects the brain and thyroid, but it&#39;s too difficult to prove. </p>

<p>Have you ever seen pictures of dental fluorosis? Why would fluoride only target the teeth? It used to be said that drinking it is how you get the tooth effects. That is no longer the case. It&#39;s admitted that fluoride has a topical effect, not systemic. Why is it still in the water? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll offer my personal opinion, although I know I will regret it. </p>

<p>The &quot;safety&quot; of fluoride was a scientific sham. This is obviously a fact going by studies when fluoride was initially proposed safe for drinking water. The &quot;safety&quot; was a lawsuit deterrent many decades ago. The nuclear arms buildup of the US would have been obviously halted had the Fluoride authorities declared it unsafe, so they had to &quot;put their money where their mouth is,&quot; so to speak. Declare it&#39;s good for children and add it to drinking water. </p>

<p>If the health establishment actually cared about the health of average Americans, they would be healthy. This is not the case. I can cite numerous examples unrelated to this discussion, but that is a waste of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assure you i am a farmer, I grow soy and corn in the midwest, I know a lot about growing said crops in the midwest.  I will allow that I do not know much about growing wheat in Canada, it&#39;s not my business, and i can also assure you that I am up to date on all chemical handling and application regulations that affect my farming operation.   That being said, the evidence you provide does not do much to further your argument which i can only assume defends description of the article referenced above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate&#39;s known properties. The <strong>common practice</strong> of desiccation and/or ripening with glyphosate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For your evidence you provide one Wikipedia page about crop dessication, and even casually reading it you can tell that whoever wrote the article has no idea what they are talking about. The article from wikipedia implies that glyphosate is used on apples, raspberries, and wine??? No one is going to spray glysophate on their apple orchard to make the fruit ripen faster, it would kill all the trees, no one is spraying it on the apples after harvest because that isn&#39;t how it works.  </p>

<p>Your next evidence is a video from AgPhd where they are talking about how dumb of an idea it is to chemically kill your crop before it&#39;s ready. Dumb idea means not common practice.</p>

<p>Lastly you post a video where a Manitoba wheat agronimist talks about what works in Manitoba.  Well maybe that&#39;s how they do it in manitoba, but it is, at best, a regional practice that is used only when the only other option is losing the crop.  </p>

<p>This brings me back to my point that this is not by any means a common farming practice, and is uncommon enough that i have never seen or heard of it being done around where I farm ever.</p>

I did notice that the article mentioned that Roundup isn&#39;t licensed to be used as a dessicant, and im sure that it is illegal to apply roundup less than 2 weeks before harvest anyways.  Also after doing a bit of reading in some farming blogs that cater to wheat farming, it sounds like it isn&#39;t very common practice at all, for the reasons I had guessed at b4, at least not in Kansas anyways.  Their estimate was that 1% of the wheat crop in the largest wheat producing state was treated with roundup in that way. As a consumer of wheat, any being treated in that way is troubling to me, and i for one wouldn&#39;t be opposed to seeing that type of practice banned, mostly because such a ban wouldn;t negatively affect my operation at all and would probably help my bottom line as it would cause a decline in planted acres and would cause a rise in commodity prices</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kudos to you for having an open mind and not ignoring evidence. What you say about it just being 1% is interesting, I had not considered that before. </p>

<p>I used to live in Kansas about 15 years ago, a couple streets away from a huge gluten-processing factory. I also have a very serious wheat allergy, as does my dad (his is not as serious). I often wonder if they&#39;re related. </p>

I am also a responsible landowner who doesn&#39;t automatically drink the kool aid that the monsanto rep is offering, but at the same time i don&#39;t drink the enviros kool aid either, not without something to back up the claims. And if i see an article with a sensational title/description about something that i do know something about, i am going to offer my opinion about it knowing that the average redditor most likely has never been to a real farm, or met a real farmer.</p>

<p>Your next evidence is a video from AgPhd where they are talking about how dumb of an idea it is to chemically kill your crop before it&#39;s ready. Dumb idea means not common practice.</p>

<p>I appreciate that you&#39;ve moved your position entirely and accept that round-up is used as a crop desiccant just prior to harvest. The part I highlighted is what I have a problem with. <em>You simply didn&#39;t watch the video and/or didn&#39;t comprehend what they said.</em> They have the opinion that crop dessication is not the best idea for seed harvest, but admit that many people do it, <strong>and</strong> mention that crop dessication is useful for many other purposes. Seed harvest is not the only reason for growing crops. Watch the 3 minute video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, my position hasn&#39;t really changed, when i originally posted my thinking was &quot;hey something about farming, and im a farmer, and ive never heard of this shit&quot; Then I did a bit more research found about shit they do outside of the cornbelt, which is admittedly not something that i have spent alot of time thinking about.  What caught my attention was the overly histrionic nature of the article that cartoonishly portrays farmers as some kind of comic book villian types scheming to pour roundup into your cheerios.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crop desiccation is real. It helps make swathing the wheat much easier, which is why they use it right before harvest. It kills the wheat, which is not GMO resistant to RoundUp, which makes harvest and post-processing easier. It&#39;s obviously bad for our health though. </p>

<p>&quot;fyi wheat isnt modified to be resistant to glysophate, gly actually kills the wheat. its used a desiccant in order to harvest quicker and not have to swath it.. im a organic farmer so im not bashing you or anything. just wanted you to have the facts. cheers&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll offer my personal opinion, although I know I will regret it. </p>

<p>The &quot;safety&quot; of fluoride was a scientific sham. This is obviously a fact going by studies when fluoride was initially proposed safe for drinking water. The &quot;safety&quot; was a lawsuit deterrent many decades ago. The nuclear arms buildup of the US would have been obviously halted had the Fluoride authorities declared it unsafe, so they had to &quot;put their money where their mouth is,&quot; so to speak. Declare it&#39;s good for children and add it to drinking water. </p>

<p>If the health establishment actually cared about the health of average Americans, they would be healthy. This is not the case. I can cite numerous examples unrelated to this discussion, but that is a waste of time.</p>
