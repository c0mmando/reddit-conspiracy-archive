       The government, on paper in an ideal world, is a tool for citizens to do more on a larger scale than they would have been able to do as independent tribes or communities.  Every action the government takes, as they are funded almost exclusively by money taken from citizens, should benefit the average person.  If a government action benefits a few, but not the vast majority, then it's not the place of government to take that action.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people are worse off with a government than they would be without one, what's the point?
      </p>
      <p>
       When did the government transition from an organization of citizens implementing beneficial large scale projects to keep society running smoothly and advancing, to a group of career politicians we hypothetically elect dictating what happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do there get to be "secret" government projects at all?  Isn't that antithetical to a government of, by, and for the people?  If a government project has to be secret from citizens, for any reason, isn't it by definition outside of the scope of government power?  The government isn't just supposed to be acting in the interests of the people, it's supposed to
       <em>
        be
       </em>
       the people, right?  How have we fostered a space for government to act in its own interest?
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't the existence of the NSA &amp; CIA directly imply that the organization we put together to deal with the gritty details of running a multimillion person society has taken over the country?  Isn't the fact that there are any government cover-ups reason enough to conclude that government has redefined their role and taken the country from the citizens?

       As soon as one government found another. Let's say tribe Ugg has met tribe Hub and they are both preparing to go to war. Everyone knows this but what tribe Hub doesnt know is that tribe Ugg has invented the sling, which if discovered could be stolen and Ugg's advantage in war would be lost.

       Well, sure, but let's talk American government. Or at least present day Western government.  There's an illusion, at the very least, that Western culture is civilized and reasonable.  The documents we're shown in school, written by the United States' founding fathers describe a government that comprised of and exists entirely to benefit the citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's only two options, right?  Either the country America is on paper has always been an illusion to mask the affairs of the elite, or at some point in the last 250 years, something has gone very wrong.

       Ok sure, I wasn't sure whether you meant government in general or specifics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that western, like eastern culture is broadly civilised and reasonable. In the west you generally have freedom of expression, religion etc

       Im not American but I have read a little bit about the American revolution, namely that only about 1/3 of americans actually wanted the British out and it was one of the very few wars France had ever won against the British.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is much like Rome, founded as a 'democracy' but really just having a relatively small number of very wealthy families be the main politicians (with some exceptions of course) but the core of American politics is money. You cannot get anywhere without millions. My main problem with US politics is that they are 1 party off of a one party system (I.e a dictatorship)

       People accept that for a free market to function we all have to have access to the real data as fast as possible. In fact you get put in jail if you try to act on information that hasn't yet been distributed to the public. Somehow people seem to think it's different for a democracy though.

       If we're expected to make decisions we need to know the truth, otherwise we're just being led to the slaughter.

       It's probably been present in one form or another forever. And I think people were a lot more willing to accept what they were told at face value because they had no other way of verifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, today you'd think that secrecy would be gone due to the information age, but what it's really done is make government double down on their lying and disinfo so people don't know how or where to find the truth.

       Information is a two way street.  They get the NSA, we get the Snowden leaks.  They get to secretly torture, we get immediate access to a PDF of every released report.  This stuff doesn't have to pass through the filter of TV anymore, and people don't have to go searching in libraries to read declassified documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if it's possible that the growing lack of privacy will backfire on the people trying to take it away. I imagine the government thinks so, or it wouldn't be trying so hard to regulate the internet.

       This is well worded, thanks OP.

       My opinion is that the above doesn't describe government as a whole, but specifically a democratic government. That's where the big issue lies - they teach us we live in a democracy, when it's quite far from.

       Maybe it's good fortune that we're taught this is a democracy.  We've got a generation or two of people who want to hold our government to the promises they made on paper, and have greater access than ever before to the knowledge that the reality is pretty far from the promise.

       Wow, interesting point. I agree partially... We don't know what would happen if those 2 generations were actually taught the truth... Things aren't so bad yet in terms of freedoms and laws (compared to other countries), so maybe they would take it upon themselves to make change while it's still possible.
