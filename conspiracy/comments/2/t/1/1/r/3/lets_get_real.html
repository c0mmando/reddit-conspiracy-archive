<p>Remember that. What&#39;s the first emotion you get when you have a cop behind you? Or when you do your taxes? You cant simply shift fear.</p>

<p>That is what control really is here in america. We have been shown time and time again that we as citizens are not held in any way but suspects by those that have authority.  Not just police either. They are honestly least of the problem its other citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is all thruout our system of government from local to the Whitehouse.  At some point in our history fear of police became a thing. I wish I knew when that happened. </p>

<p>It was then that we as citizens lost power. That is why I say it isnt the police.  Really the fault lies with ourselves.  Other fear losing something and with powers given to the police thru legislation that we approved as voters we gave our control over.</p>

<p>Personally I dont dislike police. I dislike their chosen laws to enforce for revenue, but I really dont think that is their choice. Its a job like any other in theory. They do as they are instructed.  The cities they police are in need of revenue so they are told to issue tickets. Now the forfeiture shit is by choice in most places. </p>

<p>I have been watching cops recently and the amount of things I see where they just fuck people over like this kind that had no record going home from work. He got pulled over for speeding. The cop asked to search his car and he had a small bag of weed. The cop arrested him and acted like he got a goddamn cartel leader off the street.</p>

<p>Its pathetic. He fucked that kids life forever now.  Yeah ok he broke the law but in reality that cop could have looked the other way. They are tought to be this way and that is why we need civilian oversight. </p>

<p>We have cops out there that are still on the force that have killed multiple citizens and been justified in doing so, but when you kill someone it does change you. They need to be taken out of the role of a police officer I think. Career is done. </p>

<p>Its been brought to the attention that they are recruiting people of lower then average intelligence to become officers and rejecting those that have higher. I dont know if this is true, but it does seem legitimate.  I mean its evident when they dont think for themself any further then resolving a conflict with lethal force. </p>

<p>When you walk up to a stop and the cop has their hand on their gun it shows they have no reservations in killing you. It seems they dont want to try and resolve it by other means its just kill a person. </p>

<p>Now maybe its my tin foil hat reading to much into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well if people weren&#39;t afraid of police before the Kent State riots and everything else that went on during the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, that&#39;s probably around when it happened.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t dislike the police either generally speaking, in fact I have an uncle and a few friends who are police themselves and I think that <em>most</em> police are just normal people like the rest of us trying to make a living and not abusing their power.  But the problem comes about because of <em>how much power</em> police have to abuse if they choose to do so - they have near unilateral authority in most jurisdictions to pretty much do whatever they want, even up to and including blatant physical assault and even murder in some cases.  And then add to that the increasingly powerful weapons they&#39;re given as well as the fact that many are recruited after returning from the war and only those of mediocre/below average intelligence are considered for most positions.</p>

<p>I live in NYC and recently the NYPD did this weird thing where they stopped issuing so many tickets and random arrests apparently in &quot;protest&quot; against the city for how it handled those police deaths from a month ago.  Miraculously, the city went on perfectly fine without them.  There was no anarchy, no looting in the streets, just less police presence and less bullshit fines being handed out.</p>

<p>It is true, although it&#39;s not a universal rule and doesn&#39;t take place in every state/county/jurisdiction.  Still scary though for sure - I know of someone who was turned away from the academy and found out later that it was because he scored too high on the test along with being too well educated/having too high of a GPA in college.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t, it&#39;s a huge problem although unfortunately it&#39;s just one of (very) many that we as a country and world currently face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is, of course, unless those investors are so extremely knowledgable that they know they are propping up the dollar, and will bail just before it comes back down, in order to make a massive amount of profit. It happened in 2008, it happens in the 30&#39;s, and it will happen again. </p>

<p>This economy we have adopted is incredibly irresponsible. It is unsustainable, and when time runs out it all must come back down. A debt/credit economy onky works in moderation, as you pointed out. This means using debt/credit when needed, not used for gains or profit nor abused for economical advancement. </p>

<p>Other countries lend to america because of the petrodollar status, and the fsct that it is currently the worlds reserve currency. This stands only for as long as america can make good on its interests, and the rate we are going, we wont be able to pay down the interests applied to our debt, let alone tackle the debt head-on. This point of no return might not happen for awhile, yet. But does this mean we continue on being wreckless? No. It means we still have time to reconsider our irresponsible ways that make the rich richer and the poor poorer, particularily when shit comes back down.</p>

<p>where will they bail out TO ? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats a very good question, to be honest. I do not know. The thing is, the world economy seems to be hurting all over the place. This can explain why the dollar is going up, because it is all relative to the world economy, and everyone else seems to be doing worse than the dollar. But this doesnt explicitly mean that the dollar is doing good. </p>

<p>Ill admit, im not incredibly knowledgable in this area. But it seems to me that our debt is so incredibly high and ever-increasing, that point of no return, in which we could no longer afford even the interest payments, will come soon enough. </p>

<p>I feel like this discussion warrants its own thread. This would allow a more fair debate on this topic, for you, and for me, and for any other members of this sub interested in this topic. </p>

<p>I cant tell, yet, your depth of knowledge in this field, but i have a feeling you might be a bit more knowledgable than me (i can admit these things.) Ill submit a post about this, and see what all of us can come up with together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve come to understand most since joining this sub is that TPTB believe highly in energy and rituals, so in my logic, that means LOVE has power. I&#39;m working on learning to love myself (better thoughts and actions towards myself), be a better neighbor and part of my community, and to practice random acts of kindness. </p>

<p>But our true reality is the little world we live in. Feels like shit that my family is so fractured and broken, but I don&#39;t know how to fix that, with people resistant to truth or personal accountability. But I finally stopped playing out that dynamic in all my relationships. I can&#39;t heal my family, but I can help my friends and community. When the SHTF, it&#39;s not going to matter if I researched the CFR or FBI files, it&#39;s going to be the personal relationships and resources that I&#39;ve developed within 5 square miles. </p>

<p>At times, coming here, filling myself with anxiety and dissatisfaction feels EXTREMELY counterproductive. But, I&#39;ve also found a shit ton of explanations. Understanding some of the symbolism helps keep my waters from being muddled. I don&#39;t view news as reality that affects me anymore, rather a scripted cipher. I&#39;ve looked at my own spending habits and consumerism, especially media. I go back in forth with reading or posting here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying you&#39;re saying this, but I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s important to &quot;focus on the positive&quot; at the expense of the negative on this planet.  Part of the reason why there is so much focus on the negative in the first place here is because there is SO MUCH OF IT to begin with.  This world is almost overrunning with it.  It&#39;s no surprise that so many of us in this sub think about it and talk about it so often.  There&#39;s TONS of it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s important to absolutely be aware of all the negative here - cuz there is certainly lots, and trying to deny any of it is simply an extremely ignorant, dangerous thing to do.  I think it&#39;s also important to realize that there <em>is</em> positivity too, however, and be aware of the fact that the dark would not exist without the light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People in every time in history have always said &quot;geez, it&#39;s worse now than it&#39;s EVER been, we can&#39;t go on like this, it&#39;s all about to collapse&quot;.  And somehow we go on, and it doesn&#39;t collapse (unless it is the Mongol horde at the gates of the city).</p>

<p>Perhaps things seem really bad right now because a) you and I are living right now and talking about it right now, and b) worldwide communications are the best they&#39;ve ever been, right now.  We hear and see every bad thing that happens.</p>

<p>Are things worse now than they were during the Black Plague ?  Worse than during WW I or WW II ?  In USA, worse than they were during Civil War or Great Depression ?  No.</p>
