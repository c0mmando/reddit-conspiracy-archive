      <p>
       I notice that this topic is discussed in a very naive way by most of Reddit, on both sides of the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-Vaxxers will usually focus on the safety of vaccines and diseases/illnesses they are linked with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro-Vaxxers will usually bring up the Dr Wakefield "vaccines cause Autism" Strawman, and claim that those who choose not to vaccinate are endangering others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think both sides are not understanding the issue in its proper context.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Council on Foreign Relations and the entities they influence are
       <a href="http://www.cfr.org/interactives/GH_Vaccine_Map/">
        currently attempting to push the idea that vaccines should be mandatory for the entire population
       </a>
       , and it's working - at least here on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mandatory Vaccines WILL become a reality. At the current rate - it is only a matter of time before public opinion shifts enough to allow it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of where you stand on the issue (personally, I'm vaccinated, but strongly against mandatory vaccination), I think it's important to frame the discussion around the most important point - that giving the state the power to force injections on individuals against their consent (and this will realistically happen when unvaccinated individuals start getting treated like second class citizens and refused entry into schools), is incredibly foolish, considering how objectively immoral and abusive the government has shown itself to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you are not a conspiracy theorist, the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">
        list of abuses involving medicine and experiments
       </a>
       that the state freely admits to is absolutely horrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a short quote from the wiki article.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The experiments include: the deliberate infection of people with deadly or debilitating diseases, exposure of people to biological and chemical weapons, human radiation experiments, injection of people with toxic and radioactive chemicals, surgical experiments, interrogation and torture experiments, tests involving mind-altering substances, and a wide variety of others. Many of these tests were performed on children,[1] the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of "medical treatment". In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities or prisoners."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How can any reasonable person trust an entity which has been, and continues to be responsible for such crimes, with power over their own body and physical well-being?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we know this power would not be abused in future?
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to refuse vaccines (or any medical treatment, for
       <strong>
        any
       </strong>
       reason), without fear of legal repercussions or discrimination is a fundamental human right, and a very important one for preventing abuse by governments against their people (of which there are many examples of, e.g the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_abuse_of_psychiatry_in_the_Soviet_Union">
        Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If you do not have sovereign ownership over your own body, you can not claim to be free.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Amusingly the arguments in the comment section fully support my point. People arguing the same old arguments while missing the bigger picture I mentioned.

       Okay, I just read one of those threads, and it was pretty chilling. The hate, ignorance, and basic lack of scientific knowledge among those chanting "science science" is astounding.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing for us to remember is this: Reddit is not the real world. Reddit is highly, highly "gamed" by corporate and government interests. Keep talking reason with people you know in the real world. Keep sharing information with people you know in the real world. And the more people you can get to send a letter to their congresscritter asking for accountability for pharmafuckups and more public funding for scientific research, the better. I don't trust the government, and for sure, there's a revolving door at CDC, FDA, and so on, but I trust our drunk and clueless congressional crooks a little bit more than anyone who'd spend money to encourage death threats on Reddit for the almost imaginary minority of people who are totally against vaccines in order to deflect from their own culpability in disease outbreaks.

       <em>

       Sort by controversial or new in a lot of threads that are highly upvoted and then, also go hang out with different groups of people in the real world and talk with them a bit - not just fellow students, but family, people in the bar, people at work, etc. It's illuminating.

       Took me awhile - but here's a mainstream thread about vax vs. anti-vax stuff where normal, rational people are discussing vaccination and haven't yet been overrun by shilliciousness:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/2u13yt/jail_antivax_parents_your_right_to_be_sick_ends/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/2u13yt/jail_antivax_parents_your_right_to_be_sick_ends/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You still see a lot of rational comments in vaccine threads, but they quickly become overrun. Pharmabots haven't found that thread yet, it looks like.

       In addition, any personal testimonies are dismissed as anomalies and bullshit. I developed a medical condition, after receiving both the HPV series and the H1N1 flu vaccine. Previous diagnostic tests had determined that I didn't have it, because my half sister did, and I constantly asked about testing and symptoms. I've spoken with other women online, who developed the same condition, after the HPV series. Are our experiences recorded and reported by the medical community? Are we included in statistics? Are we dismissed as hysterical women that don't understand science?

       Yep. Why are so many women so alt-med? Because we go to the doctor for legit serious issues and get told we're crazy, take a crazy pill. Report dangerous side effects from a medication, "That's just not possible." Two years later, what warnings are we seeing on the label? And what ads from lawyers for? Mmmhmmm. But little good it does us once damage is done. :(
      </p>
      <p>
       In doctors' defense, though, this has also recently happened to a few men I know. So we're getting to peak equal opportunity "You're crazy, that's just not possible, take a chill pill." Lots of good docs out there, though, just hard to find 'em and they're retiring or moving practices under hospitals fast.

       The funny thing is that the whole propaganda push appears to be just to hide pharmaceutical companies' own culpability in the recent outbreaks. But why let a good propaganda push go to waste? It's working for cyber and surveillance, why not for big-med...

       Good luck OP. Big Pharma has the net crawling with trolls and the inherently brainwashed. YOU guys can go get all the shots you want from these SCUM Big Pharma companies.

       It boggles my mind how all these people GET MAD and attack people who don't get vaccines from Corrupt Corporations which have literally committed dozens of crimes and been convicted of these crimes.

       “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum....”

       ― Noam Chomsky, The Common Good

      <p>
       Debate framing is one of the strongest forces of propaganda, and the framing of many debates in the MSM deflects the discussion away from realistic problem solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the framing of the "climate change debate" is one of them. The debate isn't about "climate change" it's about
       <em>
        pollution
       </em>
       and accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GMO debate also seems to be framed into two categories of "
       <em>
        ALL
       </em>
       GMOs are good" or "
       <em>
        ALL
       </em>
       GMOs are bad". Anyone with a capacity to think critically could tell that both of these positions are inherently false.

       The other aspect of the discussion is how incredibly dumbed down the Pro-Vaxxers argument is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody defines what it means to be "vaccinated". Vaccinated against WHAT?  They act has if there is just one single vaccine out there to protect you against all diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are dozens and dozens of diseases out there that have vaccinations. But WHO exactly determines what diseases you are at risk for? Not all diseases attack the same way. Factors such has geographic location, age, genetics, and dietary health play into your chances or even ability at all to get a particular disease. Also, behavior plays a massive role, such as cleanliness, whether you touch your eyes after touching surfaces, etc. Don't forget many diseases change over time, some change every year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you're vaccinated for one flu strain this year doesn't mean you'll be protected against a different flu strain that same year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should everyone in the world receive a malaria vaccine? What about the dozens of flu vaccines, should we get all of them every year?  Polio? Small pox? Measles? Anthrax? Mumps? Monkey pox? Chicken pox? Yellow fever? Etc., etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       WHO decides this mandatory requirement?
      </p>
      <p>
       WHO pays for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       WHO is held accountable when a vaccine causes detrimental/fatal consequences?

       The 14th amendment turned your rights into privileges, by creating a new citizenship, the US citizen. It is through implied consent do they own you. I have a post that shows you how to reclaim your rights, but you are not free right now if you haven't enunciated your US citizenship and retained you state"s citizenship, and claimed right to retain residence. Here is the passage.
      </p>
      <p>
       This loophole was 15 States at Large, Chapter 249 (Section 1), enacted July 27, 1868, one day before the 14th Amendment was declared "ratified". You will not see this statute published anywhere except in very old books. The Conspirators do not want their "citizens" to know it exists, and it has never been repealed. The text follows:
Whereas the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and whereas in the recognition of this principle this government has freely received emigrants from all nations, and invested them with the rights of citizenship; and whereas it is claimed that such American citizens, with their descendants, are subjects of foreign states, owing allegiance to the governments thereof; and whereas it is necessary to the maintenance of public peace that this claim of foreign allegiance should be promptly and finally disavowed: Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That any declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officers of this government which denies, restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation, is hereby declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this government.

       It's all fear-mongering.

      <p>
       "If you/your kids don't get vaccinated, you'll hurt me/my kids! Therefore I have every reason to bully you into compliance and tell you you're stupid if you disagree! The science is irrefutable! (Never mind whether or not I've actually read any studies on the subject myself, or have any sources for you to educate yourself with - you don't need any of that, you just have to -believe!-)"
      </p>
      <p>
       And on the other side:
      </p>
      <p>
       "If people don't believe that vaccines are harmful enough that they would fight for the right to not inject them/their child with them, they won't fight for -my- right to not inject myself/my child with vaccines. I have every reason to tell people that vaccines are horrible - to do otherwise would be dangerous to -me-! Let's see if I can dig up some sources that coincide with what I already believe to be true for people to read..."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I've seen anyone calling for vaccinations to be made illegal, so apparently "anti-vaxxers" seem to think it's ok for other parents to make their own choices in how they raise their children. However, "pro-vaxxers" don't seem to want to extend the same courtesy, and will make comments like how anyone who doesn't vaccinate should have their children taken away and things like that. Of course, "parents shouldn't have the right to raise their own children (except
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       in circumstances XYZ)" is a pretty popular theme in general (
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2tf0y4/cmv_parents_who_want_to_conceive_should_have_to/">
        for example, these sorts of CMV threads
       </a>
       ), so maybe people are just anti-parent more so than pro-vaccine?

       All parents are making decisions about their children's bodies and are desperately worried they are making the wrong decisions--on all sides (by the way, opt-out rates for vaccination are less than 3%, so you guys are wasting a lot of manpower falling for pharmapropaganda and shrieking like little banshees).
      </p>
      <p>
       When parents seek further information about vaccination and other health-related issues, especially here on Reddit (probably no one does this, because what the hell) they get shrieking harpies calling them baby murderers in the most grammatically backwards herfderf language ever instead of actual information conveyed by rational, intelligent fellow adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to understand that this makes everyone more suspicious and does not increase their comfort level. If you cannot have empathy for all parents in that situation, I just don't know.

       I have 2 very close family members who nearly died from vaccinations.  One from encephalitic brain fever from MMR (a common side-effect) that required immediate hospitalization, and another who was in a hospital for nearly a year due to major paralysis (most likely Guillain-Barre syndrome) from a flu shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand my moral dilemna?  I've spent years researching vaccinations, the evidence is.. contradictory, to say the least.  In most cases, the precautionary principle would apply here, those who seek to push these innoculations on us have the burden of providing absolute proof.  As long as there is a profit incentive behind vaccines, how can we trust them?  It's been proven time and time again that governments and corporations will lie, cheat, and injure people for the sake of profit, how is this any different?

       Sure, I have lots.  I want to preface this by saying I'm not against vaccines in principle.  From what I have researched, there are definitely some vaccines that are fairly safe and effective.  Where do I begin?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://benswann.com/truth-in-media-vaccine-court-and-autism/">
        Here is a great report by Ben Swann on the creation of the National Childhood Vaccination Information Act
       </a>
       .  It completely insulated vaccine manufacturers from litigation.  All injury claims must now go through the VICP, a "court" that decides whether one has enough evidence to prove vaccine induced injury.  One of the main problems is they throw out cases based on a presupposition that the injury couldn't have been caused by a vaccine based on current data.  Recently they threw out over 5000 cases of autistic regression from vaccines based on an omnibus autism proceeding that deemed "they didn't believe there was evidence linking vaccines to autism."  The people are powerless, they can't build legal precedence against a manufacturer and it is very hard to bring possible new injuries to light because of preconceived notions.  The whole thing wreaks of bureaucracy and corporate influence.  DESPITE ALL THIS, the vaccine court has now awarded compensation to over 200 cases of children suffering encephalopathy (a fairly common vaccine injury) leading to an autistic spectrum disorder diagnosis!  Tell this to any idiot who claims there is no link to autism; there certainly is a link!  These people had to provide such an overwhelming amount of evidence that the court had no choice but to compensate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alright, secondly: flu shots, the worst culprit of them all.  I always wondered why flu shots are pushed so hard despite their ineffectiveness, then I found out that they make about 10x as much money as all other vaccines combined! They are the cash cow.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFPVviqOJ6Q">
        Here is a great talk by a PhD geneticist with over 150 published studies to his name on the ineffectiveness of flu shots
       </a>
       .

       Have you heard of the Canadian Problem?  Initial data on the H1N1 "pandemic" a few years ago seemed to find that people in Canada who received the seasonal flu shot were more susceptible to, and suffered worse symptoms from the H1N1 virus.  Dr. Danuta Skowronski, lead epidemiologist at the BC centre for disease control,
       <a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ICAAC/34674">
        performed a double-blind, placebo controlled study on ferrets to see if the initial data was replicated, AND IT WAS!
       </a>
       A rarely spoken of effect of some disease strains is infection can actually make you MORE susceptible to other strains.  This may be the case here, or it could be that people who actually got the flu that year developed stronger antibodies to H1N1 than the flu shots provide.  It is well known knowledge that most vaccines offer only temporary incomplete immunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       One vaccine that offers some of the least effective immunity is the whooping cough vax, DTaP.
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22970945">
        Scientists found that every year after vaccination, the odds of catching whooping cough increased by 42%
       </a>
       , meaning after 5 years a vaccinated person is no more protected than unvaccinated.  The largest major outbreak of whooping cough in America affected a population that was around 90% vaccinated.  Now this brings me to the second problem with DTaP:
       <a href="http://www.cidd.psu.edu/research/synopses/acellular-vaccine-enhancement-b.-parapertussis">
        DTaP vaccination ENHANCES b. Parapertussis colonization by 40,000 times!
       </a>
       Parapertussis is another strain of whooping cough, though not as symptomatic as Pertussis.  The vaccine actually greatly increases your chance of getting and spreading whooping cough!  This comes back to the dynamic I was discussing before: being infected with some strains of virus can make you more susceptible to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads me to my last main point: some inoculations can actually make you a vector for the spread of the virus!
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1679866">
        Here is a study done on an outbreak that occurred right after mass Polio vaccination with the OPV vaccination
       </a>
       .  An important thing to note: the OPV polio vaccination is a live-virus vaccination, and it is banned in every major first world country.  Guess why?  Because it actually increases the risk of Polio.  Now instead of destroying this trash what have they done? Universally pawned it off on the third world.  There are hundreds of reported Polio outbreaks that occur right after a mass vaccination.  The whole "India is now Polio free!" situation?  It's bullshit! To understand this I have to get into the history of Polio vaccination.  Long story short, Polio is actually a host of separate syndromes.  Polio eradication in the first world was more of a "reclassification" of the disease.  Now instead of Polio we have new, symptomatically identical conditions such as asceptic meningitis, and non-polio accute flaccid paralysis.  While it is true that the new polio vaccine in the first world is effective and Polio is very rare here, the disease we knew as Polio in the 1940's is not completely eradicated.  Now, back to India.  Despite the fact that "Polio" has been eradicated,
       <a href="http://www.webmedcentralplus.com/article_view/35">
        rates of NPAFP have skyrocketed!
       </a>
       Not only this, but risk of NPAFP is directly correlated to the amount of OPV shots received!  if this isn't a smoking gun, then I don't know what is.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a few more important things to note about vaccines, such as: the varicella, or chicken pox, vaccine is tied to a huge increase in shingles cases.  Shingles is a caused by the same virus as chicken pox which gets reactivated later in life.  It is a FAR more debilitating condition than chicken pox.  There is some debate over what exactly is happening here, obvious shill publications are giving the same ludicrous excuse as they do with cancer "the higher incidence is because people live longer."  This is stupid, because the varicella vaccine was introduced in 1995 and people don't live all that much longer than they did in 1995.  The rise in shingles is also strongly correlative with varicella vaccination rates.  Some scientists have posited that when old people are around children with the virus, it acts as a "booster" to keep shingles at bay, now that chickenpox vaccination has greatly reduced the incidence of the virus, the older generations are no longer exposed to this booster.
      </p>
      <p>
       The root of all these issues is the fact that the pharmaceutical companies that push vaccines are greedy, corrupt institutions that consistently demonstrate that they put profit over human health (legally prescribed drugs kill more people than car accidents).  They constantly push the false dichotomy of vaccine=science, skepticism=babykiller!  They have been very good at conditioning the average person to not dare question vaccines.  This means they don't have to invest in newer safer vaccines, they don't have to compensate injuries, and they can continue making insane profits from dangerous, outdated products.  The reality is the tide of public opinion can very easily turn against them if their propaganda/political influence machine slips up, this is why the topic of vaccination is probably the most heavily shilled subject in media today.  It is the health of our children we're talking about.  Always remember, the situation isn't black and white like they try to frame it, it isn't anti-vax vs pro-vax.  This is about demanding accountability from these companies, and forcing them to invest in better, safer vaccine technology.

       I had always dismissed anti-vax arguments. Having worked in the NHS, I just assumed that the was good data supporting any treatment which was offered. Ususally this is the case, NICE (the national institute for clinical excellence) collate evidence, publish their findings, and if something is shown to be cost-effective, you can get it on the NHS. In the case of most vaccinations this is true. For the influenza vaccine, I was absolutely shocked. Here is the link to the (lack of) evidence that NICE has found for the flu jab:

       TLDR: No or insufficient evidence of benefit in the following populations: Healthy adults, those aged 65+ (this is particularly important, as millions gets spent every year to vaccinate this group), asthmatics, people suffering from bronchiectasis, sufferers of cystic fibrosis, people with cardiovascular disease, diabetics, CKD sufferers, people with immunosuppression, health and social care workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is weak evidence for a benefit to healthy children, and good evidence for people with COPD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thre reasson so many of the above groups are vaccinated every year is because it is department of health policy, not because it has shown to be cost effective or beneficial to the public. Considering the amount of money spent on them, that's pretty staggering.

       , essentially what it says is that the reason we catch infections, viral or bacterial, is because we make our biological terrain favorable to infections, by moving the ph and orp parameters of our tissue through poor diet (in particular chlorinated water, or coke, makes our tissue oxidant, which favor virii). Vaccines are mere band-aid over the wider issue of our diet, when they even work that is... breatharians might not be as stupid as you might think, but please carry on eating your food from your perceived intellectual and moral superiority, meanwhile i'll just carry on not getting sick ever.

       Edit: No I won't be nicer about thjs. There is absolutely no justification behind the anti-vaccer movement at all. None. At. All. I looked, because I am a conspiracy buff. And there is nothing at all there except willful ignorance, which is only comparable to creationists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah it needs to be reframed in that anti-vaccers should read a fucking book. The only person in this debate who lied to make money is the guy who posted the initial paper that started this shit storm. He's been disbarred, his medical license revoked, and detailed point by point examples of where he fabricated evidence are freely available.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing that has spurred this phenomenon is people not knowing the difference between correlation and causation. Children are immunized at he same point in their lives that symptoms of autism start to get expressed. That's where the sob story videos from parents with autistic children come from.

      <p>
       The only thing that needs to change is for people to get more pissed off about this fucking retarded phenomenon.

       A little while back on conspiracy a link was posted from a whistleblower. THOUSANDS if PRIVATE INTERNAL PAPERS FROM THE FDA!!!! OMG WE HAVE PROOF THEYTE COVERING SHIT UP. What came of it? Absolutely fucking nothing. Because there's nothing there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mercury levels never went of FDA recommended levels. They did start to get close for the day when a baby received all their lifesaving disease-erraticating vaccinations due to a preservative called thimerasol. So the FDA asked drug companies to phase out the use of this preservative. And they gave. Almost completely. For years.
      </p>

       There is nothing redeemable about the anti-vacc movement at all, and you're a fucking moron who needs to read an actual scientific article if you think otherwise.

       If anti-science people would take the time to learn the massive amount of data supporting the safety of vaccines enough people would get vaccinated by their own accord and herd immunity would be strong enough to keep these diseases from spreading and there would be no talk of mandatory injections. Unfortunately because so many people think fearmongering blogs and former Playboy models are just as credible as decades of proven scientific research, discussions about making the vaccinations mandatory are starting to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, this push is a response to people being stupid. If they weren't so stupid, no one would be worried about it. The fact is, the anti-vax movement is responsible for the resurgence of diseases that haven't been an issue in decades. This is a matter of public safety, and your choices don't exist in a vaccuum. If you refuse the vaccine you become a potential carrier and run the risk of infecting others, including those who cannot be vaccinated. If you'd like to keep your right to refuse, you should be helping to increase scientific literacy before the ignorant force law-makers into making mandatory vaccinations a reality in order to ensure public safety.

       This is exactly the type of comment I have been trying to reason against on this site for years.  No hard facts, no sources, no science; just strawmen arguments, and ad hominem attacks on the "intelligence" of celebrity anti-vaccers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not against the idea of vaccines at all, the problem lies with the companies manufacturing them.  They are, literally, the most corrupt corporations on this planet.  GSK, a prominent manufacturer, is currently being sued by the US government for $3 billion dollars for massive bribery and corruption charges.  The simple fact of the matter is: as long as there is a profit motive behind vaccines, they simply cannot be trusted to be as safe and effective as they claim.  Merck is currently being sued by two of its scientists for being forced to fake the efficacy of their mumps vaccine.  And, as we all know, the CDC is in on all of this criminal behaviour, as demonstrated by the whistleblower statements made last year by one of their top scientists: Dr. William Thompson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you trust an oil company to tell you the truth about Climate change and pollution?  Would you trust a fracking company to tell you the truth about fracking wastewater?  Then why the fuck do you trust a pharmaceutical company to tell you the truth about vaccines?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you open to reason?  Would you believe I can pull up dozens of studies showing vaccine efficacy is NOT what it's touted to be? Studies proving that in some cases a vaccine can make you more susceptible to a disease?  Or that vaccinated people can actually act as a vector for the transmission of the disease? Do you know anything about the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program?  Or how it is simply impossible to sue a manufacturer for vaccine injury, thus it is nearly impossible for legal precedent to be made proving a vaccine is unsafe?  Did you know the ethylmercury contained in thimerosal, still used in flu shots and some vaccines, deposits twice as much inorganic mercury in the brain as it's more feared sibling: methylmercury?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're open to reason I can post some scientific material to back up my claims, but years of talking to you people has shown me that trying to convince a rabid pro-vaccer of vaccine dangers is akin to trying to convince a creationist that evolution exists.

       You understand that Vaccines are backed by actual evidence right? Like massive, gigantic quantities of evidence supported by every expert in the world. See, science is required in order to pass these vaccines, and the data is reviewed by hundreds of independent academic organizations. I am not trusting a corporation... I am trusting a tried and true process that literally saves millions of lives a year.

       Vaccines have an extremely small chance of producing ill effects in the people infected. But, considering the odds of it happening compared to the risks of not vaccinating, vaccines are still highly recommended. The program exists to help those who experience side effects. It is about weighing the costs and the benefits.

      <p>
       Themerosal is only used in flu vaccines now. There is copious research to show that it has no effect. (

        If you're open to reason I can post some scientific material to back up my claims, but years of talking to you people has shown me that trying to convince a rabid pro-vaccer of vaccine dangers is akin to trying to convince a creationist that evolution exists.

      <p>
       Funny, considering I would say the opposite. I know exactly what you'll do. You will post some scholarly articles that NaturalNews or some other bullshit blog told you prove that vaccines are bad! you will of course ignore the fucking massive quantity of scientific studies that go against your opinion. Seriously, here is an overview of all the studies that looked at the link between autism and vaccines:

       Ugh, someone has been reading his/her "alternative" blogs. Did you bother to check the facts on those articles?

      <p>
       I am assume you are talking about Mr. William Thompson. If you are referring to another instance, please let me know.

      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you bother to look up Mr. Thompson's statements after this story broke?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/">
        http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       See, in his statement, he says things like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue  to save countless lives.  I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated  with their administration are vastly outweighed  by their individual and societal benefits.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here is his rationale for his concern:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My concern has been the decision to omit relevant findings in a particular study for a particular sub­ group for a particular  vaccine. There have always been recognized risks for vaccination and I believe it is the responsibility of the CDC to properly  convey the risks associated  with receipt of those vaccines.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The study by no means found massive increased chances of autism. Considering the rate at which it occurs, the findings are relatively small. But, like a responsible scientist, Mr. Thompson felt it was the CDC's responsibility to report it. I agree with his opinion. Findings, no matter how small, should be allowed to be seen by the public. As Mr. Thompson indicates, his words were blown out of proportion by people with an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know people here like to rage about how bad the MSM is, but alternative media is just as bad, likely worse. At least in mainstream media, their viewership/readership is large and broad enough and they exist in an arena with enough competition that outright lies are often caught. On the flip side, your "alternative" media sites have no motivation to point any skeptical eye on themselves. Their conspiracy oriented readership will eat that shit up as long as it tells them what they want to hear.

       I never said anything about vaccines and autism. I was discussing the fact that MMR and DTAP aren't as effective in their current incarnation, causing these outbreaks. That we need new and better vaccines - Merck was effectively blocking the market for new research because of their false claims of efficacy.

       Why do you have an issue with less than 3% of the population? It's higher for flu, but flu shot is a whole different can of wax - even health providers have started warning people off on those, there's a really interesting article by a doc in Scotland who has actually had her staff stop doing them after analyzing their effectiveness and usefulness.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Tip to many: Are you having panic attacks or weird dizzy spells suddenly after being worn down? It may just be viral nerve damage. You can get this from the flu itself, from chicken pox, from any number of virii, and from FluMist. It's called neuritis. You aren't crazy no matter what your doc tells you--don't take antidepressants--just take care of yourself and you will get better!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you have an issue with Merck, who lied about the efficacy of MMR, thereby scaring people off vaccines, causing more outbreaks, and blocking the government from funding better research because they can't justify replacing a vaccine that they've been told is 95% effective?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you care so much about saving people and getting people vaccinated, why are you spending time calling less than 3% of the population stupid and more time researching for yourself? Finding out what the issues actually are, how to make them better, so that vaccines are safer and more effective?
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling people names on the Internet doesn't make vaccines safer and more effective, and it doesn't make people go get vaccinated. It frankly makes them distrust you and the medical establishment, and undermines whatever cause you think you're championing.

       Don't fucking accuse me of not researching. I've been familiar with every single point in every single post. Your completely transparent attempts at attacking my character and assuming my opinions while pretending to take the high road are getting obnoxious.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who choose not to get vaccinated are ignorant of the science. Plain and simple. Are there issues that may arise with drug companies or vaccine effectiveness? Of course... and these should be researched and improvements should be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact remains that the vast majority of data supports vaccinations and there is plenty of data to support the claims that diseases are being spread because of opt-outs. Sorry I came on too emotional for your liking in my initial response, but rabid science denial pisses me off.

       We aren't getting anywhere, and I'm regretting ever responding to this thread. I would say something regarding your point of view, but you havent really even made that clear. Lets just a agree to disagree and you can continue vaccinating or not vaccinating or whatever it is you do.

       Are you aware of just how vast the science on any given vaccine is? I'm generalizing because the relevant ones to what we are discussing (the ones administered on a large public scale) are very, very, very well researched. You can nitpick and find little problems with corporations or issues here and there, but the science is vast and uniform.

       Also, work on your "but herd immunity means we need 99.9999!" parroting. Measles was pretty much eradicated until we switched vaccine types. Guaranfuckingtee we had more opt-outs in the 70s and 80s than now.

       We point-blank need a new vaccine, Merck doesn't want to admit in public that their vaccine has issues (many reasons for this, but one is due to the pending lawsuits alleging that they passed off fraudulent data and hid trial data), and you kids are falling for the distraction--beating up on scared parents worried about their kids instead of going after the real target - we need better research, further decoupled from moneyed interests whose only true obligation is to shareholders.

       Most of the claims in that article are already discussed in the last article I discussed, and the rest are unproven assertions made by proven fraud, Andrew Wakefield. For god's sake, read something that isn't telling you what you want to hear. When you see an article like this, google what they are telling you, see what other sources have to say on the matter.

       More importantly, learn what scientists have done to investigate claims linking to autism and what they found. The amount of studies conducted that found no correlation is fucking insane.

       Alternative blogs, lol. Where are your empirical studies, the use of news articles and other websites are not valid sources. Your just following the propaganda mainstream pushes. If you would listen to OP all of this information is out there. In order to understand both sides you have to look at scientific evidence from "both sides" I.E research from empirical studies and truly understand the issue. Not online news articles, We all know of the bias in the media. I agree with some of your points but without proper empirical evidence, you're just spouting your opinion.

       I don't think the argument is whether vaccines are affect or not, but the choice to receive them. With these freedoms stripped we just move towards a dystopian future. I fear worse then Huxley or Orwell imagined.

       Are you not aware of the massive quantity of scientific research done on vaccines? Below is an overview of the results found from scientific studies that looked for a correlation between vaccines and autism. Notice the common theme in their findings. You can look up any of the articles listed to individually confirm their authenticity.

       Well, I'd rather not live in a future where fearmongering spread on the internet allows the return of infectious diseases. I do not support mandatory vaccinations, I support the education of the population on scientific standards so we don't have to worry about forcing people to get them. An educated population understands the importance and safety of vaccinations.

       The anti-vax movement is not responsible for the resurgence of diseases - at max, they're less than 3% of the population. The massive propaganda push is pass the blame football to avoid corporations having to be accountable for their fuckups. Congratulations for falling for it.

       Just a small sampling. took 5 minutes on google. I could keep coming up with hundreds more if you'd like. Disease outbreaks are related to areas in which people aren't vaccinated.

       I assume you are talking about the latest flu vaccine? It is well documented that because of the way the flu develops, scientists need to select a vaccine that targets the strain expected to be dominant that year. This year, they miscalculated. It does not make them frauds. Frauds are people like Andrew Wakefield who purposely falsify data for personal reasons.

       My claim that acellular vaccines aren't as effective (this is tough, because full cell versions are far more dangerous, so you can't just revert) and that there's a huge propaganda campaign trying to deflect attention from this by blaming the tiny minority of non-vaccinators out there?
      </p>

       The first claim is all over the place - there's even a good paper out there running through what to do about it. The second claim, well, I can assure you that wasn't in the good scientists' list of options.

       Yeah, but you made the claim, so you should at least be prepared to offer best evidence. If I go to google, find a source, and refute it, you could claim strawman, and maybe rightly so.

       I don't believe they should be mandatory. But I do think there should be consequences if you don't get your kids vaccinated and put everyone else in danger. No public school. Organizations such as Disney world can refuse your business. Ect.

       My claim that acellular vaccines aren't as effective (this is tough, because full cell versions are far more dangerous, so you can't just revert) and that there's a huge propaganda campaign trying to deflect attention from this by blaming the tiny minority of non-vaccinators out there?
      </p>
      <p>
       The first claim is all over the place - there's even a good paper out there running through what to do about it. The second claim, well, I can assure you that wasn't in the good scientists' list of options.

       In California last year, opt-outs went down by twenty percent - that's
       <em>
        huge.

       You're tilting at windmills.

       If you truly care about "scientific literacy," please start sharing some instead of rolling around in the mud. Calling people "anti-science" and "stupid" for questioning fact-free propaganda from moneyed interests doesn't increase scientific literacy among the populace in the least.

       Yes you are the way you want the mericle are happening all around you.  Since your vision is so bad that is why I suggest you go to the hospital to speak to a nurse yourself and ask them what they think.
