    <div class="md"><p>The whole insurance and medical model in America is fucked. Throwing drugs at health problems that are primarily life-style based is bullshit. Insurance should be comprehensive and cover gym memberships, dental, acupuncture, chiropractic care, mental health therapy and nutritional training. Diagnostic tests measure things that may not isolate the real root of conditions. I stumbled into my newest doctor when the local hospital closed and everything was reorganized, but I love her. She&#39;s definitely not typical. She gives me recommended book titles, instead of scripts. I&#39;ve been off psych meds, hormones, Vit D supplements, acid reflux for years and I feel a shit ton better. I truly see what is diet, stress, exercise and sigh, caffeine induced symptoms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you hit the nail on the head with the insurance lobbyists.  The ACA or Obamacare, did absolutely nothing to address the COST of health care in America, which is the root problem, of course.  It costs too much to go to the dr period.  It cost slightly less if you do have health insurance, but the ACA doesn&#39;t make anything cost less, it just lets more people have the slight discount for a service that costs too much in the first place.</p>

<p>The ACA allowed more people to &quot;qualify&quot; for health insurance, but that really means the insurance company can charge everyone more because they have assumed greater risk in selling insurance to people they normally wouldn&#39;t sell insurance to.  </p>

<p>I guess this is what you are referring to. I can see their argument, but i call BS on it. Though, theres not much i can really do when, as you said, all arms of the octopus work together.</p>

<p>But then again, they would have to prove that the general welfare of americans will be improving. So far, from all the anecdotal reports ive heard in my personal life, as well as my own anecdotes, and those from just about every middle class citizen, it is hurting them more than it is helping the lower class... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fun thought for sure.

<p>Shit&#39;s the law, and it sucks for most, but it ain&#39;t goin&#39; anywhere until you have  of the House unite and vow to not vote on <strong>any legislation</strong> until this, and other problems in this country, are addressed. I&#39;m talking PATRIOT ACT, NSA spying, all the bullshit wars, the Federal Reserve, etc, all of that bullshit - really just rests with 218 dudes.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, the issue with this shituation is that legal precedence has been set for decades now, allowing the scotus to decide constitutionality through the lenses of the other branches influences (be it appointments, profiteering, etc.).

<p>Also, i think you brought up an amazingly important idea. 218 people to represent the interests and voices of 300 million. That is an incredibly low ratio. I believe i can recall one of our founders (jefferson, maybe?) who suggested thst this would create very bad situations, when the ratio of reps to citizens is very low.

<p>I agree, but the 218 is just for a majority in the House. So it doesn&#39;t represent all People.</p>

<p>The Federalist #58</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The remaining charge against the House of Representatives, which I am to examine, is grounded on a supposition that the number of members will not be augmented from time to time, as the progress of population may demand.</p>

<p>It has been admitted, that this objection, if well supported, would have great weight. The following observations will show that, like most other objections against the Constitution, it can only proceed from a partial view of the subject, or from a jealousy which discolors and disfigures every object which is beheld....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Publius (James Madison) then goes to great lengths to demonstrate why this isn&#39;t a problem. He makes great arguments, but he&#39;s an educated man who knows what he&#39;s doing (and those who doubt this need only look up the Virginia Plan), although he was not pleased with what Alexander Hamilton intended to do and did do with his newfound federal powers.</p>

<p>Wealth always creates influence, and this is generally much increased by large family connections: this class in society will for ever have a great number of dependents; besides, they will always favour each other — it is their interest to combine — they will therefore constantly unite their efforts to procure men of their own rank to be elected — they will concenter all their force in every part of the state into one point, and by acting together, will most generally carry their election. It is probable, that but few of the merchants, and those the most opulent and ambitious, will have a representation from their body — few of them are characters sufficiently conspicuous to attract the notice of the electors of the state in so limited a representation.</p>

<p>I am confident it must be, and that it is, the sincere wish of every true friend to the United States, that there should be a confederated national government, but that it should be one which would have a control over national and external matters only, and not interfere with the internal regulations and police of the different states in the union. Such a government, while it would give us respectability abroad, would not encroach upon, or subvert our liberties at home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Dare I say they are the <em>answer</em>, so to speak. </p>

<p>Imagine uniting a true Third Party under the Anti-Federalist banner? How all-encompassing it is? What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, im only on the seventh paper so far, and the trend i am seeing is very much like how i <em>thought</em> the constitution already was supposed to work. Ill reserve my judgement until i read the 85 most common papers of the antifederalists, so that i can grasp a deeper understanding of their perspective. </p>

<p>But so far, what i can say, is that to successfully lead a party such as the one you propose, there would be a massive amount of educating involved for the general people. And if this party were to win, it would essentially be the last party. I havent gone far enough to tell whether it would even be possible to amend the current constitution to allow for such a confederation. It seems more like the constitution itself, from its very core, must be rewritten. But, i got much more to read and to learn. </p>

<p>I can also tell you that i am picking up everything these guys are putting down, and like i said, i have to rethink so much now, including rereading the federalist papers and some back-research to try and get the bigger picture. </p>

<p>But where i am at right now, an anti-federalist party sounds pretty damn good. (I would probably not want to call a party &quot;<em>anti-</em>&quot;anything, to be honest, as it portrays a negstive mentality, and folks pick up on this, and it would turn them away before they actuslly digest its positioning in regards to the political theater...</p>

<p>So far, im with ya.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It forces more government inefficiency into the health care insurance market.  Insurance companies love it because premiums are going up.  It&#39;s really expensive in a time when the government has no money.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately there are two main issues that people tie up into one:  healthcare, and healthcare insurance.  These are two totally different topics that each have their own unique problems, but when things like Obamacare get discussed, everything is lumped together.</p>

<p>Personally, I would rather have the government stay out of my life.  These intrusions into my personal space are unwarranted.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one thing that a lot of people don&#39;t realize is that this was far more comprehensive than just insurance.</p>

<p>Do any of you know what the state of healthcare information systems was just 5 years ago? When you go to a hospital all of your information is logged by hand in a fucking book..on a piece of paper. None of this information was shared across care providers. Basic life saving information was not accessible to other physicians..or sometimes even your own physician based on their documentation routine. This software has DRASTICALLY influenced both cost and quality of care across the industry. Health systems simply would not have bought or utilized basic software to improve efficiency without incentive from ARRA. So while there are many many shortcomings from the Affordable Care Act..there are also many positive things that came out of it. I think the biggest problem with it is the same problem with most US legislation at this point. Everything is a compromise. So instead of getting legislation that has true potential for good but may make a lot of people angry..you get legislation that is watered down, doesn&#39;t go far enough and is middle ground so as to not upset the status quo. This goes for both parties. </p>
