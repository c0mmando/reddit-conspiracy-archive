       Not only that but you will also see video of Larry silverstien saying building 7 was pulled. So correct me if I'm wrong they entered a burning building and rigged it with explosives while it was on fire?

       In the link to the ATC interview I posted below the guy claims there were jets following at least one of the planes, so they absolutely had the chance to do a shootdown. He also felt the one over PA was shot down.

       How about entering some of the most restricted airspace in the world and being able to fly around the Pentagon with no resistance. Wow, good thing it wasn't the Russian's! Or any other fucking country with fighter jets, etc. Yes, occasionally the US decides to leave itself completely open for assault by any nation. They decide not to use the multibillion dollar air defence system because... Fill in the blank for me.

       The official government conspiracy theory in regards 9/11 and subsequent reports, are scientifically impossible, completely ridiculous and based purely on fantasy, just as bad as the JFK bullet going in through the back of his head and then doing a u-turn in his skull, to come back out the same way it went in.
      </p>

        WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)
       </a>
       , literally gravitational acceleration
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">
        (the official reports even admit this)
       </a>
       which is impossible in a steel framed building (without the use of explosives)
      </p>
      <p>
       This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day)
       <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">
        are classified for public safety
       </a>
       , they will not even release them to a
       <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">
        licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What and why are they hiding this? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles, if we have to go on what they have released so far,
       <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/NIST-collapse-model-building-7.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7's roof is 5.96 seconds
      </p>
      <p>
       For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.

        The tilting of the south tower,
       </a>
       just before collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Sir Isaac Newton’s law of the conservation of momentum, it should have kept tipping over, but it didn't, it fell through the path of greatest resistance. The top was tilting at approximately 20 degrees or so, how could it be exerting a uniform, symmetrical pressure on the floors below? it didn't and couldn't.

       what you are observing is approximately 30 upper floors begin to rotate as a block, to the south and east.They begin to topple over, not fall straight down.The torque due to gravity on this block is enormous, as is its angular momentum. But then  this block turned mostly to powder in mid-air! How can we understand this strange behavior, without explosives?

        Why is the alleged pilot of this plane, not on the flight manifest and how did he avoid all CCTV at the airport, along with all the passengers?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why does the alleged Flight11's flight data recorder show that the airplane was too high to have even struck the lamp posts?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why did they tamper with the only video they ever released, which does not show an aircraft, only a small explosion and why did the FBI confiscate all CCTV in the area, in a coordinated, almost pre-emptive swoop
       </li>
       <li>
        Why does the NTSB not plan to issue a report or open a public docket? The NTSB has issued a report for all planes that crash in the U.S, not for 9/11, Why?

       How would it even be possible that the Pentagon was hit 1 hour and 20 minutes after the attacks began? Why was there no response from Andrews Air Force Base, just 10 miles away and home to Air National Guard units charged with defending the skies above the nation”s capital?
      </p>
      <p>
       and the above is just scratching the surface, the official account is truly bizarre, the probability that it can be true, really is zero.

       All evidence suggests that flight 93, which crashed over at Shanksville, broke up before impact, there were

        debris fields
       </a>
       miles and miles apart to support this conclusion, Donald Rumsfeld even said the plane was shot down
      </p>
      <p>
       But still, we are led to believe that the ground literally consumed the plane! That’s right, the government claims (without a shred of proof or any evidence at all offered to the world) that the plane ended up completely underground. Remember though, they found the drivers license of one of the alleged hijackers, a bit burnt and found ABOVE ground, i am not making this up, this is the official story.

       Any honest and rational person simply can not believe any of the official reports.

       Consider all the lying, assassinations and torture, the spying on all us Americans that has been proven to be true, even news that has broke in the last year or so, don't automatically believe the villainous elements of the US government, namely the three letter agencies, that appear to be out of control and have been for decades

       This guy is a former ATC and wrote the procedures for this prior to 9/11. He said that on 9/11 the procedures were not followed. You are parroting the official response to this point but it's wrong.

       Absolutely not. Are you aware of how many hijackings occurred in the United States prior to 911? Very few, if any. Are you aware what generally occurred when a plane was hijacked prior to 9/11? The hijackers generally attempted to escape the situation alive. The idea of a plane being used as an missile wasn't really considered as plausible or likely as it is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether or not you accept the false flag narrative, fuck ups did occur on the part of NORAD and intelligence agencies. There was a great deal of confusion in air traffic control as well, as evidenced by the publicly available tapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of 9/11, there is no doubt that these processes would've adapted to what was learned, Regardless of who conducted the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering this is now the second time people have put words in my mouth in this thread, I would ask that you make the effort to ask questions about my position rather than accusing me of making poor assumptions.

       Of course I disagree.  The context is 9/11.
       <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a90regularscrambles">
        Before and after 9/11, procedures and response worked efficiently, with dozens of routine intercepts (including 147 in year 2000).

       But that wasn't your "only point" and I corrected the errors for the record.

       No I'm not. I am saying procedures change and considering the fact that a highjacking occurred to horrible effect once it makes sense that the response for these events would've improved, whether it was a false flag event or not.
