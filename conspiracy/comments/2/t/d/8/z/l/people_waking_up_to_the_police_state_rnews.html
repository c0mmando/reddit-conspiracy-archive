    <div class="md"><p>At least from what I read, I didn&#39;t really see anything that surprising or conspiratorial about the thread. I think considering the issues they have caused, a large number of people would be against no-knock raids. I agree that standard needs to be changed and I would not consider myself a conspiracy theorist (by the common definition that is).</p>

<p>I know the many blogs and articles this sub links to would like to have you think that the population that doesn&#39;t believe that 911 or Sandy Hook were inside jobs are a bunch of mindless lemmings eating up the governments every word, but that just isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>Like I said, I&#39;m no conspiracy theorist, but I believe in things like Police reform, drug and prostitution legalization, radically revamped foreign policy in western nations (including decreased support of Israel). I also support less surveillance in public and online and, while I&#39;m not American, I believe in gun rights as well. But because I don&#39;t buy the assertion that WTC7 was a controlled demolition, many on this sub will call me a steeple or a shill.</p>

<p>The idea that everyone is either &quot;awake&quot; or a &quot;sheep&quot; is nonsense. It isn&#39;t that simple and these generalizations get people nowhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. The problem is people in general tend to ignore facts to form their opinion based on their upbringing, personal experience and assumptions. Ya know. When you look at the facts and keep your own personal opinion and assumptions out of the equation thats when you see the &quot;conspiracy&quot;. Thats when you see the truth. Thats when someone is &quot;awake&quot;. </p>

<p>You dont and shouldnt believe in all &quot;conspriacy theories&quot;. If you do you really are an idiot. There are no lizard people. There are no alien shape shipping demons controlling the goverment. Thats disinformation designed to program and persuade people to question the sanity of anyone who questions authority. </p>

<p>For me WT7 isnt a conspiracy at all. I know the towers were brought down by explosives. You can look at history, Look at the scientific evidence, Look at he coverups, The lies and the truths, look at the events of that day, look at the events leading up to that day, look at the events leading to where we are now as a society and just rationally think. Who gains the most from the events of 9/11. What would the world be like if 9/11 never happened? In general. Why would I believe the official narrative of 9/11 when I cant even trust my government to tell me the truth about the fucking air quality. Its happened many times in the last 100 years. The government repeatedly lies to start wars that result in milllions of deaths for its own gain. The government cares nothing about its people and is only focused on retaining and increasing its own power over its citizens that its suppose to represent. There is a extreme disconnect between reality and what the average citizen thinks about the country and environment we live in. </p>

<p>Ya know. Just basic reasoning. There is no conspiracy in the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What scientific evidence do you have to demonstrate that any of the towers fell by  controlled demolition?</p>

<p>I understand not trusting the government, but I&#39;m not comfortable just assuming massive conspiracies without proof.</p>

<p>This ties in to my opinion about calling people asleep or awake. I&#39;ve been looking into conspiracies since Loose change briefly tricked me into believing it as a teenager. Since then I&#39;ve been searching for truth in conspiracies. I am not asleep, I simply have different standards for evidence that have led me to different conclusions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">http://www.ae911truth.org/</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s more than enough factual scientific proof to warrant a full completely independent investigation of 9/11. </p>

<p>Combine the scientific proof and research with the massive amount of &quot;coincidences&quot; and its the most logical opinion I could come up with. There&#39;s much much more to 9/11 than what we have been told. 9/11 set the stage for the approaching Police State and justified the complete disregard of the US constitution by the federal government. All of our worst fears and the most heinous of government crimes have all been justified by 9/11. Indefinite detention. Revoked rights to representation and a jury of your peers. Torture. Massive surveillance. Illegal wars. I could go on and on. Way too many coincidences to just be coincidences. =-p</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh AE911 truth. Often cited, never examined.</p>

<p>Can you link me to any of the collapse models or studies AE911 truth produced to defend their claim of controlled demolition? How did these studies perform when reviewed by qualified structural engineers? </p>

<p>As for the coincidences part, I cant really speak to any specific ones as you haven&#39;t mentioned any. That said I noticed in my experience that many &quot;coincidences&quot; presented by truther organizations weren&#39;t nearly as suspicious as they were initially framed under further review.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In nearly a decade I&#39;ve never found it. If it is easy to find it shouldn&#39;t be an issue for anyone else to provide it. Surely an organization with as much money as AE911 truth has funded some engineering studies regarding the collapses? You know, models produced using the publicly accessible blueprints that demonstrate where the charges would have been placed, what each charge would&#39;ve done and how this caused the subsequent collapse. They would have to use the copious amounts of video footage to assist in this. Of course, they would also need to incorporate into their studies theories on what type of charges were used, how much, and explanations as to why fires or plane impacts didn&#39;t cause premature detonations.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t found that, and you asserting that it exists isn&#39;t going to help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, others are noticing that there is a great division being formed between people and police officers--which is just another part of the <strong>divide and conquer strategy</strong>. We are all in the same boat. The police force is owned, too.</p>

<p>Follow the money to find the real bad guys. The only division we should accept is the enormous wealth gap, the very few super rich and literally everyone else. This is the real enemy. They won&#39;t push this info but they do want you to hate cops!</p>

<p>Who owns the world? Who divides and conquers? Follow the money!!!!!</p>
