       Listened to a talk online years ago that got me thinking more closely about some experiences I had when younger that may have involved contact with off planet beings, and that led me down the path of government and PTB deception of all kinds and forms.

       Well, I wouldn't necessarily say that there is any one
       <em>
        physical being
       </em>
       or person that rules over the entire planet.  I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       feel that there is indeed One Energy that is responsible for All That Is - all that exists, etc - but as far "one being that controls planet Earth"? I think that there are definitely individuals that have absolutely
       <em>
        insane
       </em>
       amounts of monumental power and influence here...and I'm not sure that any
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       of those "ultimate ruling beings" is strictly terrestrially-based, but...as far as the beings that are on this planet that are at the top of the food chain here, I think they themselves are likely little more than "underlings" that were put here to "look after the human children on Earth".  I wouldn't go as far as to say that there is any
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       being that is running everything on planet Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I've been able to research, it seems that it's more small groups or factions doing it.  And I'm not talking about small groups like those individuals in the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) or the Trilateral Commission or
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       types.  I'm talking about small groups that are FAAAAR more powerful than even them; groups that are so behind the scenes that even the heads of the CFR or CIA might not know much if anything about.

       Its the same as I belive. There isnt any one centralized power. Its more like groups fighting for it.

       I'd say that there is in fact a consistency, but just not one that most of us "average humans" (like me anyway) can easily discern.  Seems to me there is an order to it, but you just have to be on the "inside" to have a clearer idea about it.

       See that is the kind of stuff I find fascinating.  You actually belive you had contact with an off world being? Like physical reality or another dimension?

        You actually belive you had contact with an off world being?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No.  I don't "believe" I did.  "Belief" is the word that people tend to use if they don't have any actual data, factual information, or valid, intelligent supposition or evidence indicating a particular thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't "believe" I had contact with an off world being.  I understand and acknowledge that what I experienced has very many parallels with what others who have gone on record as having contact experiences themselves also said they experienced also.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Like physical reality or another dimension?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, technically, even another dimension is its own physical reality...It's just vibrating at a different frequency.  Sort of like radio stations.  99.5 isn't any less real than 102.7.  It's just vibrating at a different frequency so, depending on which frequency you're attuned to, you will either experience this "reality", or that "reality".
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, my experiences involved waking (or semi-waking) consciousness and unconsciousness both.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        was your body transported or your consciousness?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As best as I can tell, although I did experience a conscious, physical sensation (which would imply at least some level of bodily transport), the main feeling I experienced was internal and
       <em>
        deeeeply
       </em>
       cerebral - like...deeply cerebral to a level and extent that I had never experience before and I'm not super sure I've ever experienced since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matter of fact, it's ever so
       <em>
        slightly
       </em>
       unsettling me even right now thinking about it even though this happened...over 30 years ago.  Perhaps "unsettling" isn't the word, as I (think I) made my peace with the experiences and feel myself 100 times more enriched and understanding because of it...but yeah...at the time when it was happening...
      </p>
      <p>

       Thanks for explaining it the way you did. I myself had an out of body experience before. It wasnt off world, it was as if I had exited my physical body and was traveling around.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was strange because there was a limit on how far I could go. It was real as I physically never moved, but was able to explain what went on outside of where I was in the house. There was no way I could have seen what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freaked me out and a few others around. Someone showed me how to do it. We both shared conscience if that makes since. He saw my mind and I saw his. Very strange fellow he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy was able to control elements like wind and water to an extent. Its hard to explain. He told me there are few thst can control water and those that can are usually mentally fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was right in my experiance I have onky met one and she was not right. Some people can see auras for lack of a better term. Sometimes if I concentrate I can see them. This ladies was black. It was unsettling as she was the second that I saw it. The first was a guy that was in jail for raping his 4 year old cousin and then killing her by disembowling her after words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways i witnessed her moving the water in the bathtub without any visible external forces. Whike she was doing so it was some very disturbing voices all around. They didnt make sence as it was in another language.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this was real as I saw and experienced it myself. No one cant tell me otherwise.

       The only thing I can say is that I wish I was there to have seen and experienced it as well.  I don’t doubt that you did indeed experience these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is part of the reason why, as we have been discussing in the other thread, substance use/abuse is ABSOLUTELY unnecessary.  I mean think about it…there are SO many absolutely real and fantastic things that one can totally experience sober!  And, as a matter of fact, when one is sober, one experiences these things in a MUCH better, much clearer way because you have all your mental focus and clarity to concentrate on the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       experience with and you’re mind isn’t clouded by any sort of substance.  I don’t necessarily mean to bring over the topic from one post to another here, but I feel it was very appropriate to mention this here as an example of some of the things I was talking about in the other thread.

       See the feelings are completely up to interpretation. I mean unless you have experienced both high and sober the same experiance you cant really judge it. I am being devils advocate mind you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its my rationalization to the answer you gave. Not to start and argument but rather so you can see it in another perspective. Like in dredd the newer movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was a drug like that shit. Hell yeah I would take it at least once in a comfortable setting. I mean how fucking cool would that be to experiance everything in slow motion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it bad probably.  But you cant really judge someone unless you experiance it. And even then cant really judge them and be right. Now for most you are so right it is a crutch. Just and excuse to dismiss their responsibility.  But others I am not so sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       They seems to need it not in a drug user was but as a human. I dont know maybe I am fucked up for thinking so.

       If you've seen enough people in that state and have a direct understanding of the fucked up things they do and how fucked up
       <em>

      </p>
      <p>
       I've never been shot with a gun before...but I don't need to have that experience in order to know that it's not one that I'd like to have.

       I think your perspective is a
       <em>
        great
       </em>
       one.  I really do.  I happen to share it to a great extent.  I also happen to feel, however, that I have had enough experience to definitively understand that focused, aware, and
       <em>
        sober
       </em>
       exertion and intent is the best (if not almost only) way to achieve proper development.
      </p>

      <p>
       There isn't any substance that doesn't
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       severely hinder your ability to remain aware and focused in the process, however.  At the end of the day, what is infinitely cooler than taking some substance that alters your brain to such an extent that it causes you to see things in slow motion, is being able to actually BE able to see things in slow motion
       <em>
        while sober
       </em>
       and focused.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that comes immediately to mind for me as we talk about this ability to "see in slow motion" is the following example:  I've boxed for over 23 years.  I've done it as a professional, and I've been in the ring and in training camps with some of
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       most amazing fighters that have literally ever lived.  My point in saying this is that over the many years of my doing it, I developed some absolutely amazing skills - so much so that I've experienced occasions when I’ve seeing things like Neo from the Matrix does when the bullets were passing by him and he was looking right at them flew by as he was dodging them.
      </p>
      <p>
       No substances, no chemicals.  What accomplished it was focus, practice, mental and physical exertion, and skills...abilities.  Everything in those moments had the "Judge Dredd" slow motion feeling...except I was 100% sober and focused…not altered by anything…so what I was seeing was pure, real, it was
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       having that experience...not me with my mind altered by any substance which itself kept me from being able to actually understand what was happening properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, anything that keeps you from being able to exert your own autonomous, independent will is ultimately detrimental because it causes you to depend on something that is NOT you.  That's what makes it a crutch and a hindrance.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       I’ve experienced enough to know what it superior to it.  In that sense, I can judge what is indeed better than it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       I wouldn't doubt that there might be some that
       <em>
        aren't
       </em>
       lazy and using it as a crutch.  However, the overwhelming effect it has on people
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       SO OFTEN a negative one that it simply does not become worth it to go down that path - since you will more likely than not end up NOT in a good place or in good shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately though…you know what?  I respect that you have the perspective that you do.  Definitely.  I like your point of view, and think that it seems like a good one.  I know my perspective is most definitely not “the only one” around.

       It is my fault for thinking you were completly closed to the idea that its about what is godly right and damned nation wrong. From most of your responses it seemed like you didnt care or even try to think of it from another view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to some they are lazy hell I am in some aspects where if I could take a chemical to experiance something rather then having to focus I would do it most the time. The thing I dont like about most drugs is you are unable to control most the other aspects of motor function or higher thinking. Thats me thou cause I have seen others that can function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying its right or wrong. Sort of like drinking and driving is wrong but smoking weed to manage pain is up for debate. Its hard to fight the way of change. We will be forced to deal with it as a society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am pretty sure weed will be legal within the USA soon and not for the better of society. Its for votes. I mean who votes right now as a majority? Its usually older people and they are dying fast. The newer generation needs motivation so lets give them weed and they will feel responsible to vote for the ones that made it possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats my take on it. My views are odd sometimes and inwent always like this I used to be set in my ways but thru time I have seen thst fluidity is a better stance for enlightenment in life as well as reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many good people here. I have made friends thru here that interact with digitally as well as on a personal level. It really kind of nice. I have learned a great many things too. Like image to some is so important within their circle. I dont get it. They seem to think they can control another's actions by the vote system within reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same as admin thinks another will just go away with a shadow ban.  The views of so many here in this sub is of anger. I dont know why they think they need to or would even want to change things. Like the middle east. Why change their ways? Its been like that forever. Who is any one person or even a group to make it different?
      </p>
      <p>
       The people that come in this sub to complain and get angry should reevaluate their whole outlook. This sub is for enlightenment and higher understand to issues. A place for discussion. That is what I wish was here. Like this whole convo we have had. We all learned a great deal from each other. I know I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is shit is gonna be this way and the reason it wont change is because we cant agree on a solution. Its so hard to have a discussion like we have had in here without it becoming a shit fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was very nice and would like to get your views on a few other things. I would like to get others who reads this too.

       No worries.  Textual communication leaves a

       to be desired, and it is easy to misinterpret one’s intended meaning.

      <p>
       Yeah.  That’s most people as well.  The problem with that, however, is that one actually DOESN’T experience anything that is “godly” or elevated under those circumstances.  What they experience is just a fucked up reaction in their brain which they can’t even appreciate anyway because they’re FUCKED UP while it’s happening in the first place.  It’s like trying to drive a car after having just downed a six pack.  The vast majority of people THINK they’re okay to drive, but that’s just because their judgment has become screwed up and cloudy and the reality is that they are in about the worst shape imaginable…and if they get behind the wheel, things are going to likely go VEEERY bad for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing applies on any other type of substance.  People only
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       they reach “elevated states”, but they think that in the same manner that someone who is nearly passed out thinks that they’re “okay to drive” and are “driving just fine” if they get behind the wheel even though they are in all actuality doing the most horrible job possible and might end up killing themselves and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the only thing that gets one to a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       state of elevation is focused, sober, controlled, personal volition.

      <p>
       And that is the VERY reason why they can never be used to reach levels of higher thought.  They literally don’t LET you get there because it takes away the very thing that you need in order to reach those levels in the first place:  A focused, disciplined, controlled mind.

      <p>
       The problem with this is that, among the many other negative effects that that substance has on a person, it actually WEAKENS the mind and the focus.  It makes one extremely mentally incapable because it takes away the real
       <em>
        fire
       </em>
       of focus that is possible without it.  If national legalization of it takes place, I can pretty much guarantee you that it will be for the absolute worse of society.  Things are pretty bad as it stands…but you think we as a citizenry allow ourselves and our rights to get trampled over now?  Imagine how much easier it will be for TPTB to continue taking advantage of the population if a large portion of that population has been rendered slow and greatly lackadaisical because of it.

       That is a

I also know that I myself can come across as a jerk, so I wouldn’t doubt that I make people aggressive sometimes in just the way I respond to things.  That’s one thing I’ve noticed about Reddit:  It has shown me that I myself can be a bit of a jerk too.  I mean I’ve always KNOWN that…but some of the conversations I’ve gotten on here have put the mirror up to my face and have caused me to take a look at myself and say “Yeah, man…You can be a bit of an unnecessary asshole sometimes.”  That’s caused me to try to be a bit more…mindful about what I say and how I say it…Cuz I don’t WANT to be a jerk or come across as one if it’s not necessary or called for, you know?

       That is my thought as well. I have heard the argument that a shackled mind needs to have a enlightened experiance.  I dont understand that myself. I have done drugs and didnt feel enlightened I felt as if I was concentrating more on the feelings of being fucked up myself.

       I would be more interested in hearing from someone that did become enlightened after doing drugs and what they discovered as a result. The idea seems fascinating to me.

       You will likely hear from someone who perhaps
       <em>
        thinks
       </em>
       they got "enlightened", but anything that actually alters and changes your ability to think and focus clearly and distinctly is ultimately undermining, self-defeating, and detrimental to the advancement of one's developing perspective.

      <p>
       Because it's, again, a crutch for the weak, and abusers get confused into thinking that 1) the state they're in after using is an "enlightened" one when, in fact, and as you correctly noted, it is anything
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       , and 2) since using tends to engender a deep, deep sense of weakness and dependence, it tricks the user into thinking that the detrimental state that occurs after using is actually the "enlightened" state.  It's actually the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       of the enlightened state.

       I tend to stay away from any and every mind/perspective-altering external substance.  I'm okay with it happening internally of one's own exertion, will power, and discipline, but the external method is, again, the weakling's method, as one doesn't have to develop any sort of self-discipline in order to achieve it, and it tends to cause a

       I often equate the two, as once one understands how generally detrimental and undermining substance use actually is, using
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       ultimately little more than abusing.

       Yes.  I'm glad you said this, and this is very balanced on your part.  That being noted, it would seem that the reason people become involved has to do either with curiosity - in which case it would still fall under "abuse" since the end result will still involve the detriment of the user - or it involves an individual who has a trauma in their lives that is so deep that they resort to substance abuse in order "kill the pain", etc...in which case, then it's DEFINITELY abusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way - casual use or hard use - it seems like abusing to me.

       Certainly.  That's why I made sure and made the distinction when I mentioned substances which are "mind/perspective-altering".  Somebody taking a Tylenol for a headache, for example, doesn't really qualify.

       It has been my distinct experience that many that use this substance
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       easily begin to cross over and begin to use other substances that
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed legitimately illegal, and often a downward spiral is the result.  It's like somebody just watching a "little bit" of porn.  Once one starts, it's generally not easy to stop and very easy to "binge" so to speak to an even more detrimental extent.

       I brought up medical marijuana because I have an for instance to possibly sway you. A good friend of mine that got me started collecting lego. (Yeah I am 35 and collect lego, and not collect like some think. Like have over 1000 sets and only been at it for a bit over a year) he tought me pretty much all I know about it when I started.
      </p>
      <p>
       He used to live in south Carolina and had to have surgery on his back. He was in constant pain and this dude had to have opiates for it. There was no other way he could function.
      </p>
      <p>
       He recently moved to Washington state and its legal there since he has been there he has ditched the opiates (went thru severe withdrawal) and now uses weed for pain management.  This guy is a totally different person. Sure he has bad days and pain but he can still function. You can hear it in his voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now weed is a schedule one and by no means to I propose legalizing it for recreational use. But for medical uses it does work I have seen it.

       I guess the problem I have is that I've seen way too many horrible and deleterious effects that have come about from recreational use that I
       <em>

       </em>
       much favor not allowing it at all.  Too easy to abuse is what I've seen.

       Maybe you are right. And maybe they really dont have a cure. The effects being bad by most accounts I understand as I have been to Baltimore and seen thst bullshit. Its fucked man. The heroin use is just destroyed an entire city.

       The nature of man is to excess unfortunately.  Its the way we are made. We never know when we can get it again so as much as we can without death is the answer most the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some out there that can manage it. Met a few actually. They know their limits and abide to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       First time I ever had a drink was 18. I was at a friends house I met in vo tech college. Like a trade school. (The way you say cheers leads me to think you are in UK or Australia) I wanted to clarify.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways he made me a rum and coke with a lime. It didnt take much before I had a old buzz. Once I did he asked what I felt and I explained it to him. He said ok now stop and savor that feeling. When it goes away then take a small drink wait for a while and it will come back.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then explained alcoholism and how that was to always be chasing that feeling. It wasnt nessacary for that thou. He said it was because you dont need to have that feeling all the time. Only ever so often. Dude was really smart. I never saw him again after that. He just kinda disappeared.  Like most influential people do in your life.

      <p>
       On many levels, it certainly seems that way, unfortunately.  This seems all the more reason to be careful and be very disciplined with oneself so that one doesn’t fall into those excesses.

       Yes.  There are.  Indeed.  Takes a lot of discipline and diligence, but yes.

       Yes.  Again, it takes focus, control, and lots of discipline.  It is not super common…but it definitely exists.

       funny that you mention that because I have to admit that I’ve actually found it very interesting that I myself say that as often as I do.  You wanna know what it is?  It’s that I live in a VEEERY international and metropolitan city, and I’ve come across so many people that have said that, and I’ve seen that they mean it in a cool/nice way, that it kind of got me to say it as well…lol.  But no.  I’m an Amuuurkan!  I just PMed you about it actually.

       He's my favorite when it comes to all things psychedelic.  Well, pretty much everyone's favorite.  Another good one to find on YouTube is Paul Stamets.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people say things like "drugs are ________" I just stop listening and here's why: Drugs are not remotely one category, and any discussion of drugs has to include every intoxicant, meaning alcohol, cigarettes, and prescription meds, among others.  He who has never had a beer has credibility, but also no frame of reference.  Many drugs are used as a crutch, as someone here pointed out.  None more than alcohol.  But to lump psychedelic experiences which are typically spaced out over months or years into the same group as alcohol or heroin used on an hourly or daily basis is pure ignorance.

       I smoke cigs. I do it cause I like the feeling. I dont want to quit either. I am sure if I did then I would. I quit meth cold turkey so I am pretty sure cigs wouldnt be a problem.

       Now for you I ask you have an ooen mind and not shut people down so quickly. Listen to what they say and offer some points to justify your claim.  It works hell it is with me.

       Repectfully, I don't think a re-read of this thread reveals me to be closed minded or to have shut anyone down.  Rather, I expressed my opinion and kept the doors open to the person who asked a question (you, "why would you need drugs"), and I chose not to engage with the person who clearly has a viewpoint he or she wishes to impose on those around them (crutch commenter).  Now, I admit that I momentarily lumped you together, and I may have been a little facetious, but I don't think I came in the ballpark of shutting anyone down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I'm reminded of your question I will give a crack at a brief answer.  It's not just the barriers that we've acquired through agents of socialization, but also biological barriers that are broken down.  As we plod through life human beings develop a framework that allows us to make sense of things.  It's a lattice consisting of everything from knowing the sound of a potentially dangerous speeding car without looking to what we believe about abortion.  If we truly hope to change that structure when new information--truths not formerly revealed--come along that maybe should be closer to the foundation, it is nearly impossible to simply assimilate that into our existing framework.  The neural pathways are already established with the un- or half-truths that were the best fit at the time.  Psychedelics can be a useful tool in unwinding the untruths by allowing you to enter a sort of child mind which is unencumbered by our accumulated bullshit.  From there it becomes much easier to rebuild our personal paradigm using our newly acquired truth in the foundation.

       Your use and frequency dont matter to me. We are not supposed to have judgements about each other. I dont anyways. Its not productive to either one of us.

       As I said before I have done drugs and it was way more frequently then you admitted to. I haven't in a long time.....well actually not true. My friend has got a script for weed and wanted someone to do it with him. So I did. It had been over a decade since the last time.

       It wasnt really good or bad. It did get me to wondering how the fuck anyone could function like that. I couldn't remember wtf I was doing. It was a constant battle to remember to breathe if felt like. I am unsure of a scale of fucked up I was. Pretty sure it was up there. And I did only one bong hit. Lol

       Religion?  Dont take me the wrong way, but I have never subscribed to the religious aspect of anything. Weather it what lord gave us or took away. To me the bible seems as if was written for control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rules of the bible and teachings are normal (majority of population) common sence. That could be because of the bible too and its influence thru the ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to think man has control over all aspects and teachings. Its something we can see and belive as it has evidence. The entire oh you need faith dont work for me. I have faith man will come out as the victor, and will do so because it was his own actions.
      </p>

       I travel a lot for work. I see most the USA and know what I see in poverty stricken areas the most? Churches. God everywhere and I see nothing being changed. People going twice a week and not making progress for the community. Its sad to see.

       We know its not right to kill each other. It feels inherently wrong when you do so. Those that say it doesnt then they are rationalizing it to themself to satisfy a need. Least that's what I think.

       Untold truths? Ha it was nothing like that. I have a questioning demeanor on my own. I really enjoy history and it started in 6th grade when we learned of pearl harbor.
      </p>
      <p>
       It made no sence to me the events leading up to the attack. Why would we tie ships together like that? Why that day? So I started to research more and more. It was then I learned the word conspiracy and what it ment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the untold truth is that we will never know the truth its for the most part speculation until the government confirms it. Then when they do its mostly redacted to never really be clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know some shit has to stay secret. Thats fine for national security. The thing is thou is people think the war was about oil, and I dont for a second. Thats just me and my tin foil hat shining as others say. I am fine with the stereotype until it becomes the moment when another is just saying it to start an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see most people on reddit dont want a discussion they want you to confirm their own theory.  Thats not gonna happen most the time. You have to be open to new ideas and while some make sence many others dont.
      </p>
      <p>
       See you have to ask yourself things like why do we know more about the surface of the moon then the depths of our oceans? Why have a race to the moon? What was so damn important that we had to get there first?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything the leaders of nations do like this is to galvanize the population and boost moral for something else.  To me its that way. Now I could be wrong, but I think that if you got people behind you for something like that they will follow you into any situation.

       Its the problem within reddit me thinks. So many people here dont take the time to explain themself, and then they get upset when they are taken the wrong way. Now right now I am typing all my responses out on a s3 keyboard.
      </p>

       It is important to explain yourself as well as the reasons you came to the conclusion. Otherwise someone will draw the wrong conclusion.

       I will most likely get banned before that happens. I skirt the edge of the line. Most times when I question authority I dont take it well when they wont answer me and I get increasingly persuasive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Got me banned from a great many subs when others wont even try to have a discussion. They just want to argue or they ignore you completly cause they know they cant have a simple discussion based that they are always the loudest and therefore they win.

       Your use and frequency dont matter to me. We are not supposed to have judgements about each other. I dont anyways. Its not productive to either one of us.

       As I said before I have done drugs and it was way more frequently then you admitted to. I haven't in a long time.....well actually not true. My friend has got a script for weed and wanted someone to do it with him. So I did. It had been over a decade since the last time.
      </p>

       It wasnt really good or bad. It did get me to wondering how the fuck anyone could function like that. I couldn't remember wtf I was doing. It was a constant battle to remember to breathe if felt like. I am unsure of a scale of fucked up I was. Pretty sure it was up there. And I did only one bong hit. Lol
