        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I would really like to organize a political protest  against the upcoming visit by Benjamin Netanyahu to give a prime time public televised address to the American people about how Islam  is inherently dangerous to this country,  and humanity in general. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to get some ideas here from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> on how we can organize a meaningful, peaceful protest in DC on the day he comes. </p>

<p>I am willing to spend some of my own personal money that I&#39;m willing to donate to the cause if we need it.  This blatant attempt by the Zionist regime in Israel to influence the internal politics and policies of the United States,  and we must stand against this. </p>

<p>I want to stage a large nonviolent protest against Netanyahu in Washington DC the day he gives his speech,  and I&#39;m willing to pay for the permit, and for people who want to agenda airfare and lodging.</p>

<p>I have never organized anything,  so I look forward to this sub helping out in determining the best usage of the funds available to make this a successful protest rally </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/hT9tQ6C.jpg">This might be why</a></p>

<p>The US Congress is totally OWNED by AIPAC - the infamous Israeli Lobby. </p>

<p>Politicians that understand the power of &quot;<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy">The Lobby</a></strong>&quot; know that kissing Zionist Ass will assure that they have plenty of $$$ in their campaign chests, favorable media treatment, full support from their party, etc.</p>

<p>Politicians that FAIL to understand and respect the power of &quot;The Lobby&quot; usually tend to become <em>former</em> politicians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully support this. My personal opinion is that the best way to get mass support for something like this would be to focus on portraying nantenyahu as a war monger (which he is) while also focusing on a message of peace. It would be nice to be able to wake america up to the crimes of israel, the corruption and evil behind the war on terror charade etc and so forth, but I think right now us sentiment is no more wars, even with the msm vomiting fear 24/7, and fighting evil with more negativity and demonization won&#39;t be effective. It&#39;s got to be a positive spin that  doesn&#39;t just show BenJammin&#39; is a war monger criminal, but also create the idea that he&#39;s just a meaningless pest on the giant peace / anti war / anti bullsh*t movement in the usa. Something people can get behind, like the #illridewithyou tag during the Australian hostage debocle. If they had instead went and had negative/ angry protests, I don&#39;t think it would&#39;ve been as effective. Just my two cents..</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never organized anything like this before,  so I&#39;m really relying on this community to help give insight and recommendations on how best we can utilize resources to maximize the event. </p>

<p>If Netanyahu thinks he can come to our country and preech to us about the dangers of radical Islam while he and the criminal elements of this country fund and arm the same radicals he will say we need to go and kill,  he&#39;s got another think coming.   Netanyahu is a war criminal and belongs in the Hague to face justice,  not a televised joint session of Congress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Netanyahu sure is desperate to unarm all potential oppositions. This guy is going to &#39;dramatically plead&#39; to Obama and congress about Iran&#39;s nuclear program. I wonder why he is so serious all of a sudden to remind the world that he and America are the &#39;bestest friends ever&#39; to everyone. I wonder what his endgame is. I speculate it could have something to do with pissing off armed Islamic countries. That or he wants to tap Iran&#39;s resources, and probably stick a interest charging bank into their system as well.</p>

<p>OP, I would definitely join you all we would need is a date if the news reports are legit. I say get people informed as possible about newts visit, more people should see that he is coming to America in order to influence his own agenda into the States already stagnant political system.</p>

<p>...what we need is the help of everyone out there so that we can continue these, these projects! Now, listen to this, Susan! One of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery! A new planet in the, in the galaxy Alpha- Seti 6 that has intelligent life on it! Amazing! Now, we&#39;re not sure what these beings look like, but one thing is for sure, and they&#39;ve never heard of Jesus Christ! What can we do with the 600 club to help those poor aliens?! What we need, Susan, is we need money to build an Interstellar Cruiser!</p>
