    <div class="md"><p>This world is fleeting. All things are bound to decay. Getting wrapped up in worldly affairs is completely missing the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Care not for the world. Jesus came being the Son of God, died, and rose from the dead. God will save you if you believe on Him. What matters is waking people up and getting God in their life. He can work out the rest.</p>

<p>Go out into the world and preach the gospel. It&#39;s the only way to really make a difference. It doesn&#39;t matter what good you do in the world if you don&#39;t believe in Jesus, because the criteria for being saved starts and ends with believing. It&#39;s the proof He gave us to the power He has to save us.</p>

<p>The world is wicked. It&#39;s a fallen world. God figured us a way out and gave us some homework and studying to do. Only He can fix this mess, and only He has any real authority in this world. Stop worshipping the idols of this world and start worshipping the one true living God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q: Okay, what world problems did religions fix? 
A: Sorry none, they just created more.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t accomodate any while pleasing everyone... We can all agree to this. So in the long term, religions are bad, all of them because, religon A like B but B doen&#39;t like A unless A like C, but A will only like C if D and E stop attacking F... and so on, its impossible to please all.</p>

<p>So the only real solution to this is to please none and ban religions. Without religions you have no creationist, you do not have extremists and so on.</p>

<p>And if people really need some greater being to pray upon, well science is there for them, they can pray to E=MC<sup>2.</sup> at least that equation is a fact if you compare it to their &quot;god&quot;.</p>

<p>MAybe i&#39;m going too far but going to less and the same problem just keep getting worst... Just like the time we live in.</p>

<p>We have tunnel vision creationists.
We have over the top islamic extremist.
We have cult members going overboard and commiting mass suicides.
We have satanist in almost ever viral new music videos.
We have catholic priests abusing childs.
We have rabbis sucking childs dick after circumsisions...
And so on..</p>

<p>Yes a few religions &quot;way of life&quot; if i can name it like htat give good principles to follow and be and be a good person, but you dont need a religion for this, its just an excuse. IT could just be the law and religion arent needed. its just common sense... you dont want to kill your neighbor because his family will retaliate, you do not want to steal because the community will jail you, and so on. common sense, no religion is required for this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I&#39;m not into the waveof people going crazy #JESUISCHARLIE bs of killing extremists with war as USA and allies are doing, more like a ban. You want to be religious then you do it inside your home only. If you do it outside and caugh, you get ticket and pay fees. Also, religions shouldnt start before 18 years old or older in some countries. Because it should be the kid choice to join or not a religion. Same as drinking, smoking, etc. Also religions should be banned from politics, laws, education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, i didn&#39;t want to get too preachy around here. But there is hope in the gospel of jesus christ. </p>

<p>even if you deny the divinity (which i don&#39;t, but we don&#39;t have to see eye to eye on that), the concept of redemption already paid, and the lesson that by our faith we saved, and our works we are not appraised, but simply do the work on this earth that makes it a better place. that&#39;s why Jesus was a carpenter, cause he liked building things. repairing things. </p>

<p>anyways, i know there&#39;s a dark history behind his name, but those wern&#39;t the acts of Jesus, but those later that came in his name and acted like d-bags, and anyone can do something stupid in someone else&#39;s name.  </p>

<p>if you fully accept the faith, then you know that even in the last days, you are safe. for though the flesh may perish, it was but dust anyways, who we are, our souls are to be recieved by the father, so all is well. ofcourse, like Paul taught us, that doesn&#39;t mean to take easy tickets out or to just sin here and there knowing God forgives you, but also realize that we&#39;re human, and we fuck up. and when we do, do our best to fix it, and then move on, because truely isn&#39;t that all we can do? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t like monsanto sprayin your crops? have the community start up a garden. then you know exactly how your food is being handled. i know these things are harder to do in closely populated areas, but there&#39;s always hope. </p>

<p>Jesus said when two or more gather in his name, he is there with them, and with Christ, nothing is impossible. He taught us community, and to love eachother, not hate and kill. </p>

<p><em>shrugs</em> the message inspires me, and others i know. I think reading a correctly translated bible, that is the king james, not the new king james, or the ultra awesome king james, but just a good ol fashion king james bible, and you might come to understanding that even in the storm, there is peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tying into what u/count_vlad666 said.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about you, it always has been and always will be. Don&#39;t get railroaded by the idea of focusing on ones self as being selfish, it is not. Always remember, you can&#39;t help another until you can help yourself, and by this I&#39;m not talking about just getting to that typical adult level of being able to pay your own bills, cook your own food and survive; what I mean is that you become able to do the &#39;true&#39; things that will benefit your community, society and world at large. What will benefit all areas of this world is Love and what this world is currently succumb to is Fear, so that&#39;s where you start. Work at removing all the fears you have about the world, your life and your existence here. You&#39;ll find (if you haven&#39;t already) that all fears boil down to a core which is a fear of death. Many people like to preach they have no fear of death or by being exposed to it so much by whatever means that they comes to understand it and have made &#39;peace with it&#39; and accept it but <em>accepting</em> ones own mortality is not the same as <em>embracing</em> it, see you have to come to a point where you Love death (do not take that as some sadistic sentiment) because death is part of life and what we are all in this phyical world to do is to remember how to Love every part of life by means of a more enlightened perspective surrounding it. You&#39;ll understand when you&#39;ve achieved the ability to embrace death because it will become obvious within your opposite ability to embrace life, you&#39;ll begin to live more fully and begin commiting to more demanding undertakings with less and less hesitation each time.</p>

<p>Do not focus on changing the world outside, change the world inside and the world outside will follow (in time). There is no love outside because there is no love inside. There is no trust outside because there is no trust inside. There is no appreciation outside because there is no appreciation inside. Learn to give these things towards yourself <em>from</em> yourself first and then you will be able to give these things to another. The world is a mirror of a collective conciousness that currently has no love, no trust, no appreciation, no hope and no faith in itself, <strong>this</strong> is what you have to change!</p>

<p>At this point I can imagine a few people and maybe yourself OP wondering &#39;How&#39;s this hippy new agey crap going to stop all the atrosities we see in the world?!?&#39; and to that I ask you the question &#39;What if the whole world did what I&#39;ve outlined here?&#39; and you&#39;ll reply by saying &#39;It would be good but that&#39;ll never happen&#39; and to that I say, then do the next best thing and change what you can and that&#39;s yourself and do it without being dependant on the outcome of whether the rest of the world will follow suit or not.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to elaborate on any area of my post OP if you wish as I&#39;m not a good summarizer when replying to these heavy questions so feel free to ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no one can &quot;save&quot; the world, but each person can save themselves, as minds start to <em>wake up</em> &amp; by saving themselves by seeking truth, comes realization that others are moving in the same direction,</p>

<p>becoming aware of the truth: when we know that we have been lied to, having a new perspective of the world we can start the process of making things right, (being dumbed down &amp; passive didn&#39;t accomplish anything)</p>

<p>with this awareness we then begin to have hope because now we realize that the negative events that happened were created to keep us in a state of fear &amp; hopelessness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A better question is why save the world? What is to gain from it honestly. </p>

<p>The other of giving people hope I need no reason to give anyone anything. You show them how to find hope thru this sub and many are much better for it. The ones that demand anything are not true conspiracy theorists.  They are others looking to disprove what you think. </p>

<p>So many in this sub are of the mindset they are of higher intellect then anyone else. Its the mind frame of many conspiracy theorists.  They have forbidden knowledge.  Or they are just trolls wanting to stir up drama.</p>

<p>I myself see no reason to save the world its impossible.  </p>
