       Need advise.
Up until about a month ago, I was a sheep. War on terror, 9/11, Sandy Hook, the whole nine yards. I believed whatever the news reported. In a way that made me feel safe. As ironic as that may seem. As I ventured into the rabbits hole at first I was fascinated. Being the sucker for knowledge that I am, I took this sub and ran fast. Researching everything I could get my hands on. Last night after watching the rich mans trick, a feeling came over me. One of great despair. Today I stumbled upon Jeremy Scahill's Dirty Wars documentary, and just cried my eyes out. I can't sleep. I had to force myself to eat, and the feeling of powerlessness that has overcome makes me wish I'd never opened this can of worms. The positive outlook and feelings I've felt all my life seem to have died. A new me has been molded, and I feel as if the people that surround me in my everyday life won't be able to understand me  anymore. What do I do? Keep going along with the game? I just can't do that. Should I be prepared to lose them all? There are two sayings I've heard a lot, "Ignorance is bliss" &amp; "knowledge is power." The former I can say is factual, and the latter is most certainly a lie. Knowledge is only power if you have the means to combat the villains that had it long before you. I'm feeling really down. I just want to bring an end to the wickedness going on around us all right now, but I have no idea on how I can help. People just don't care. They're all so busy surviving, socializing, gossiping, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone else had this feeling after being "awakened" (for lack of better term)? How did you overcome?
      </p>
      <p>

       Thank you all so much for the responses. You don't know how much it has helped. I will be sure to check into everyone's recommended video's as soon as I get off tomorrow. My thoughts have finally simmered enough to try sleeping again. Love to each and everyone of you! And again, Thank-you.

       You are where I was about 20 years ago. Many of the things I despaired about 20 years ago, that drove me to the edge of madness, have actually come to pass; the things that were conspiracy then, are reality now.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a normal and healthy reaction. Discovering that your reality is built on lies, the dreams you have been sold are built on lies is not easy. Most people are too afraid; it's easier to say "That's crazy!" and turn away.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're awake now. You can never go back. Nothing will ever be the same. I'm sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn off the tv for awhile; maybe turn it off for good; I did and I feel so much better. It's so obvious that it's all lies that I feel cleaner and happier without it in my life anyway. Turn off the computer and the internet, get up and go for a walk. Go to the park and feed the ducks; smoke a joint, look at the stars. Reconnect with the people in your life that are important; at the end of the day, connections with other people is the only thing that matters; more than money, more than knowledge, more than anything. Do what ever it is that makes you feel good, whatever made you feel good when you were a kid: do that. Go for a bike ride, eat some cinnamon buns. Feel good; life is short, look for the good, because it was always there; seek out pleasure wherever you find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will come back when you're ready. Don't believe anything you read. Snopes is a good place to debunk; don't trust that either.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are good people in the world. More are waking up, every second. We need them all. We need you. You will find answers to all of your questions in good time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people, even people you love, are too scared of the truth. They will never understand. Trying to make them understand is futile; when we discover the terrible truth, we often want to shout it out and share it with everyone, but this is not the path I would recommend. In time, you will learn to ask questions that will show you who is open minded and who is close minded. You will learn how to tell who you can have a meaningful conversation with; who has been driven mad by going too far down the rabbit hole, and who is close minded and scared of the truth, and you'll learn to just talk with them about the weather; you probably won't be able to chat around the water cooler about the latest reality show because there are more important things to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people have the power. That is a simple truth. It's a cycle. We are in a time where the future looks grim. Remember this: we act most effectively within our sphere of influence. The most influence we have, is over ourselves. You can not help others without first helping yourself. When you have a roof over your head and food on your table you are in a position to help others. Work towards a future for yourself, your family, and your loved ones while keeping the truth in mind, and the path forward will become clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome, brother. I'm sorry the truth is painful. It's hard. Now that you're awake you can be part of the solution, not part of the problem. It will get.... maybe not easier; maybe not less painful: but better. It will get better. Maybe you will learn to like the pain; pain means you detect a problem. You can't fix it, unless you know it's there, so pain is the first step on the path to healing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will learn to trust yourself again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Onwards,

       Here's how I like summarize Snopes:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it a conspiracy? SNope it's not! Case closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just skim the
       <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/conspiracy.asp">
        conspiracy theory
       </a>
       page to see what I mean. A red orb signifies that Snopes finds the theory 100% false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single theory is labeled 100% false or somewhat false. Seems like a totally reputable non-biased source to me!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be clear I am being sarcastic and Snopes is one of the worst places to "educate" yourself. I wouldn't trust it with my child's life.

       Snopes is decent in general, usually, but when it comes to things of dissent or conspiracy, they may not very well be accurate.

       Keep your head up and stay positive. Ralize these are just words from a random person on the internet. But this random person means it. If you do not stay positive this will eat you up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody here was once a "sheep". We all had our viewpoint changed when we encountered information that we simply could not dismiss.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are feeling like your life has been turned upside down, I want to attempt to repeat something that has helped me: We all lived being unaware. Think of the time you lived before being aware. You still lived. The world didn't end. And now that you're "awake", it's still okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should be happy that you've encountered information that plunges you into a new understanding of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how do you combat willfully ignorant people? Simply be yourself as who you are now. Do not censor your thoughts and beliefs. Maybe your newly created thoughts/opinions will rub off on people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot force somebody "awake". They double down on their existing beliefs. You can only lead them to awakening.

       He'll start to realize when you start talking to others about all this information, just how sad and depressed that will make you.  The information itself isn't really whats so incredibly depressing, it's trying to talk to anyone about it.  :(

       Which is why I regularly point out the importance of group chat shows like WDIL , MaxResistance and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AustralianRoundtable">
        AustralianRoundtable
       </a>
       . These shows all have live chat forums available so listeners can converse, even if just for a few hours per week, with like-minded people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can even skype in to MaxResistance to chat live on the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the main reasons why the false narratives prevail is because those who awaken to them soon feel alone and isolated. This is why the internet is so important to our cause, as those who know (or are shown) where to look can find a huge and growing community of people just like themselves.

       If I were TPTB (or their minions) I would be trying to 'shut it down', too.

       I have experienced this up until recently, when I found a colleague who shares the same thoughts as I (at least, to a degree). I have given up with most, however - some have even said what I say might indeed be correct, but they don't care as it is, and I paraphrase, "too much effort to care".

       Breathe deep.  The shock will wear off, and you will come to terms with how to deal with the sheep that surround you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, immerse yourself in the reality, and inform yourself.  Recognize that you are not "venturing down the rabbit hole", but you have actually just crawled out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth really will set you free, and you will be a much better and stronger person.

       I almost want to say that
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       who has had a real awakening has.  What you described in its own way sounds very similar to what I experienced myself.  I had always kind of felt that things were a lie and weren't right, but I had a pretty serious crying fit when it dawned on me that the US murdered 3,000+ of its own citizens with the help of Israel, etc on 911.

      <p>
       I've never had a very rosy outlook on this life, so it's not like I got my bubble burst too badly, but I think it's important to realize that, at best, this planet is a
       <em>
        school
       </em>
       where we learn very difficult lessons.  Shit ain't easy here, and those that think things are just aren't paying attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignorance is
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       bliss, as it always comes up and bites you in the ass sooner or later - and the longer it takes, the more it'll hurt.
      </p>
      <p>
       And knowledge is ALWAYS power.  It's just that sometimes your mind and body are not ready or able to
       <em>
        handle
       </em>
       that power.  Take it in in little bits.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's, again, a long process.  Realize that this world is one of WORK.  Shit ain't rosy.  It ain't fun.  We're here to learn and work.

       Do something small. I may or may not sneak off into the night and plaster information onto posts and walls in my town. If you can get one person to do a Google search then you've succeded. It's a small victory. But if a lot of people make small moves, the large changes will start to happen.

       "Do something small" is huge. From printing out small stickers that have a catchy picture or phrase placed strategically somewhere, posting witty and smart comments online, pointing out the all seeing eye on the one dollar bill with a pen, making memes, putting stickers on items at the store, and placing magnets on public video cameras.

       The best thing that you can do for yourself is check your sources, and KNOW YOURSELF. Think about your ideologies and past beliefs and trace them back to their origin. 
Keep digging, and try to inform the people around you. Don't make baseless assumptions, but if something seems fishy then follow up on that hunch. I'm a history buff, and that's what has put me on the right track. Study history, and learn from it. Get good at deciphering historical lies. (Did you know that the Gulf of Tonkin incident never happened? Did you know that MLK was actually assassinated by the US government?)

        Full Speech
       </a>
       of Kennedy's, "The President and the Press" American Newspaper Publishers Association. Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, NY.
      </p>
      <p>
       This speech was given 10 days after the bay of pigs. Kennedy is talking about communism and the cold war. He is discussing the balance between our freedoms of speech and the responsibility of newspapers to not publish information that might compromise national security (similar to the WWII "Loose lips sink ships" slogan). He is making an appeal (not a decree) to the newspapers to be more discreet with the information they publish.

       Being aware of the truth has actually opened up a ton of opportunities for power and money for me because it's a lot easier to predict how things in different industries will play out. Yeah, maybe making money off these things is selling my soul to the devil, but I'm doing more good now then ever before in my life.

       Others here may disagree with me, but  take time to "decompress". I mean days or weeks away from this sub, or any con related material. If your head and thoughts are in it all the time you will be overcome with despair. It's important to know when to say "I've had enough for now, I know the truth, I'll research things again next month" and then exit the rabbit hole for a bit of fresh air. We all have lives in the real world to get along with, whatever we know about what's happening underground.

       Welcome to the rabbit hole, brother/sister.  Your journey has just begun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember the feelings you're currently experiencing as so many others have and will.  You are not alone!
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was first awoken, listening to music sometimes helped.  I especially recommend Immortal Technique and The Ancient Order.
      </p>
      <p>
       For every one of us that is open about our awakening, there are others who are hiding it or denying it.  Always research the topics you're most interested in and always seek to evolve your beliefs as you encounter new information.

       Take your time to process this sudden
       <em>
        flood
       </em>
       . How do you go about sorting out
       <em>
        your life
       </em>
       in the midst of a massive flood? What do you react to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn off your TV. Be sure you get some exercise and sunshine. Make an effort to really
       <em>
        see
       </em>
       your personal surroundings, your immediate neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Focus on yourself for a few minutes, several times during the day: Gut Check! What is driving you, directing you, feeding your quest?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can still be a positive being in the midst of a flood!

       Knowledge is indeed power.  You are one of the lucky few sheep who opened your eyes and realized the truth.  It may be overwhelming at first, but bear in mind that you are now in good company.  The government and the media can't try to pull the wool over your eyes without you questioning them and their motives.  Look at this as a new awakening and not so much as a disappointment of the ignorance-is-bliss attitude you were indoctrinated to accept.

       People use the term, "awakened." If you only wake once in life, you've failed. Keep waking. Keep dreaming. Keep waking. Repeat. The real journey is not out there. It's within you.

       <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_bloodlines">
        the Hidden Hand interview
       </a>
       . It's an interview with a member of the ruling elite, basically telling us that there has to be a negative polarity on this planet to aid our spiritual evolution. He also discusses reincarnation and stuff like that, which I'm really into now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the
       <a href="http://www.lawofone.info/">
        Ra Material
       </a>
       , which is the same kind of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was really depressed after waking up and these really helped. I've just read
       <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Many-Lives-Masters-Prominent-Psychiatrist-ebook/dp/B007IL4XGQ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;sr=&amp;amp;qid=">

        The Earth lines are not aware of the bigger picture. They themselves are not of our Lucifer group soul. As far as they are aware, they are out to rule the world, to control and enslave, and to create as much suffering and negativity as is humanly possible. That's what they get out of the deal – world domination. You'd have to say with that in mind, they're doing a great job.

       Fuck that hidden hand interview lol. Its just the Ra material regurgitated with a twist of "its all a game and we all love each other in the end". The person writing may be one of the elite but it sounds like the Ra material has been used to rationalize all the shitty things they are doing and the Ra material came out decades before that interview.

       I don't know if you've read the whole thing but the link I provided was just a summary of the full interview. He/she answered the questions pretty much in real-time so if it's a hoax, it's a bloody good one.

       Believe me - I get your cynicism as I used to be ultra-cynical. I started reading up on Taoism/Hermeticism/metaphysics in general, though, and it pretty much changed my life, let alone helped me deal with the red pill. I'm not such a negative prick these days but that doesn't mean that I'm just going to put up with getting fucked by politicians and bankers so I'm still on your side bro!

       I've read the HH thread several times and am still enthralled by it. Looking forward to reading that many lives, many masters. Any other material's you'd suggest?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what do you make of still being here even after the harvest date? Do you think we all actually did die in a cataclysmic apocalypse, go to zero point time, then reanimate on a duplicate earth to try to once again master our compassion? I know we experience existence through a veil of forgetfulness but damn dude... The thought of dying and never remembering it is a little hard to swallow.

       Sorry for the delay dude - been decorating my house so haven't been on here much.

       I quite enjoyed

        The Infinite Mindfield
       </a>
       , which is about the pineal gland's role in transporting people to different realities/dimensions. I bought this off the back of watching
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62raWpUzdr0">
        DMT: The Spirit Molecule
       </a>
       , which I think is what got me into metaphysics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've just finished reading
       <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kybalion-Hermetic-Philosophy-Ancient-Greece-ebook/dp/B00DT7FW4K/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1422867560&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;keywords=hermetics">
        Kybalion: A Study of The Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece

       , which was also pretty good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm planning on getting some more Brian Weiss books soon, not sure which ones, though. My mum has serious anxiety problems so I got her to read Many Lives, Many Masters and she is a changed woman. Really good book.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what category I'd fit into with regards to the Harvest (i.e. not sure if I'm evolved enough to leave this negative polarity) so, if there is one, I'm not sure what it would hold for me. I was a staunch atheist until recently so I guess my conversion might count for something.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a bit in Many Lives, Many Masters in which the subject describes the end of one of her previous lives. She drowned with her baby in her arms, which made me wonder if that could have been a harvest. Don't like the thought of my kids going through it, though!

       Thanks for getting back to me. Was about to reach out to ya again because I'm extremely interested in this subject matter and have very few to converse with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had an epiphany last night while watching the super bowl of all this. Since our pineal gland is photoreceptive and is placed in the center of our minds looking up it's very likely that the image we receive from our eye's which is then reversed to be being seen right side up is probably just the pineal gland processing this duality and rendering it down to a single image. So it's not an image from the lids of our two eye balls which is our reality but rather our consciousness processing information from our soul gate or star gate. Idk, made sense to me last night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking forward to digging through this material though bro!

       Others have covered the importance of the feeling. I want to consider its uses as mechanisms of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that inducing dread is a means of controlling people. I've had a much gradual introduction to these things, so it never hit me at once. This is the thing people look away from when they openly freak out about forbidden truths. You have seen it, and kept looking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there are horrors and weird things in this world. Nothing defying logic and careful study, but still weird. But unlike the controlled alt-media dread inducers (i.e. Scahill) would have you believe, all is not lost. Indeed, these are the last ditch effort of tho who have manipulated you with lies to abandon your pursuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feeling don't come out of nowhere, though, so it's probably worthwhile to consider its history. Have you felt like this before after discovering something? How did the people around you react?
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend taking the time to reflect on things until you are satisfied. What does this new knowledge mean for you? How does it affect your actions in the world? Do you have plans you now need to change?
      </p>
      <p>
       The world can be a scary place. Knowing scary truths lets you plan around them, often better than others. Plan accordingly.

       I started paying attention shortly before 9/11. Before that, I was just as happy as anyone else to go along with the popular dogma. But I never really got that feeling you were talking about until I watched
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSyFD51vN_4">
        "Who Killed John O'Neill"
       </a>
       . It was so information dense, I kept pausing and researching and pausing and researching.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 hours later I emerged from the other side exhausted. I had a need to reconnect with society, to shake off what I'd just heard. So I did the worst thing possible and decided to go mall walking. That's the closest I ever came to a panic attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will never see things the same again. This is a fact you have to accept, and fighting against it - the massive cognitive dissonance that is generated from a lack of acceptance - will either kill you or drive you insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next struggle of becoming 'aware' is fighting the urge to scream 'the truth' from the rooftops. None of us knows the truth, and not everyone is ready to hear anything approaching the truth, least of all from you. You're going to lose people you considered friends. People are going to question your credibility. Some will just dismiss and ignore you. Don't keep bashing your head against the wall of the herd mentality, you'll only crack your skull open. Like others here have said, when you quiet down some, you'll begin to identify the people around you that you CAN discuss with. These are the people you will depend on to vent and conversate about these topics. They need to be able to do the same too. You're not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next phase is realizing that you don't know anywhere near as much as you think you do, and that some or most of what you know may be misinformation or incomplete. This is the phase where most people have to pause and decide how dedicated they are to a deeper understanding of how the world works. Because to progress past this point, you must dive BACK into the fracas and start trying to sort out what is objectively important and what is chaff. This takes a lot of effort, time, and energy. And dedication.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phase after that is the one I'm at now, just emerging into. And that is to realize that not everyone can or will be saved. Many
       <em>
        don't want
       </em>
       to be saved, and it's not your duty to change their mind. All you can do in real time is inform and prepare yourself. You begin to focus on the small changes you can make around you. You begin to take pleasure in being the quiet iconoclast that people go to for the real skinny or a second opinion on the sly from accepted social conversation. You remember that the point of life has always been to appreciate the little things while they're here like it's the last time you'll have it. (I personally revel in every hot shower I have, because I have a sneaking suspicion they'll be one of the first things to go and one of the last things to come back.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important parts of being a successful researcher; to participate as you are able,
       <em>
        discuss
       </em>
       the dogma in impolite situations
       <em>
        while being respectful
       </em>
       of others who disagree or don't want to engage,
       <strong>
        staying emotionally detached from your stance on world affairs
       </strong>
       , and remembering that your life is still your own, so enjoy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like you need a break, so take one. The world isn't going anywhere. This fight is as old as the human race. While we need your help, we can carry you on our backs for a little while.

       My recommendation, what helped me was to start producing content, share what I know and love online. I started in 2005 and have never looked back. It's kept me sane and happy, not to mention that, from the feedback I have received, it has helped others in their lives.
      </p>

       Start sharing information and what makes you happy.

       The advent of the Internet (and all its creations) have opened this Pandora's box to you. Its how you use it is what is truly important.
      </p>
      <p>
       This statement is true because you can see that governments and corporations trying to find ways to limit it / control the Internet or spying and recording everyone's (the public) actions but we can't record or see what they are doing!
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to also remember that entities also use the Internet for their gain and propaganda as well. That's why its important to find and vet your sources while battling the "elitist trolls" that pop in to harass users or subs.

       Every single one of us has been right where you are. The good news is that now that, even with this new outlook, you're day to day life really doesn't change. You still have the same job, friends, family, and goals. There's no need to jump off whatever path you were on before this realization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel lucky that you are having this moment now and not 10 minutes after all the money in your bank is gone or 10 minutes after all the lights have gone out. You now have ample time to prepare yourself and your family for whatever may come. Tell the closest people to you why you are feeling stressed and why you are now taking the steps you are to ensure the safety of your familys future. DO NOT start running your mouth about 911 or alien technology in polite conversation or engage anyone in these topics that is not interested (you will marked in the back of their minds).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the steps you should take to ensure your safety:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Diversify your money. Buy gold, silver, foreign currencies, valuable objects, just don't get stuck with all your money in one of these big insolvent banks. Their time is limited.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Buy storable food and water. If the lights ever go out, this will be what keeps you from panicking and will give you time to figure things out. The people that panic and start looting and stealing will be the first to go.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Buy a rifle. Its your right and its the only way to truly protect your family.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Speak out. Find the people around you who feel the same way and make sure you have a community plan god forbid the worst comes. For people who will call you a loon or a conspiritard, just smile and say "you're probably right". Engaging in angry arguments just makes you look bad (you are in the minority now so watch what you say).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Tell your family and friends how much you love them every day and be the positive light in darkness. Now that you have a relatively darker outlook on how the world works, its important to counteract that by being positive and realizing that every day is a gift. Don't worry about things that are out of your control and if the worst ever comes, be the guy helping those around you, not the one taking advantage of the situation.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       And remember what Socrates said, "The key to change isn't to destroy the old, its to focus completely on building the new". Hope that helps. Good luck and god speed brother.

       I will just say if it hurts, you're waking up right, and for good.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been a few times when I kinda wish I could go back to sleep but those moments are fleeting. I'd rather be educated, prepared and aware than dumb, docile and panic-stricken when they pull the plug.

       Take up activities to prepare yourself. Learn how to grow food indoors and outdoors, learn weapons fundamentals, learn basic survival techniques, and for gods sake put away food and water. You can get huge bags of rice and beans for cheap. Be as prepared to bug-out as you may need to be to bug-in. Pre-decide a destination and as safe a route to get there in a worst case scenario. Practice hiking at night if you can. Acclimate yourself to bad times in practice mode and when, not if, but when TPTB decide to Building 7 the country in order to blame Russia or China or Iran for something you will have a clearer mindset.

       Last but not least, in fact probably most importantly, turn off the TV, unsubscribe from cable immediately, stop getting or even reading the newspaper and (up to you) avoid movies even. The propaganda is stuffed into them as well so that your brain sees it even if your eyes don't.

       Yep, I have felt exactly how you feel. I'm actually at a point of defeat. I've been awakened, for lack of a better term, for about a year. I've always researched random shit very deeply and take into consideration both sides to come closest to the truth. I came to r/conspiracy expecting to read about ufo ' s and Bigfoot....not the case. Anyhow, I became aware of some of these situations and quickly learned how close minded almost everyone is. I have not found one soul who I can have a conversation with about these things. I come off as crazy, which really fucked with my head. Eventually I just gave up. I was actually turning crazy. Now I view the world in a different light and can see most things for how they are. I'm better now for it, but you have to catch yourself before crazy sets in. You can't make the world see the writing on the wall, just enjoy the show.

        I'm feeling really down. I just want to bring an end to the wickedness going on around us all right now, but I have no idea on how I can help. People just don't care. They're all so busy surviving, socializing, gossiping, etc.

      <p>
       Look number one I feel for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number two: You should have gone through being a Marine and fighting for the shitheads abd dealing with that crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number 3: you will not be able to change and educate everyone's mind. There will always be many caught up in the matrix programming refuse to wake out of their cognitive dissonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number 4: Just take it one day at a time and be happy with yourself and support and love your family even if they disagree with you. They may wake up one day and then some may never. You have to accept that. Pls you need to have thick skin and not give a fuck with those that think you are an idiot conspiracy nut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number 5: You should be happy you woke up and know what you know which sets you above many others who will never know the true knowledge. However you must be able to discern what is really true. Somethings given to you are disinformation to confuse you. Just try to know the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number 6: Take pleasure in the good things in life and not let the bastards get you down. Because that is what they want. For you to be depressed and unhappy and kill yourself off, and to destroy all the loved ones around you. Go to work, be a provider in your home and have sex and riase kids. They always will lighten up your life when you play with them. They can be therapeutic often if you learn to have fun with them. You will have a chance to educate them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't ever let the bastards win over your soul. Rise up and fight it. You have to be a tiger about it. Even if you convince one of the truth out there then  you made a change. All it takes is like so called missionary work. The message spreads one by one over time.

       "When you're born in this world, you're given a ticket to the freak show. When you're born in America, you're given a front row seat." - George Carlin
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f0GStBCeUU">
        This 4 minute clip of an interview w/ George Carlin is basically how I view everything now.
       </a>
       The above quote I now have engraved into a beer glass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I awoke around 13 months ago and actually felt quite differently.  I awoke to a life full of sleepwalkers and I saw an opportunity.  Rather than despair, I actually felt like I finally had a purpose.  Unfortunately that feel has died down while the Carlin-esque view grows, though I'm never ruling anything out.
      </p>
      <p>
       My view on the world has been completely warped since last winter.  New stories each and every day drive me crazy, but it's not quite as painful when you put on the Carlin glasses.  I now see something like the world leaders "marching" for Charlie Hedbo (where a zoomed out camera showed no one was with them) and simply laugh.  The world is a stage, and these are just the gradual acts being played.
      </p>
      <p>
       ADD: Thanks for this post, I just smoked a joint and watched George Carlin skits for two hours.

       We are beacons.  You can reflect and transmit whatever you want into the universe, and the universe has to respond in an equal fashion.  You're signal is becoming clearer, your own, unimposed upon.  I know it seems dark, and for a while you may feel alienated.  It will be ok.

       It happens man. The last five years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for me. The good news is you're alive and awake in the most exciting time ever in our history. Keep your head up and your stick on the ice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wave of shit will pass. The good stuff will come.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something I've never shared with people here (because it sounds cheesy) is that I made a deal with Earth. I told her that I would do my best to work for her interests if she would give me back a sense of happiness. At that moment it felt like she gave me a big hug and a wave of love came over me that was undeniable. Tears happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something really important in this experience for me is humility. The concept being holding your mistakes up for the world to see and learn from. The payoff being not carrying around the negative baggage from those mistakes. It really does work. It's embarrassing though so we shy away. It sometimes takes real courage
      </p>
      <p>
       We all can be our own worst enemies, but we don't need to be that way. This is where the conspiracy ties in. The established powers in this world want us disheartened and are actively pushing this agenda through their channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm pushing the hippie angle here a bit but in my experience this knowledge has made me a more happier, healthier human being. Enjoy the ride!

        Welcome
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who has been awake for about 10 years i can tell you that, at least for me when i first started to rise from my slumber i felt exactly what you are feeling, the hopelessness of it all was overwhelming i felt nothing but despair for months. even years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after years of research and meeting other people i've come to realization that we(The People) are in fact waking up at an higher and higher rate, and i am convinced that it will reach a tipping point sooner rather than later.
      </p>
      <p>
       When that happens we will have our chance for redemption and action, whether that means dying a matyres death in the town squares of our Governments and slave masters, or building up self-sustainable communities using modern technology and cooperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now a small quote from Charli Chaplins The Great Dictator, to get your hopes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       To those who can hear me, I say "Do not despair." The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

       Don't know but I am sure a lot of people might have said what I will before but ill still throw my 2 cents. The management of this new influx of knowledge might overwhelm you, but you should not get bogged down by feeling of helplessness. Look at it this way, before knowing it all, you were less powerful. Knowledge is indeed power even if it doesn't give you ENOUGH power to make a change around you, but it had changed a lot within you. That is power is it not? Share your thoughts and those that outright shun you without reason, remove them from your circle...its an auto test to weed out the lesser minds from your life. I am not saying that you should reject people if they don't agree with you, instead reject those that reject your ideas without cause...if that makes sense. Keep digging, learning and keeping yourself aware, it will ultimately make your immediate surrounding more understandable. I would rather be a miserable , wounded lion, than an ignorant sheep. Stay positive and take joy in the fact that you are now more awake than you were before. We are not immortals, we will all die one day, but its better to die knowing that you weren't that easy to fool. Sorry for the long rant, it doesn't contain much info, but a chain of thought I wanted to share, because once upon a time, I was in your shoes.

       It will pass. I remember after the Boston debacle I threw my TV out the window. I could barely speak to anyone who didn't get it. It was Terrible. But now I have done what I can to make myself feel safe and I truly believe that knowledge
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       power. Also I open my mouth.  I don't let people say dumb shit about what is going on in front of me without throwing out some truth. Also find someone to talk with that doesn't think you're crazy.

       To be honest. Same thing happened to me. But all I kept doing was speaking my mind. You have to be persistent, but that pays off. I always tell my parents about how I feel about false flags and other tragedies. My mother recently told me that at first they thought I was insane, but I persisted and kept displaying good judgement and sound reasoning and now my parents are at the point where they're on board but too scared to admit it. It's a battle. You took the red pill, welcome to the matrix. Shits gonna get real, emotionally, but you must always keep a sense of humor. Look at how obvious it all is now, it's comical. Think of the power your voice has. You are the controller of many people's thoughts with what you say. Just be sure to not isolate from the sheep, just keep expressing yourself. You'll know your limits and triggers and if you really want to build yourself you will push them. Just remember that you will have to look for support rather than passively receive it. I used to be so supported by my friends but they weren't really supporting me, they were supporting that I don't make them think uncomfortable thoughts. That's just part of the sheep programming, not entirely their fault. I always tell myself as a reassurance not to take the blue pill again that ignorance is bliss, but it's most always bliss at other people's expense.
Thanks for making the more difficult, but more mature cognitive choice my friend.

       "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."
       <strong>
        (John 16:33)
       </strong>

       God is controlling the storm. It's meant to wake us up to the reality that the world is fleeting and bound to constant decay. He left us His word as a testament to what's really going on. This is a spiritual battle for your soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're under a constant barrage of atheistic material every single day. Spiritual wickedness has taken over control of everything. When you give your power and life over into the hands of men, you get what you signed up for. If you trust in the world, the world will fail you because it's designed to fail. Nothing lasts, but God is forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       People get too wrapped up in the worldly trappings that they completely miss the big picture. We're taught nothing matters, everything came from nothing, and to nothing it will return. It's a religious belief system designed to enslave you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to live in this world. I do not enjoy this world. I would rather die and thought long and hard about suicide for many years. My niece was just in the hospital for attempting her own life. People are killing themselves every day. When you don't think anything matters it changes how you see the world. They're the one's telling us nothing matters... Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you understand God must exist and seek Him, you find a much different picture. We are significant. He knew how terrible this world would be for us and understands. That's why He left us the whole story from start to finish, and He sent His Son to die for our transgressions and wipe our records clean. We must simply believe he died and was resurrected. You are saved by faith alone, and He left us all the evidence in the world so that even the most skeptical (as you should be!) could trust in His word.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a chance for something better. We just have to do our homework, wake up, and then start waking people up! Contrary to row, row, row your boat - life is not a dream. They've been brainwashing us since birth... The greatest thing we can do to combat that is sharing the truth with people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This world is coming to an end soon. I welcome that and I want it to be over. What sane person doesn't? At least we can be aware that the truth is out there. God is real and we can prove it because He gave us the tools and information necessary to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're going to wake people up to this reality and slip a false Christ in with some slight of hand. They know what the Bible is and that every word is true. This is Satan at work here... He knows who he's up against. God told us these things so that when we see them... we would believe. You can find all the details in the King James' version of the Holy Bible.

       It certainly is not free of manipulation, you are right in that regard. The KJV is the only reliable translation in English for many reasons. We can see the tampering done with other translations since.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible makes it very clear to be aware that God's word is being tampered with. In fact, it's very clear that through the validity of God's word they will deceive the world into a false Christ.

       Fist of all, that doesn't really prove that the flood happened, all it proves is that the explanation was likely the rising water levels at the end of the ice age, and this information being passed down and twisted.. Secondly, even if it did somewhow prove something, the majority of those stories are claimed to have taken place long before the claimed date of 4500 years ago, which makes sense when you account for the end of the ice age. I could also go into the specifics about why the biblical flood is impossible if you'd like.

       First of all, I'm not a shill, we've been over this. Secondly, you have yet to properly explain my three issues. So just to make sure, I'll restate them:

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Where did the water go after the flood?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>

       Short answer: It's still here. The flood changed the topography drastically, pushing up mountains and creating massive valleys for the water to settle into.

       </a>
       discussing this issue that can clear this up. In short, the kinds of animals needed fit more with the family classification than the species class. The ark was huge, not small... the dimensions are given in the Bible. The gene pool would not have been as mutated or limited at the time, and we see this with Noah being 600 at the time of the flood. Incest laws did not come in until Moses brought the Israelites out of Egypt, and prior to that they wouldn't have had the same issues we face today thanks to their genetics being more pure. Remember, we all come from two humans. Cain must've married his sister.

       But as we've been over, the original verses actively mention the mountains as being engulfed, and make specific reference to them being so high, not reference to them being lowered.

       Sadly, this video makes a number of errors. Firstly, the beginning of Chinese civilization is closer to 4800-ish years ago, although that number becomes even older if you add in earlier Neolithic cultures. Secondly, does not realize that all those records do not point to monotheism, but actually to animism, which is a very different (and often polytheistic) religion. Shangdi is the supreme god, but it is certainly not the only one (similarly to how Zeus is not the only Greek god). This really just continues to go on, like his reasoning that putting heavens and earth before humans in terms of creation proves it's identical to the old testament, while ignoring the fact that it wouldn't make sense to have people be created before the sky or the land. Also, the first script we find is the Oracle bone script, which dates to around 1400 BC at the earliest, not 2500 as this persons claims. But overall, he far too often picks and chooses words to fit his conclusion (such as how his explanation of the word create really does not just apply to the creation story, but thousands of other things, except that he just picks the thing that furthers his point). Also, on a side note, since the claim is that any pictographical writing system would record such a thing, why do we not see it in writing such as Egyptian Hieroglyphs?

       The only difference, is that you have things flipped. The fable to me seems like the one that does not actually have any evidence to support it, and makes claims that have no evidence, such as a flood wiping out the earth despite the many issues with such a claim. I think you get where I'm going with this...
