        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have surfed the wep for some time now, I have seen a lot of documentaries regarding free energy, zero-point energy, Nikola Tesla, T. H. Moray and cold fusion.</p>

<p>So I started to wonder: Why don&#39;t we have free energy yet?
Well I actually think that there might be 2 main reasons why this is the chase.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It would be a matter of national security if a free energy device capable of producing vast amounts of energy were created and given to the public. Why? You may ask: Answer: According to science one cubic meter contains 10<sup>113</sup> joules of energy because of vacuum/zero-point energy. 
Now, what do you think would happen if terrorists got their hands on one of these cubic meter energy sources? (they could make a lot of damage) So naturally the USA will never acknowledge the existence of such a device. </p></li>
<li><p>A free energy device would mean that we would be able to create a society based on abundance. But businesses who have made their fortune on scarcity will never allow this to happen because if it happens then they will lose their business and power in society.</p></li>

<p>How do you expect to ever buy one if.</p>

<ol>
<li>It is considered a matter of national security.</li>
<li>Patent offices wont grant a patent.</li>
<li>The science behind it is classified.</li>
</ol>

<p>To me it looks like the only way to ever get your hands on one would be to either make it yourself. Or get some help from the free energy enthusiast. (They are considered nuts anyway so who would belive their claims if they succeded). </p>

<p>In time yes. But the funny thing about breakthroughs is that it takes time to adjust to the breakthroughs. The wright brothers were laught at until people discovered what they had done, Peter Higgs were laught at when he explained his theory about the higgs field, Tesla had to fight Thomas Edison in the War of the currents before society implemented the AC system.</p>

<p>So no. Everyone wouldn&#39;t necessary belive them (especially not in a time where computeranimation can perform wonders).   </p>

I am an EE student on my hopefully last semester now and if I managed to discover a way to cost-efficiently harvest energy, I will charge you for it, maybe not that much but you still have to pay a penny for every kW-hr it produce.  </p>

<p>True. Which is why I have corrected my mistake in my previous post to:</p>

<p>And what if I make my own?
Then I don&#39;t have to pay you anything.
Ha! Checkmate!</p>

<p>Childish? To me it sounds completely rational that I won&#39;t have to pay you if I build my own energy device.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cheap energy is possible, free energy is not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s say, just for the sake of argument, that the device is based upon permanent magnets and that these magnets have to be replaced every 50 years or so. However the device harvest so much energy from the environment that you have the potential to create more magnets so that you can build more devices and replace the old magnets when needed. </p>

<p>Sure, it may cost some to build the device and pay for raw materials, but the energy is still up for graps whenever you need it and can provide you with almost unlimited energy. </p>

<p>Now imagine what would or could happen if we implemented this technology in society: Electric cars could run for 50 years before the magnets would have to be replaced, same thing with our entire energy-grid. The prices on raw materials would totally drop, maybe even disappear comepletely because of the unlimited energy.</p>

<p><strong>Anyway:</strong> If the words &quot;free energy&quot; hurts you so much, then we can also call it unlimited energy, zero-point energy, vacuum energy, revolution energy or everywhere energy. It&#39;s of no importance to me.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it doesnt have much to add to this conversation other then. Even if people don<code>t believe me, I have seen a triangular UFO with my small brother and 2 friends. That flying device had no visible propulsion. Didnt hear any noise, all we could do is stare at it as it pass right over us and faded away in the horizon. What kind of energy could produce enough magnetic force to cancel earth gravity? You need some bad ass technology for that. So If my story is true, this proove science is missing on something big, very big. Because of my story I believe that there</code>s maybe humans who fly these devices and are preventing this information to become public, and so slowing humanity advancement to abundance. This is why I do not trust our government for not releasing this information. Because I know what I saw, I know what it wasn&#39;t (superman, batman, plane, helicopter, paratrooper, birds, ...). It wasnt like any other aircraft I have seen in documentaries, books or videos. So it is either some black secret project from a governmeent agency or it has green aliens inside and comes from outerspace or another dimension, whatever. I preffer the first answer so it means we have already achieved this technology. So If i could show you whats inside my brain you would have proof, but I cant.</p>

<p>To continue on your topic, nikolas tesla was creating a free energy device to distrubute wireless electricity all over earth, but because he couldnt charge people for it, its investor stopped the funding and push to close the project, they had just financed electric dams and didnt want to cut this new income from milking all its users.</p>

<p>I beleive the same thing is happening with free energy devices.</p>

<p>When Skunkworks said they are achieving cold fusion, I think that is a lie, all they want is financing for more toys of war.</p>

<p>Actually it was J. P. Morgan who financed Tesla, but when Morgan found out that Tesla wanted to distribute wireless electricity all over earth Morgan cut his funding. This later meant that Tesla died poor in his apartment of old age. It is then said that FBI or CIA raided his apartment and confiscated some of his notes.   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is the chase. Mostly because inventors/scientists like Eugene Mallove and others have been killed or died under rather suspicious circumstances. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well he did spend some thousans developing the thing. he need to pay bills just like everyone you know. selling this is a normal thing. but he couldnt patent it because the science behind the process. </p>

<p>i did many project with him. transform plastic into diesel and wax. gather wind and solar energy to lit light bubls for third world countries</p>

<p>i dont remember the exact word for the thing. but some kind of cell that absorb light and with some other tech behind he increased the output and you can plug a oven or something like that and it has enough power to work. then u close the loop and it doesnt require any more wall electricity. </p>

<p>a wind propeller so good with magnets it can gather momemtum from almost zero wind. </p>

<p>he sold some of this studf in filipine. thats it so far but hes grtting old and will probably retire soon</p>
