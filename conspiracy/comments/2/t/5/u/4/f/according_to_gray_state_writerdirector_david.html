       You can find those quotes from a Facebook post made by Jordan on January 18th at facebook(dot com)/jordanpagemusic). I can't provide a direct link to FB because Reddit doesn't allow it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who haven't heard, David Crowley, along with his wife and child, were
       <a href="http://m.startribune.com/288947081.html">
        found murdered
       </a>
       in their home January 17th.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Crowley created a concept trailer years ago for a movie he wanted to make called "Gray State," a fictional film about resisting an authoritarian government, presumably the United States, after an economic collapse. You can watch the trailer
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy7FVXERKFE">
        here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The trailer created a ton of buzz in the "liberty community." David's goal was to get funding for the fictional film and create it. If Jordan Page is correct and David had secured the funding from a major Hollywood studio, this is a startling development in this story.

       I knew the man. Deployed with him. Lived in Germany with him. 1-6 Infantry "Regulars". Searching his name today on Reddit brought me here. Crowley would never have done this. I never much bought into conspiracies, but this is too fucking much. Something happened.

       Very sorry for the loss of a good friend and brother-in-arms. Hope you will stay with us on this...we're not all crazy here. There was a time (pre-Army / Army days) when I was not much into conspiracies either (because there was no internet, and like the vast majority of regulars, I had to rely on the MSM for news and info), but it's stories like this (and there are legions) that eventually forces a person to open their eyes, that is, if they are wont to pay attention. That said, keep your head up and eyes open...stay alert, stay alive!

       A large chunk of what is termed conspiracy theory is misinformed, inaccurate, or intentionally misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, some "conspiracy theory" winds up being either correct or relatively close to the truth.

       It really is a very entertaining hobby. I've always loved learning about history since I was a kid, as a hobby. The implications of said learning lead me down the whole "conspiracy" rabbit hole out of the desire to learn the real story behind events with huge implications that are riddled with inconsistencies, things that make you say "really? that's really what happened?" The string of "lone assassins" that have a tendency to kick off world wars and kill important leaders comes to mind.

       Interesting. Looking through
       <a href="https://www.facebook.com/directordavidcrowley">
        his FB
       </a>
       , I see he had been getting very into heavy drinking (of the absinthe, nonetheless). Presuming he was buying domestically legal absinthe, he may have been any run-of-the-mill alcoholic, but depending on whether he is obtaining the "good stuff", he may have been heavy into the depths of a wormwood craze.

       Sad loss, nonetheless. I can't help but wonder if some of the theories regarding personality development being affected by a person's name has some validity, being of unfortunate surname myself.

       Sorry for your loss. Thank you for coming forward. What do you think about the detail from the first officer on scene, mentioning the sliding door being cracked ajar? Also, do you think Crowley would have anticipated being attacked for his work and taken measures to hide whatever threatening data he may have had, or other "dead guy" measures? Thanks, again. Be well, and stay brave.

       I just found out about the door detail from our unit's Facebook group today. I don't know about whether or not he'd have any back up type stuff in case he died, or if he'd really have anything that would have mattered. I just know that this was completely out of character from the man we all served with. Everyone is in shock and there was an almost immediate outcry from those of us that knew him that there was something strange about this, even before the door detail was known. We've probably lost more guys to suicide since being back than we did while downrange, but there's something darker and stranger about this..its just out of character and completely abrupt. I wish I had more to share, I'm sorry.

       Thank you for the reply, and all I can say is try to make sure someone in your group is watching the actions and data and evidence released or withheld by the joint investigating team, and maybe try to have someone familiar with FOIA requests write up some letters for you guys. Thanks for your time, and your service.

       If my wife and children and me wound up dead and the story was "murder suicide", I'd like to think that those that knew me would stand up and say that the man they knew would never harm a hair on his family's head. Crowley deserves that too.

       Hey, sorry guys; I'm not well informed on military "tacticians." Have you seen this man?  Seems legit.  I know a soul when to trust one.  Neither one of you seems to lie; but bear in mind: the monitoring starts now.  Once they see you on this page; all bets are off.  I don't mean to warn you...I'm just sayin'.  The man seemed legit.  I can't imagine a gun to my head than my wife's (I go first, get me).  In any amount of suicide; people don't "just end up dead." Any man takes a gun to his OWN head first.  That's the first thing on your mind.  Familiar with Ted Gunderson?  And please don't get paranoid; that's not the way to go...been there; done that...

       Judging from the trailer this is exactly exactly how I picture what the collapse will be like. Mandatory Rfid chips, resistance groups, riots, suppression of freedom, everything.

       I can understand why they would not want this movie to be made.
 It just goes to show how afraid they are of humanity reaching mass actual awareness.

       <em>
        Dragon Day

       . It's not the same collapse scenario in Gray State, but instead with an invasion of China. Instead of RFID chips, American citizens are forced to wear electronic monitoring bracelets that have the power to track and kill.

       This is the bracelet:

       Alex Jones did a nutjob movie a few years back, I didn't take much credence w it until it made a lot of sense. The elites are going to kill off a bunh of people due to lack of resources and global overcrowding.

       had, then wed have true representatives instead of shills who often don't want us aware of what their voting on...

       Jordan Page seems like an opportunistic piece of shit who's using this tragedy for personal gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to his
       <strong>
        actual
       </strong>
       close friend and Gray State co-producer Mitch Heil, the alleged funding
       <a href="http://www.twincities.com/crime/ci_27343442/three-bodies-found-apple-valley-home">
        didn't pan out.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are lots of compelling reasons to take this murder/suicide at face value and stop trying to turn it into something it's likely not:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Crowley withdrew from friends in October after his business
       <a href="https://twitter.com/bulletexchange">
        The Bullet Exchange went defunct.
       </a>
       <br/>
       • He had angry investors demanding their money back or Gray State produced (if it turns out to be a triple homicide, this is where I'd start looking).
       <br/>
       • Gray State: the Rise suffered a massive setback do to a
       <a href="http://wtfrly.com/2015/01/19/writer-family-fema-camp-movie-gray-state-dead-in-murder-suicide/">
        catastrophic hard drive failure.
       </a>
       <br/>
       • Possible PTSD from tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
       <br/>
       •
       <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/south/289100411.html">
        He left a suicide note.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is before we turn a possible child murderer into a martyr, let's use some common sense and let all the facts roll in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Added Twitter link and started a meta-thread about this
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2t6lso/meta_post_lets_talk_about_the_apparent/">

       Your "didn't pan out" link doesn't actually mention anything about the funding not panning out. Also, where is the information about his bullet exchange business going defunct?
      </p>
      <p>
       The suicide note doesn't apparently explain the suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       His friends and family do not describe any common symptoms of PTSD. The same friends who mention his withdrawal in October mention it was his common tendency to do so while working.
      </p>
      <p>
       The catastrophic hard drive failure doesn't seem to have done more than slow his workflow and release dates back. It's a stretch to simply assume that it is also a contributing factor to his murdering his family and himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt an angry fan funder would eschew a likely hugely popular lawsuit against a fake truther for fraud over outright triple homicide and its corresponding personal risks to the rest of one's assets.

       The note's contents haven't been released yet, only a couple people know what was said.

       I never said he had PTSD, I simply suggested you should consider the possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, you seem to have your mind already made up on this, so I'll just assume all my words are falling on deaf ears. You can believe what you want, no matter how unfounded it may be.

       This article mentions Rise was not lost to a catastrophic HD failure, but was in fact due for impending release in 2-3 weeks, along with new trailers for the film.
      </p>
      <p>
       This email mentioned here has important context to consider when appraising its value in authentically illustrating Crowley's emotional landscape. It was written to a prospective partner. Which means Crowley could have been pitching all this to him. It wouldn't be the first time a small time director attempted to lick boots of a producer, making them out to be a hero for rescuing the film from utter disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to see more definitive proof of the funding details and status of the film than an email pitch to a prospective partner. Thanks for the article, though.

       Wake up millions? Please, One movie isn't going to undo decades of brainwashing and willful ignorance. This whole ordeal reads psyop to me. Looks like a great way to send a message to conspiracy theorist(people who question and go looking for this kind of thing) and misdirect them. Keep your eye on the shiny RFID chips and FEMA camps while we go about business as usual.

       At the same time, they would actually try to suppress anything trying to bring the public the deep truth, right? Like just making obvious to the public that we live in a police state is something TPTB would like to avoid, would they not?  These things you list aren't mutually exclusive.

       I didn't mean the list to be mutually exclusive. I was only pointing out that things the conspiracy community tend to fear already have practical counterparts, and focusing too much on a specific thing might make one miss the overall trend.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        $30 million budget from major Hollywood studio
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is less than the budget allocated for
       <em>
        The Interview
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no industry site supports that claim about the budget for
       <em>
        Gray State
       </em>
       from any major, Hollywood studio.  This claim is only found on alleged liberty sites and they are merely repeating Crowley's claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything should be questioned including those sites with unsubstantiated claims and blatant speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it is actually possible that Crowley did commit murder-suicide when his claims about that budget were discovered to be untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, the coroner is now reporting Crowley and his family may have been dead for weeks.

       Regardless of what happened, the Crowley family is asking people to help contribute to a fund to raise money for Komel's mother, who is in the hospital with cancer. It's worth clicking to read the message from David's brother, Dan.

       It's great that the film exposes the increasing police state, however, there is an agenda behind the movie, particularly the documentary about the production as almost all of the actors/guests (alex jones and his many supporters) in it all promote anarcho-capitalism. For anyone that doesnt follow alternative economic models, this red-herring is another false solution that leads right back to crony capitalism inevitably. Knowing these facts, I am a bit suspicious/critical about this movies intents.

       i didn't know he was able to get money for the movie,

       edit: after reading another post, maybe he didn't get money

       i was worried about the source of funding,

       what i ask myself:
       <em>
        shouldn't

       he have been concerned? if he was able to write a movie based on NWO conspiracy, why accept money from

       He was just about to release the documentary 'Gray State: The Rise' for free (this is what the Kickstarter campaign was for.) There is a rough cut that someone put on YouTube after his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the same project as 'Gray State' the major motion picture idea outlined in the concept trailer linked in the OP that, according to his friend Jordan Page, had gotten 30 million in funding from a major Hollywood studio.

       Danny Mason (heavily involved in this project) was a very close friend of mine growing up.  He is a great person, brought up in a great family.  This situation stinks to high heaven, but people suggesting Crowley and Mason were involved in some illuminati conspiracy themselves is grasping at straws that don't exist.

       David was working on two different projects with the name 'Gray State.'
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Gray State, the major motion picture for which he developed the concept trailer in my OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Gray State: The Rise, the documentary he was about to put out for free which contains interviews with people like Alex Jones, Adam Kokesh, Stuart Rhodes, etc that explores the premise fictionalized in the major motion picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones has never tried to get a fiction movie like this made with major studio with a huge budget. Also, Alex already has an army of listeners. If they kill him, Alex becomes a martyr, putting a spotlight on everything he's already said, while David Knight and Paul Joseph Watson fill his shoes, continuing the Infowars operation without him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Practically speaking, nobody knew who David Crowley was. Yet.

       bullocks! alex jones is an insider 100%, all one has to do is research the genesis-abc-disney connection, the molley (former cia, later worked for AJ)- stratfor connection (texas, where stratfor and alex jones are located, is also the most well known for domestic intelligene firms / agencies operating out of). If you still choose to ignore the truth, then look at the old videos where he even said he worked for disney to a police over in the 90's, or the video where Alex attended the patriat street protest where he divided/crushed and conquered it, sending all the organizers of that event asking AJ to explain why he destroyed that movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones undeniably is cointelpro, or whatever new name it is operating under.

       Yes, Molly did work for Stratfor prior to her employment with Jones. But the idea that Jones is somehow connected to Stratfor can be easily be debunked by going through the Wikileaks Stratfor leaked emails to find the only reference to Alex Emerick Jones is that of Stratfor employees making fun of him, as if they don't know him personally (they don't because they aren't affiliated.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the 2nd Amendment rally he hijacked; that's explained pretty easily. The organizers of the event had a long history of antagonizing Jones. They were essentially his personal enemies. So, he hijacked the small rally to show people he was a tough guy. Hardly important. Hardly proof that he's an "insider."

       GCN rents satellite access from a company owned by ABC. You know, so they can be on the radio. GCN is not owned, or affiliated in any way, with ABC/Disney.

       (also take a note of the domestic intelligence work for China she did) included the details which you do not deny, and you are totally fine with the fact that she worked as domestic intelligence/cia/nsa/ etc ?

       Get it straight out of the horses ass, stratfors own website
       <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/about#axzz3PadmQTfh">

       "Stratfor is a geopolitical intelligence firm that provides strategic analysis and forecasting to individuals and organizations around the world. By placing global events in a geopolitical framework, we help customers anticipate opportunities and better understand international developments."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Best-selling author George Friedman founded Stratfor in 1996 to bring customers an incisive new approach to examining world affairs. Under his direction, Stratfor taps into a worldwide network of contacts and mines vast amounts of open-source information. Analysts then interpret the information by looking through the objective lens of geopolitics to determine how developments affect different regions, industries and markets.
Vision
      </p>
      <p>
       Stratfor's vision is to be the most respected provider of predictive intelligence services. Our core philosophy centers on the understanding that transformative world events are not random and are, indeed, predictable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Building on nearly 20 years of experience as the world's premier geopolitical intelligence firm, Stratfor develops constraint-based narratives for key trends around the globe — placing today's events in context and forecasting tomorrow's new developments well before they appear in the headlines."
      </p>
      <p>
       Mollys position in infowars is the perfect position to mine everyones information that visits that website and develop profiles on people given what information you get from there, and what information you share on their forums about your ideas / philosophys / personal information and knowledge.  This shit is a goldmine, she most likely mined information for stratfor and now is doing the same crap with infowars and you are totally fine with that, I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       and lastly for the Genesis to ABC to Disney connection, you need to do more research, i cant spoon feed everything to you, do some of your own research, ther'es more then enough out there, this is the first link off of google

       LOL, Mike Hanson and Alex Jones were on CABLE ACCESS, hence the press pass with  Time Warner Cable on it. My God man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, have you taken the time to go through the Wikileaks Stratfor emails? Didn't think so. They're making fun of Alex Emerick Jones. Are you you thinking those emails were fabricated to make it look like Alex doesn't work with them?
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the AJ shows from the last 2 months, he admitted to being infiltrated, though he did not say it was Stratfor specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what other "fruits" of AJ's is rotten? What else proves he's a dastardly "insider?" He's done more to wake up the masses than anyone else on present-day-earth. How does that serve the insiders?

       And to add insult to injury, there is an agenda behind Gray State - The Rise (the documentary of the films production), has a narrative where all the guests / speakers / actors all criticize the government and all, but if you do some basic background research, all of them support anarcho-capitalism and keep promoting it endlessly, Including all 3 people that you mentioned "Alex Jones, Adam Kokesh, Stuart Rhodes,".
      </p>
      <p>
       When the original film came out, I appreciated the awareness to the growing tyranical police state it was covering but then I also noticed subconsciously that there was an intense amount of fear programmed into the film which had me fear even speaking out as a critic of the shadow government (also taking note of that).  But what worried me most is the connection I drew to the fact that they all support anarcho-capitalism, and that is hard to swallow it as being just a coincidence that they all support it behind the scenes.

       I dont think you know what the implications are of anarcho-capitalism, and the fact that you dont think there is a problem to a greater audience buying into this balloney economic model is not a problem, is a position that is ignorant and frightening at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       pasted from soemthing i wrote up earlier"...the underlying idea they are promoting which is nothing but a ghost chase. Anarcho-capislism inevitably turns right back into crony capitalism, in fact anarcho-capitalism might even be worse then what we have now if it were to be adopted. (unregulated big corporations, no health / bioengineering regulations, complete private security for only those with the money that can afford it with no civil servants otherwise, a society run by mafia's in the open, economic model that would propel the increase of consumptions, more extreme versions of planned obsolescence with little to no recourse, society literally run by oligarchs and greed for uncontrolled profiteering). "
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of corporatocracy with very little to any regulations.  Also the exploitation of the natural eco-systems would be through the roof, there would be almost no possible way to control an explosion of unproportional plundering/raping of natural systems that we depend on to survive ourselves as a species.  We've lost 50% of all other vertebrate species in the last 20 years, possibly that figure could double or triple under anarcho-capitalism. The deforestation of all of our forests would be through the roof, completely unsustainable. The list of endangered species would be unimaginable compared to now, unless they die off faster then they can be restored/maintained which might be another possibility.  Anarcho-capitalism, would fuel consumption on a unprecedented level in society historically never seen before, say goodbye to any hope of sustainability.

Just reading about this story and doing a little research to try to figure out what happened.

       Go through this sub. Every terrorist attack/crazed gunman is a false flag with crisis actors. Every rebel faction is a master work of the CIA planting that they "lost control of". Every time a post online gets moved or deleted it's a coverup or a censoring. Every negative situation you hear about in another country is actually the total opposite, the country is a wonderland of freedom and dollar blowjob tuesdays.

       No no...you're gonna have to do better than a #FiveTwitterWord hashtag here in r/conspiracy. Eg,
       <strong>
        1st
       </strong>
       you might explain your
       <strong>
        poor

       choice of rhetoric which starts with the word 'Every'
       <strong>
        five times
       </strong>
       in your introduction (sounds like some ex-spouses we'd all like to forget)...then we might all cut to the quick a lot quicker here.

       <em>
        book
       </em>
       of nonsensical ramblings or compose a 30 minute documentary (which is primarily loose theories strung together with 5 minutes of spooky music and "experts" yelling about their cause into the camera) with sources that circle back to themselves, or, best case: to some shitty unaccredited university source that either has no peer reviews or was crushed by them 5 minutes after release. YET, because it was even questioned in the first place, is going to give me ball cancer and turn my kids into David Spade's character from PCU. Then, if this "information" gets removed because it's horseshit, It's being censored.

       Again, good writing, but ultimately cheapened by
       <strong>
        all

       -inclusive and ridiculous statements. Entertaining to read, but not meant to be taken seriously...like
       <em>

       (though not "
       <strong>
        all

       <strong>
        everything
       </strong>
       is a conspiracy anymore than we believe that
       <strong>
        everything
       </strong>
       wrong with our lives is someone else's fault, as you stated in the very next sentence in your diatribe:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You have no money because the government is taking it all through taxes, banks are stealing it and the government is backing them up.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That reads like the Tea Party line in a nutshell, but of course it's a lot more complex that that. Most poor and working- and middle-class folks are indeed poorer than they should be because our various governments (local, state, and federal) design laws favorable to the wealthy, which not only allows these economic elites to exploit and oppress the poor and working class, but simultaneously affords the moneyed class an altogether different kind of justice (
       <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8446545.stm">
        here's an example
       </a>
       of how
       <em>

       justice should taste, as compared to what we are actually expected to stomach

       )...and that's just a drop in the barrel (over which We the People are bent). I won't even bother breaking down the banking bamboozle. If you're not angry at Wall Street for all the financial fraud over the years, then you have your head in the sand. Maybe you've made some smart investments and it hasn't directly affected you, and the American taxpayer bailout was merely some ridiculous number tacked onto an already ridiculous national debt. Congratulations on weathering the storm! In any event, since the banks have already squeezed the taxpayers dry, the next time it will be their depositors who will be do the bailing, ie, bailing ALL IN, in an extortionary deal where they either accept something like 8 cents for every dollar on deposit, or else nothing at all. Also, you'll be required to accept that in the form of an electronic number on a debit card forever thereafter, as hard currency will no longer be accepted.

       Yeah...Well I live not far (from here).  This was and Apple Valley couple that lived a few miles away.  I live in Edina.  I know this area and I know couples don't get murdered in there home in that fashion.  he must have been threatened in some way...it's obvious that this was a factor.  I can think of no other response but that.  This beautiful couple met at an army base in Texas.  I don't know that either was employed.  The man and his cast members were on Alex Jones.  I'm well versed in these subjects.  Political assassinations happen.  It's easy for a state to quietly torture a "subject" before he commits suicide.  I've seen that he had boxes of weapons and that he was an "avid" gun enthusiast.  People are running for the hills for a reason.  i understand that none of these are closed groups.  Minnesota is cold.  The weather up here goes from dry to clammy in an instant.  We don't have record amounts of suicide; but we're going to see more.  Conspiracy theories are on the way; part of this could be masonic, I don't know; they have a temple here located near 44th and France.  You should get Jesse up here to do and op-ed piece about this.  This is worrisome because of the cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wait weeks to find the bodies?  No stink?  I'm sorry to say that, but the neighbors should know better.  My own neighbors barely leave their homes; but this is winter.  I also find it funny that there are many higher income homes going up within my own area.  The gentrification starts now.  All I know is that if foreign powers take over; I'll be "one of the few." Don't resist don't surrender; hey come into my home patna'.  if the Russians take over fine; if the Chinese; oh shit!  You guys don't know "Gray State" wasn't just in the military; IT IS the military.  Ferguson was just a rally.  Suspicious bodies were found in that town too (who gets burned to death? What the FUCK!?)  If you are uninformed-stay that way;  Obama "the terrible" is black, so what?  I give no credence to that insult of a man.  If he had real balls he'd give up already; I'm on the list...

       Think of it like a micro movie, you know proof of concept to get funding. I don't think this trailer is like most "big budget" trailers, where they edit and cut in scenes from the film. But then again, I don't know for sure. Makes sense though.

       Do you have any proof other than this photo? This is probably David being silly/ironic, since he was very much awake to the New World Order and Illuminati symbolism. He's posing next to a Transformers poster with one eye, so I'd be willing to bet my house that he was saying "this poster is Illuminati symbolism, check it out," not "I'm with the Illuminati, and you suckers are about to get played."

       That isn't a Transformers' poster, it's a fucking "anti-terror" PSA, encouraging people to report (say something) any suspicious activities they might see (see something). GB was probably one of the first countries to implement the "see something/say something" campaign, but they're doing it in the USA too. Head of the DHS had similar PSA's.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qml7obNdmgk">
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;THIS&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
       </a>
       is one of the PSA's they ran in the USA. They have similar things going on  It's reminiscent of Orwell's novel 1984, where people we're encouraged to report anybody who was against the totalitarian state in the novel. He's throwing up the pyramid to bring attention to the eye, but that's irrelevant as far as I'm concerned. The whole point is the "i'm scared, i'm reporting you to the nanny state...please protect me nanny state" mentality these PSA's promote.

       This is what an ad hominem argument looks like, I'm going to show you how it makes you lose credibility:
      </p>
      <p>
       You: I'm right because I'm right.
Anyone else: no you are not.
You: Yes I am because you are stupid.

       At the same time, they would actually try to suppress anything trying to bring the public the deep truth, right? Like just making obvious to the public that we live in a police state is something TPTB would like to avoid, would they not?  These things you list aren't mutually exclusive.

       I dont think you know what the implications are of anarcho-capitalism, and the fact that you dont think there is a problem to a greater audience buying into this balloney economic model is not a problem, is a position that is ignorant and frightening at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       pasted from soemthing i wrote up earlier"...the underlying idea they are promoting which is nothing but a ghost chase. Anarcho-capislism inevitably turns right back into crony capitalism, in fact anarcho-capitalism might even be worse then what we have now if it were to be adopted. (unregulated big corporations, no health / bioengineering regulations, complete private security for only those with the money that can afford it with no civil servants otherwise, a society run by mafia's in the open, economic model that would propel the increase of consumptions, more extreme versions of planned obsolescence with little to no recourse, society literally run by oligarchs and greed for uncontrolled profiteering). "
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of corporatocracy with very little to any regulations.  Also the exploitation of the natural eco-systems would be through the roof, there would be almost no possible way to control an explosion of unproportional plundering/raping of natural systems that we depend on to survive ourselves as a species.  We've lost 50% of all other vertebrate species in the last 20 years, possibly that figure could double or triple under anarcho-capitalism. The deforestation of all of our forests would be through the roof, completely unsustainable. The list of endangered species would be unimaginable compared to now, unless they die off faster then they can be restored/maintained which might be another possibility.  Anarcho-capitalism, would fuel consumption on a unprecedented level in society historically never seen before, say goodbye to any hope of sustainability.

       So he's a "nutjob" who only "probably" murdered his wife and child? You make it sound like he was a nut regardless.

       Interesting. Looking through
       <a href="https://www.facebook.com/directordavidcrowley">
        his FB
       </a>
       , I see he had been getting very into heavy drinking (of the absinthe, nonetheless). Presuming he was buying domestically legal absinthe, he may have been any run-of-the-mill alcoholic, but depending on whether he is obtaining the "good stuff", he may have been heavy into the depths of a wormwood craze.

       Sad loss, nonetheless. I can't help but wonder if some of the theories regarding personality development being affected by a person's name has some validity, being of unfortunate surname myself.
