       So I just came back from the place and found something in the back covered by a camo tarp. I then saw a mexican man come out, pick something up and go back inside. Earlier in the day I went there and saw a pizza guy trying to deliver a pizza to the place. (They were probably being trolled) He knocked and knocked and nobody came to the door. He left, and I was about to as well until I noticed kids walking up to the door and trying to get in, finally an old mexican lady opened the front door and let them in.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 years of living here, never saw a single person go in or out. Then in one day i see 4 people. Weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       Turns out it was a picnic table under the tarp.

       Could still be a drug front, but perhaps due to the additional attention it's getting they are bringing in some of their kids to make the place look more convincing. Definitely a stretch but who knows what this entity is capable of.

       Not really a stretch. It makes me wonder a lot of things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Where did these kids come from?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Were they unsupervised on a main road?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If not, was there a single chaperone with all the kids or individual parents?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the latter, funny they would all come at the same time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What time did this occur (the children being dropped off)?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If it was in the afternoon, that's interesting as most people drop off their kids in the morning before work and pick them up afterwards.

       Exactly. I went to daycare K-3rd grade after school. I got out at 3:00 PM, but my mom wasn't off work and back in our town until around 4:30ish.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just odd the two little girls were seen without a chaperone of some sort.. Generally there is a check-in and/or check-out for kids at pre schools and daycares.

       Afternoon isn't strange. There are a lot of laws that surround how long a child can stay at an establishment. If you have a daycare and children stay there all day you make yourself subject to state inspection. But if the kids stay half the day you can dodge it (depending on what state).
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a certain time that the place accepts children being "dropped off" then that would explain why the kids show up at the same time. I know of a daycare that has a window to drop your kids off and then essentially locks the door so nobody can come in while they watch your kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most alarming and telling piece of evidence would be a lack of adult supervision. If the children are unaccompanied by an adult I would find that very suspicious.

       Could the kids have come from school?
      </p>
      <p>
       If any of the schools there have those "staggered" schedules like they do in some communities, there could be kids that start very early, like 7 AM, but they get out at 1 or 2. If their parents work till 5 or 6, it's not unusual for the younger ones to go to a day care or after-school program of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are other kids there inside, one would hope the lady wouldn't just leave the door to the place unlocked.

       This is exactly what I was thinking. It would explain why all the artwork never changes, why they're so secretive, and why the place is still running.  It's pretty close to Mexico yet far away enough that no one would suspect anything. Plus, the owners appear to be Hispanic.

       My guess, based on the alleged Air Force linguist, is that it may be a front for a military program. Perhaps layered; for example, a linguistics research facility fronting as a drug house, fronting as a daycare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind you, this is all wild speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may even be a government safehouse or listening post for operatives in the SLC area. From what I understand there is a significant community of Persian Americans (Iranians) in SLC, and given the claimed languages spoken (generally central asian) by DeathShip (assuming his accounts are factual), it wouldn't be unreasonable to infer that his work with the Air Force was related to monitoring communications in central Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, if this is in fact the case, the general public will remain in the dark about it, given the nature of operations that could be presumed to be related to the facility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       I'd be careful if I were you.  I'm not threatening you (I'm just some fedora neckbeard redditor following this thread) but if they (being the people running this "daycare") find out that you live nearby, and are contributing to this thread, it puts you on a very short list of people who live within a close enough radius to observe the daily goings-on.  I'm certainly not trying to silence you, I'm just wondering if you fear for your safety at all?

       OK, so you all think this place is a front for something illegal.  You say you haven't seen any kids, but guess what.....kids came to the door and they let them in.  The person letting them in......an elderly hispanic lady.  And that thing that everyone was freaking out about being hid under the "camo" tarp ended up being a picnic table.  So...has anyone actually seen anything illegal happening at this place?  Anyone???  Please leave these people alone.  You are making a big deal out of NOTHING!!!  The only people who are going to suffer are the kids who are attending this daycare.  And yes, there are actually kids attending this daycare and I would guess that you people are scaring the crap out of them and the people who run this place.

       <em>
        (user requested his name be removed) says, "I just talked to my friend who lived right be there for about a year and said one night they jimmied their way in out of curiosity and in the main room was mostly just a chair facing a TV displaying a live video of the other room in the building."
       </em>
       He also adds,
       <strong>
        "The laundromat across the street constantly has cops there for drug busts."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The daycare is most likely a cop stakeout for surveillance on the laundromat.

       If this was some Mexican cartel place, I doubt they would have people on reddit making sure no one talks about it.

       I personally really, really doubt that the most fitting explanation is that the cops set up a fake business, and have been paying rent on a building disguised as a day care for many years, solely to watch 1 laundromat.

       Do all of their TVs at the station have to be broken for this theory to work?

      <p>
       Depends on the number of busts in the laundromat.  If they average 2 or 3 busts a week, then paying rent would absolutely be a cash cow for that police department and worth it.  But if they only make 1 bust a month there, then it wouldn't be worth the rent.

       Extremely insightful and relatable to this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've worked in child-care centres before and (to add to your helpful points
       <a href="/u/hangipants">
        /u/hangipants
       </a>
       ) I think a small, yet main aspect of this is the lack of children's name tags on the bag hanging area, both inside, and what seems to be another bag/locker area for children (Near the back door, blue shelving).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never seen a facility for small children not take up this simple, and cheap practice. There is no reason they would not have this, if the centre was providing care for children.

       Working in the social field myself, can confirm - even though I'm not familiar with US regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note also the flag in the larger window to the left of the door - it seems to have fallen down in the time from '11 to '14. Kinda hard to believe that in a time span of ~three years nobody would go out of their way to pick up or reattach an item come loose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, if I worked in any kind of care institution, hell, in any kind of business, I'd have this cleaned out the minute I noticed it.

       Of course, and it would be the most logical explanation. No way to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But judging from the other windows, where (presumed) child drawings
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been hanging for three years, it might not be too much of a stretch to assume the flag has been down for a while. Then again, they of course could've 're-hanged' said pictures in that time span. Who knows?

       It is obvious that the last picture you are showing is a meth lab.  You can see the keypad above the doorswitch that opens the secret room behind the tree that has the "owl" peering out.  Very obvious illuminati drug operation going on here.

       That's a bad front to launder money though.  The way to.launder money is to have a business that is cash and doesn't have customers that can be easily identified.  That way the owners can massively inflate the number of customers and what they purchased so that they can claim high earnings when in reality there was little to none.  A daycare is no good because they are highly regulated, have limited numbers of customers, has easily identifiable customers, and is most likely not a cash business.

       When you start a company (whether it's a corporation, LLC, DBA), you are required to pick a state to incorporate in. You must file the proper documents for that state and these documents are typically public record. Most states allow these documents to be searched on their government websites. Some of them (like Utah) allows you to do a principal search, meaning you can look up all companies who have have founders/officers with the names you are interested in (for example "Eva Solano") for that state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "registered agent" is the person who is the point of contact for the corporation (typically for legal reasons). Most people make themselves the registered agent (instead of paying an outside company), so this is one way to get data. If someone wanted to sue the company or take other action, they would need someone to serve these documents to, as corporations themselves are not physical entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the tech side, when you register a domain (.com, .net, etc) you will fill out personal information as to who it is registered to. This is not "required" and often times domain services will default to the information you used to sign up for the domain to begin with. This information is publicly available via WHOIS lookup.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other websites that offer business data lookup, which is public record. They are just aggregators of this data and make it easier to search (typically crawling and caching it themselves, similar to Google).

       All of it seems really weird to me.

       I can give a reasonable explanation to the 29:32 issue. They may be licensed for 29 children a day, but have some part time (3 or 4 days a week) spots. Therefore, you could end up with more spots than your total capacity number.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I run a childcare facility that is licensed for 90 but we serve approx. 110 families.

       Thank you for the work. It's obvious Eva and Ava are the same person. Jose is involved in local government and they are using this building to hide something. I'm guessing it's more for drugs than anything. The laundry across the street is apparently " constantly filled with cops on drug bust"  I'm thinking this building is being used to distribute incoming shipments to the area.

       I don't think it's the same guy. The FB profile in question seems to be of a construction worker in the Dominican Republic with a pretty banal life. It says he went to HS in salt lake city, thus that explains his "lives in". Its probably 'cool' for him to put he lives in America on his profile.

       I think I found a link to Karen Yocom's Facebook. She lives in Utah and is self employed at "Topham's Tiny Tots" (sounds like another name for a daycare?) and also has what appears to be a husband by the name of Richard. Coincidence?

       profile on Utah's government site. Seems to be registered to "E. Gregg Tobler" back in 1977, continuously renewed and in good standing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I don't believe the Yocoms to be involved in any of this. Seems like they started their own business in 1973, eventually selling it to the Solanos in 2003. That's probably where it went downhill and became what it is now. Likely they got it on the cheap and could piggyback of the community reputation of "a good daycare" to keep up appearances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tobler (or associates) might be old friends with the Yocoms and offered her a job for what she has many years experience in. Considering this company has been continuously registered for nearly 40 years, it does not come across as suspicious.

       A probable reason for the evasive website/domain changes seems to me to be that the individuals listed in the WHOIS started getting hugged too hard by Reddit and thus changed their information in a hurry hoping that people would leave them alone.

       Noticed that myself. There all seem to be just standard search-engine landing pages. Being that he's the webmaster of SLCGOV.com, he's probably familiar with squatting domain names. Some domain services allow you to monetize this with ads or other things, so he may be doing that.

       Most of it comes down to knowing what documentation has to be filed for starting a business (and renewing it), as well as how the internet and domains work (WHOIS, DNS, IP addresses, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other sites which aggregate this data and make it easy to search. Many of them crawl the web and cache it so it is difficult for them to remove it in attempts to cover their tracks.

       If the guy's actually a mailman, then what's the purpose of posting that? If he always comes at, say roughly 2PM, what's the point of saying that it's always nap time.? Maybe he comes there in a span of a few hours or changed his route slightly so he went there at a different time. Or maybe he's not actually a mailman. I wanna believe though

       Yeah, if it's the same mail carrier. If there's someone replacing her then it may vary (this goes for both my mom's house and my dad's house which are located in way different parts of the city of Philadelphia). But obviously the POV was from 1 single mail carrier and I've read in the few different places this comment was brought up that their mail gets delivered around the same time as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's been noted that other people have said their child's daycare has either staggered or multiple nap times per day.
      </p>
      <p>
       What sticks out to me more than multiple naps is that some people are saying they've never seen any kids in or around it and then someone happened to snap pics of 2 yesterday, and the place is still getting violations as if it's fully functioning. That's what doesn't add up to me. The mail carrier's observation isn't close to disturbing compared to these shipping details and business owners.

       I mean I'm not saying that there is definitely some conspiracy I just think that the mail carrier anecdote doesn't sound completely false to me. My mail time isn't different everyday, but it certainly varies for weeks at a time. Ex: I'll get it around 11 for a couple weeks, then around two for a week, then maybe around ten for a couple weeks

       That's weird haha the only people that don't show up like clockwork (unless it's a sub for our normal lady) are package deliveries that aren't USPS. I wish I could get more people to weigh in here. Maybe Philly just has their shit together on something for once haha.

       Also, I uncovered this-
      </p>
      <p>
       I googled the phone number to the daycare and It showed the name to Fun Time Kidcare. Same name as the other weird place, just not the exact same with spelling. Only difference is, it's a new address.
Come to find out that it's been operating since '07. One year after the creepy daycare went out of business. Now it gets weird when you find out both business share the same number. The same number that hardly anybody picks up and when they do it a guy with broken english telling me that its for low income families only and that I need to go through the Dept. Of Workforce services.
Why do they share the same number? Why does the guy tell me something completely different?

       Or it just screams trolling. With regard to the personal reddit messages, imagine how juicy it is for someone to troll something like r/conspiracy threads with msgs like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the threat had come with evidence of some kind of proof of information rather than just "we know who you are" i would say it was different. IF they sent him his adress and maybe the adress of family members perhaps... stuff like that.

       You should contact the police and tell them everything that's happened. If they choose not to investigate it, well then we know they're in on whatever's going on and have been for some time.

       I don't think that would be a bad idea, for reasons which are becoming more obvious as more of this unfolds. But, if the police don't take it seriously, it could just as easily be because they've never heard of "some website called Reddit that the youngin's seem to be using".  I suggest, if the OP
       <a href="/u/blink_and_youre_dead">
        /u/blink_and_youre_dead
       </a>
       does decide to contact the police, that he not simply call them, but also email, making sure to include everything that a publicly releasable chain of emails would need to include to involve, and possibly implicate, the local police department.

       Wha?? You shouldn't mention Reddit at all. Lol. Just say they sent you messages over the internet, present all the evidence found from public records, and then of course the building itself.

       I don't think it matters if the OP mentions reddit or not. They'll ask him about that anyways. So that's a moot point as far as I'm concerned.

       It's still important how you present yourself, as you pointed out. They might inquire which internet forum you were using or how the messages were sent, at which point you'd of course reply Reddit. But you can't start by saying, "Hi, I was browsing
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and I duhduhduhduhduh."

       True...but in the OP's case they didn't start out by browsing
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . And, when it comes time to talk about that, I would think this particular OP has the ability to explain that in a way that, if all this communication is by email, therefore able to be reposted publicly, will make their use of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       seem reasonable, if not the most rational recourse. Especially given the recent fact that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       seems to be the last recourse of things, laughably, deleted from
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being that reddit as a whole seems to be taking
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       more seriously lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, you're right, I wouldn't start my conversation with the police out with "So, like, I was on r/conspiracy, and then this happened..." but I don't think the OP will do that. They seem to more intelligent than that.

       If you turn over the name DynCorp in your research, cross reference it with child trafficking. I have no idea if they have anything to do with it, but I've heard a few weird stories over the years about shell games regarding contract child care.

       They look like they could be two phone numbers. I don't have the nerve to try calling the numbers to see what comes up, and I don't know why they'd include two phone numbers in that vaguely threatening message anyway.

       913 in a Kansas area code but the rest of it is not a phone number. The other is a dead end as well. However, both 595 and 598 (the beginning and ending of the first number) are country codes to Uruguay and Paraguay, respectively.

       So my head went to RFID in reverse but RFID tags are 24 digit numbers. Maybe it's gematria?

       I also thought Gematria, especially considering the signed initials "F.R." Now, I'm pretty certain it can't be only Gematria, there would have to be another cipher/equation/translation involved.
       <br/>
       Each 10 digit number as a sum is too large for translation, and using the single digit to letter method is looking to be gibberish, in direct English conversion.

       Drug dealers aren't that smart? Maybe at street level nut those high up guys are smart as fuck. You cant smuggle kilos of heroin and coke into the country, then distibute it, and not get caught if you aren't smart.

       I think the threats are from trolls. Why would the people responsible make themselves known, and intentionally give out potential clues in the form of strings of numbers and initials?
      </p>
      <p>
       Deathship, however, is an interesting character. He may or may not be lying about his background. But I am definitely sure he is not involved in this business, but based on past experiences has a pretty good feeling it's dangerous. He seems like a pretty cool dude who isn't working for or against anyone in this. If he is telling the truth about his background, he's a good person to have going forward.
      </p>

       I think the kids going in and out is the interesting part. Maybe they're being used? Are they transferring something?

       Even though I think the threats were from trolls because it's stupid to give away potential clues when you're trying to stop people investigating, this would mean that the numbers translate to the botanical name of a plant.

       We should look into cracking the code. It is likely an illegal plant, marijuana or something similar, if we operate under the possibility that it is a sort of drug front. I'm not one for working out such a code, anyone want to help?

       Alternatively, it could be thought of as a threatening signature. Consider the vast number of deadly plants (with nice sounding nicknames to boot) that would make for a nice "I am the Angel of Death" salutation.

       I think that may be a little too Hollywood-esq,  but it makes more sense than any hint at a drug in a warning.

       I definitely remember receiving numbers like that before and being intrigued enough to try Googling them for a few minutes. I just can't for the life of me recall where I saw them. And I must have been private browsing cause it's not in my search history. I'll keep looking.

       I did and they didn't know anything about it. Told me to call another number (forgot the name.) This company said that they were listed but the daycare is spelt "Fun Time Kids Care" as apposed to "Fun Time Kidz Kare"
      </p>
      <p>
       She told me the only way I could enroll a child is to first enroll my kid at the daycare then get back to them. I told her the owner of the building said I can't do that and go through Workforce services first. At this point she said she didn't know anything about that and couldn't help me anymore.

       First thing I noticed being "off" is on this listing, their hours end at 5:30 but apparently the group of children that were seen to arrive (not clear if they had any adult supervision getting to the daycare) knocked on the door to get in in the afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some replies indicated most day cares take children after school until evening, but 5:30 seems a little early for that?

       Anyone else think the author of those messages might not be a native english speaker?  Some of the phrasing and punctuation is awkward and not what you'd expect someone fluent in the language to use.
       <br/>
       Examples:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Delete your post and comments, and stop making questions.
        <br/>
        "If you must continue your search. Try to uncover what you seek do not say I didn't warn you. Things like this are always ran by dangerous people."
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       This, combined with the reports from other users ITT adds some weight to the idea of some sort of foreign-run, under-the-radar type business going on there...

       While I agree with you that it is a bit rash to dismiss your claims on being in the Air Force and speaking 8 languages and all that based solely on your interests, your comments implying that you know what's going on in that daycare and that it's dangerous are relatively unbelievable.  You've provided no evidence that you know what's going on, and as such your claim holds no more weight than any claim I make, such as "Aliens abducted me, when I was on their ship I saw Snoo.  Snoo was the leader.  Reddit was made by aliens.".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really know what's going on in there, I'd encourage you to tell us, even anonymously.  Hop on to a VPN, make a throwaway, and give us some details backed by data and/or some pictures at least.

       You did advise the people on the original thread to stop looking, though I must have gotten your post confused with some of the others in there that did claim to know.  Regardless, what was your reasoning for advising people to stop digging?

       i dont know about that. if he was into human trafficking, who is to say he cant be on reddit as well. criminals use the internet too. this is the only reason he saw the post so quickly, how else would they catch the post so fast. also the fact the there were tons of follow up sketchy posts from new user that immediately delete there accounts gives it some legitimacy.

       Listen, they're not going to kill you. It would be too damn obvious that after you started doing some digging you passed away. It's probably best if you let some people you know in real life know about what's going on too. They wouldn't do anything to risk getting exposed, this ins't a movie.

       After school day care? Kids walk from school to the daycare because their parent(s) are at work.  A lot of people in this thread seem to be lacking a bit of perspective. When you are poor a lot of sacrifices have to be made.

       A lot of times day cares have buzzers / remote locks for the doors so if they don't know the person or aren't expecting someone they won't be buzzed in. So maybe they didn't order the pizza??

       Maybe someone on here ordered a pizza to the place so that they could see if someone opened the door to receive it instead of knocking themselves? Also it does look like those kids know/trust the person that let them in. They look old enough to not enter somewhere if they don't know the person letting them in/ haven't been there a bunch of times before.

       Edit: I just looked again, and hadn't realized there was more than 1 picture. Pretty much how my day's been going. Great job in taking those, thanks. You're right, it does look like it could function as a day care. Aside from the bare shelves.

       It looks like the bare shelves are coat hangers and cubbies. That said, whatever you see from this moment on will not be the normal activity since it's gained enough attention.

       Agreed. The place def looks creepy, but could just be a sad day care center and this whole day has been wasted on a psy-op myth to distract us from a real predator like Jeffrey Epstein, who today had his lawyers file a desperate appeal to keep his non-prosecute filing sealed.

       I'm not entirely sure because they were posted on 8chan's /baphomet/ and the poster was anonymous. There was this pizza guy who banged on the door, peeked through windows and even tried the back door. Anon said that a few seconds after the dude left these two girls appeared and this woman let them in.

       That is indeed weird as hell then cuz if things did happened in that order, it seems to mean that the pizza guy's knock was not answered on
       <em>
        purpose
       </em>
       , while the girl's knock
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       answered and they were let in.  One has to wonder why that is...

       The pics I got of the interior are to the left of the front door from the sidewalk. There are windows to the right side of the door but they looked to be more covered and I didn't want to snoop too much and invade anyone's privacy. The windows to the left could be seen into reasonably and didn't make me feel like some peeping Tom. Anyone walking by could have looked in there reasonably and not been hassled about a violation of privacy.

       A certain previous owner has "Female Sex Workers" as his only interest on facebook. Have not confirmed if this is a legit page but it seems like it.

       He hasn't been a co-owner since ~2003-2005. The person who commented on the thread claiming their kids went there (it was a new account) said they only liked it until "Mr. Richard" left. Also he has other interests listed, but maybe that's been in the past day (since you posted your comment)

       Here's the thing. It may look as though this proves legitamacy, but let's not forget that the business was registered to a Government Official. So he may have inside info. As in, knowing when the inspections happen.

       Documentation of orientation training cannot be located for Jose Solano. This rule was previously found to be out of compliance on 3/8/07, 4/30/07 and 2/8/08. This rule must be in compliance by April 20, 2008. If this rule is not in compliance by April 20, 2008, an additional civil money penalty of $50 will be assessed.

       They do provide day-care, they have to keep up the front.  But the guy in city hall keeps the wheels greased so the place doesn't actually close.  I posted a comment further down that, if this is a drug front, it would make sense that the kids that have been seen here are just the children of friends and family that distribute the drugs, hence why they don't care about training, sanitation, etc.  They're all friends &amp; work together and this place just keeps an eye on their kids while they're out doing it.  I mean, better than just leaving them at home I guess.

       They provide it, technically. With a total capacity of 29 and "32" vacancies... at a facility of that "caliber", I'm inclined to believe otherwise.

       Day care fraud is very much a thing, as are shell companies and fronts for illicit activities. The fact that it is run by someone employed by the city is also interesting.

       Even if it is a sad, creepy, legit daycare... I don't believe they are running it to code standards. What kind of care are these children

       I think it is reasonably possible that this is some kind of underage sex dungeon.  The exterior sure fits the bill as an attraction for pedophiles.  No clue if it is related to the Mormons.

       Someone who claimed to have broke into the place in the past said all they saw was a chair, in front of a TV, with a live feed into another room. Just thought I should point that out. Obviously no way  to prove that what the user said was actually true, but it fit's the creepiness quota that story seems to require.

       If you scroll through the comments I've explained and given examples of how daycare/fake child scams operate. Honestly running a legit daycare across the street from where drug busts routinely take place is a pretty poor business decision. Most people don't want to drop the kids off somewhere where they might get shot. I know when I was daycare shopping I skipped everything in the hood.

       Yeah I saw a couple of them. The fact that if it was for money laundering and there is a laundrymat across the street is just amusing. If it's
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       to be for drug busts, I doubt people go near it anymore. It does seem fairly 'new' to me in the pictures so if it's a legit daycare that sucks for them.

       I would say it's more like saying Picard wasn't the captain of the Enterprise 1701-A.  He may have been on the 1701-D and even the 1701-E for that matter, but he was still on the Enterprise.  You should check out more info on Joseph Smith's child brides that the Mormons put out.  Warren Jeffs was just a different captain on a Galaxy Class starship.  It's called fundamentalist for a reason.

       That would be my first inclination. If he had actually worked at the Groom Lake test facility (a.k.a. Area 51) he would have signed a non-disclosure agreement. Anyone who signs such an agreement would not so readily violate it out of risk of losing their job and facing severe legal repercussions. He claims to speak eight languages, yet at no time did he provide proof to support this claim, nor did he make any supporting comments to suggest he is remotely credible. Considering the prevalence of trolls on reddit, on the Internet in general, that would appear to be the most likely explanation. It's still technically possible he could be part of some nefarious coverup, it just isn't nearly as probable of a scenario.

       I'm not so sure. But mostly because my hypothesis and assumption is that the location is a government operated facility of some sort; possibly a safehouse or listening post.

       You bring up:

      <blockquote>

        would have signed a non-disclosure agreement

       But I will remind that it is claimed he was "questionably discharged." Maybe he was a liability who wasn't tight lipped enough for his assignment. Especially if he worked in intelligence, which Air Force linguists do (tracking foreign communications).

       There will be very clear lists of people who have ever so much as legally set food upon Area 51, let alone been discharged. By revealing that information you are probably, what, 1/10 people max? No way you'd do it.

       Do you mean revealing that one worked at "Area 51?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it's not that secretive, it's been a publicly acknowledged facility for years, and is an aircraft testing site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like any base it would have cooks, guards, quartermasters, maintenance crews, etc. Cheyenne mountain is more secretive than Groom Lake AFB.

       Except there's tons of literature on projects that occurred there that were written by people who in fact WERE employees.

       The age isn't the fundamentally relative quality. It's the fact that they're declassified. If the poster worked on something that has since been declassified, I see no reason he couldn't talk about his/her service at Groom Lake.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's moot anyway, because people disclose classified information all the time, regardless of how high profile the pertinent entity or project is.

       After reading through his history, he says he graduated high school in 2009. He says he learned all of those languages at the Defense Language Institute. At most, he is 24 years old. It was 11 months ago when he talked of working at Area 51 and also that he was no longer in the military at that time. So that means he couldn't have done more than one 4 year term in the military. I find it highly unlikely that a recruit fresh out of high school would gain enough clearance to have worked at Area 51 in just 4 years. Just my two cents.

       Become a linguist, instant TS clearance. Pass the DLAB over a 150 your going to take a trip to some places (that's all I am going to say.) My brain is wired for languages. Can I read all of them? no, Can I speak them, yes. I have an audio graphic memory It is very easy for me to remember words and things that are verbally said with 94% recall. I am white.I am not Hindi or Pakistani I grew up in Vermont. Moved to utah in my late high school years. Graduated early with pakets. joined the Airforce at 17years old. I was not stationed at A51 I was only there for like a week. (Can not say anymore than that) Am I involved in this day care stuff? No, Hell no. Its just In my experience From what I was doing after the USAF. These places are bad news. Its easy to identify when something is up. no one walking in or out of the doors, lack of change for decades, etc. and since the thread I have done my own research. as for the people calling me a phoney because I am 24 and I bothered to actually seize the opportunities that were in front of me learned those languages went to A51 and jumped out of airplanes for a living for 4 years doesn't mean it isn't possible. I have seen some seriously fucked up shit, It wasn't a cake walk. DLI,Jump school, S.E.R.E school, and Goodfellow AFB. did someone fuck up my DD214? I think so but I have to go to DC with a Lawyer to have a chance at that to get changed.

It would be much easier for someone to learn these languages since they have alot of shared stuff.

       It's not uncommon for regular Indian folks to speak 4-5 languages, since many are closely related. That lends a tad more credibility to his claim of speaking 8 languages, compared to if he'd listed 8 totally unrelated languages.

       Urdu uses cognates from other languages like Farsi and Arabic most people who speak Hindi may understand Urdu but are unable to read it or understand a few words. For instance the word for family in Urdu is خاندان "Khandan" But in Hindi it is परिवार "Parivāra" most can understand each other. Also Urdu is kind of a bitch because it is not that standardized. in Punjab they may use more Hindi based Urdu where as in Baluchistan your going to get a lot of Farsi in there. they are not the same language but they are very close to each other. Urdu is a hindi based language due to its grammatical structure simple words are going to be the same but the more specified the words like medical terminology is going to be Farsi. religious colloquialisms are going to be arabic.

       They really aren't. At the very least there are huge dialectic differences aside fro. the cultural connotations. Indians say they speak Hindi and Pakistanis say they speak Urdu. Try and convince either that they're speaking the other and see what happens.

       I disagree, as an Indian. In fact I made a throwaway account just for that. Indian languages are not so closely related - and the languages u/DeathShip mentioned are definitely not so closely related.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely, if he is from India/Pakistan then Hindi-Urdu and English are almost given. But Punjabi, Bengali and Balochi are very different languages to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case: I know Hindi/Urdu and can understand Punjabi as well. I'd challenge DeathShip to prove that he speaks these languages.

       :D
Just as I expected!
      </p>
      <p>
       So I just went to Google Translate, and typed:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I will not play your games"
and translated it into Hindi and Urdu.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally it gave what you wrote me:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hindi:
       <a href="https://translate.google.com/#en/hi/I%20will%20not%20play%20your%20games">
        https://translate.google.com/#en/hi/I%20will%20not%20play%20your%20games
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Urdu:
       <a href="https://translate.google.com/#en/ur/I%20will%20not%20play%20your%20games">
        https://translate.google.com/#en/ur/I%20will%20not%20play%20your%20games
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Except that there is one problem, buddy. It's wrong :) 
(As usual, Google translate is not 100% perfect)
      </p>
      <p>
       You wrote: Meh apni khale nehe khalunga.
Should be: Main aapke khel nahi khelunga.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Urdu, you wrote: Main aapke khel nahin khelenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       which is once again wrong: (should be same as Hindi translation)

       Please stop being phony :)

       Actually, kind of makes sense. A linguist in the military is generally assigned to tasks pertaining to monitoring the communications of foreign origin. The US has an interest in central Asia, given the rise of militant Islamic groups, and our state's distrust of Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, German makes sense, too, as the Air Force has presence at five locations in Germany, and due to Germany's major role in NATO.

       As mentioned, there are non-disclosure agreements about working at Area 51. However, as it is linked to UFOs and similar topics, I think it was meant to bring out the UFO buffs like myself in order to change the subject. Since it failed, we can continue to focus on this "daycare" facility and see what really goes on there.

       I'm not so certain.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be an attempt to troll the UFO angle, but I have an alternate hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Air Force is responsible for communications intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Air Force maintains many bases in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US Gov't has reasons to monitor central Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       These facts lend plausibility to the idea that there would be an individual in the Air Force with knowledge of the languages listed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, The claim that DeathShip worked at "Area 51" is pretty broad. He may have been assigned there for linguistic intel work unrelated to the other classified programs operating there, or maybe his work WAS there, and he had discipline issues with confidentiality; hence his "questionable discharge" rather than honorable discharge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, my hypothesis is that the building is some sort of government facility, maybe a listening post, maybe a safehouse, who knows. But I think it's a plausible angle to consider, given the uncanny nature of the property, and the apparent secrecy surrounding it.

       I actually went into probably 12 pages of his comment history, which no one else seems to have done. (i wasted so much time..) Anyways, his comment history describes work place experience at best buy, subway, and a coffee shop. Also, the only language he says he knew within the last two years was Urdu, again, according to the comment history. He also has a really long series of comments discussing demonolpgy that stopped abruptly. This comment is probably going to get buried but I thought it would help.

       Yes. As soon as someone brags about having worked at Area 51 their credibility drops through the floor and ends up in the basement somewhere. I wouldn't even trust a recipe for bean dip from Deathship after that.

      <p>
       The Air Force specializes in communications intelligence; I think the claims are plausible.

       if you scroll up to the very top of the thread where another redditor has posted some pictures of children going in, followed by a different redditor later posting pictures of what appears to be a policeman looking around, I think that'd show the chances are increased exponentially as to this being the correct answer to this situation

       Jen has 5 kids. She tells the state she has a minimum wage job, so she needs them to give her money for child care.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say, alright, well, lets see the proof you have this job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her friend Tony has a business, he cuts her checks each week as if she works there, but she doesn't. Maybe she gives it back to him, who knows. But she shows the checks to the state who eventually says, alright, this is legit, you make so little that you qualify for 200$ per kid per week to pay for child care, let us know who to give it to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last person in the scam is Linda. She runs "Day Care 666", which is not real. Jen tells the state that she sends her kids to Day Care 666, and the state cuts Linda 200$ a week per kid that goes there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only Linda's not really watching the kids, so she's just netting 1000$ a week for nothing (maybe they're just with their mom or something).
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see how with a few different people in on it, this could become VERY lucrative. My little example with only 20 kids would be netting 4000$ a week, that's $208,000 a year.

       As someone who had lived in SLC for a lot of my childhood, I can say that the place is riddled with pedophiles. High ranking Mormons are notorious for sex scandals. I remember an ex-Mormon bishop who lived across the street from me. My Dad found out that he had been taking a "bath" with my dog. He would also lay naked on his front porch and watch us play, in the excuse that he was tanning. Fuck that guy, seriously. I also needed to go into "stranger danger" mode more than once in my time living there. It is a fucked up place, and the creepy,  dreary mood is what made us move. I can tell you that I wouldn't doubt for a second some shit is going down in this daycare. Hell, even a normal daycare in SLC is usually borderline creepy. Look into this more please. I can say with almost 100% certainty that this is definitely not what it seems from the outside. Fuck SLC. Fuck it as a whole.

       I live an hour north and spend a lot of time in SLC. I would say
       <strong>
        some
       </strong>
       of the city is creepy but not all. And I don't think it's fair to assume all Mormons are like that. Take into account that there are some very fucked up people in our world and in a large city it's not hard to come across more than one in a sitting.

       Look into the origins of the LDS if you haven't before, it's heavily steeped in esotericism and freemasonry - doesn't surprise me in the least to hear that about SLC though I've never visited myself.

       Hey, now. Mormon's aside, SLC (and the valley) is a lovely place. If you ever visit, I suggest going to Gilgal Garden - it's a weird sculpture garden that's filled with strange church related things. Not a lot of people know it's there!

        This is a pretty good intro I think.

       I don't know if
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       there is totally accurate and I'm sure it's missing some of the important details but most of it matches up with other things I've read.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I question/disagree with is the seeming implication in the timeline that L. Ron Hubbard was working
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       US intelligence interests whereas I've always thought that he was working for them.  Tough to know for sure I guess way but his working as an intelligence agent for the Navy during the 40's is well-documented and I think it's likely that he was working for them all along.

       See, this is the kind of stuff I like to see on this sub. This is genuinely interesting, rapidly developing, and creepy as hell. The day to day false flag/crisis actor/"COINCIDENCE?!?!"/etc. posts get rather tiring after awhile.

       There's some need for any sub to have new content posted every day, when there's not always something interesting happening every day.

       Would anyone really be surprised if this was some part of a child sex trafficking operation for the elite? I mean we have seen these psychopaths exposed for the scum that they are time and time again. The sad part is nobody in the higher echelons of power will be dealt any justified punishment for these disgusting acts against children. I really hope all of this is a huge misunderstanding and overreaction, but it doesn't seem that it is.

       That's exactly what I think it is. There have got to be better places to make meth at, you wouldn't open a fake daycare. Daycare centers, and especially ones that have lots of orphans, are how they make kids disappear :(((

       And the fact that they've been legaly licensed to be a daycare center....not just a sign they put up outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       What get's me is that this has, it seems likely, gotten the attention of the Reddit admins. The original post about this in r/conspiracy was removed. After speaking with the mods here, it seemed it was either the admins or a spam filter. After my last discussion with a mod who's been following this it seems to be more likely it was an admin removal. It's still up as far as I know, but pending finding out if it was an admin removal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the FUCK....would the admins care about a few posts about a maybe operating daycare in Salt Lake City? If it turns out they are removing it?

       You were antagonizing the other guy.  Your last three comments have no substance whatsoever other than to cause an argument.  The other guy was agreeing with you and attempting to explain the miscommunication and you weren't allowing him to or weren't understanding him for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, either way - if you have nothing to offer besides arguments and insults, perhaps consider not responding to someone at all.  Comments like these accomplish nothing other than derailing the discussion at hand.

       Witch hunts are a real thing. Remember the Boston Bomber "reddit detective work" that basically circled a bunch of foreign looking people on photographs and publicly labeled them "terrorist"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this daycare story fascinatingly creepy but you have to keep in mind that it's still possible that this is just a poor, run-down place that's maybe depressing but not otherwise special. In which case the damage done by a proper witch hunt could be greater than any kind of "reveal". As a mod/admin this is one of the #1 things to look out for because it's not just affecting the user's time on the site, it can actually swap in the real world.

       This is the theory. Orphans go through the state, and when one is identified as a candidate they transfer the orphan to the shell daycare and the kid dissapears. Poof.

       What about the shipments? Why would a pedophile ring order 8 tons of stuff (especially if it really is plastic jewelry and footballs, which I highly doubt)? And why was the same amount of stuff sent to other places? The shipments make me think this is somehow related to the military or a black site or something, not pedophiles.

       This, above all else, is what bothers me the most, and lends credibility to the human trafficking/pedo ring theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the scrapbook math (assuming I'm reading everything properly (QUANTITY- 763), taking into account 400-450g per ball) you should only be looking at about ~340ish KG.  This is over 6,800 KG of stuff shipped in.  Add to that, the BL lists 'MEASUREMENT 0 X'.  So we have sports balls that take up no space at all, that weigh 20x more than they should? Seriously, what the actual fuck did they receive in those shipping containers?
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as I said earlier in another post, if this really is a trafficking front, they've already shut it down and are moving on.

       Lol, I have a little bit of experience in this field. At market shows, or trade shows, it is very common for someone to set up a booth/table and claim to be a company that makes XYZ product. They will even have pictures or samples of high quality XYZ on display. You think they are legit and place an order with them. They then quote the order out to every mother fucker in China who makes XYZ product and send you whatever bullshit the lowest bidder makes. Depending on the product it might not make a difference. But more often than not what you get from these people is not the same quality as what you saw at their booth. I have actually gone to one of these company's "factories". It was an office in a sky rise office building. The most advanced piece of machinery in there was a fax machine. Even there, face to face, they continued their lie. The factory they said was theirs that they would take us to was my buddy's factory. Be very careful who you deal with at these trade shows. I've been to Guangdong (referenced in your screen shot) and that kind of bullshit is made there, for sure. Factories everywhere. Also, things I buy from Guangdong I actually buy through a "purchasing agent" I employ in Taiwan.
      </p>
      <p>
       [EDIT] posted this on another guy's comment but I think it is very suspect that this container left China and landed at a port in Virginia and not in California. Logistically this is very weird to me. Methinks the VA port is more lax than the CA port. Those CA ports are no joke!

       Eva Solano, when said with an accent, easily sounds like "Ava Salmon", especially if there is an additional language barrier by someone from China taking a voice order.. And they're bith speaking English as a second language.

       Honestly speaking, I think this would be detail that would be consistent for a legit day care. I say that because i'd almost expect that a day care provides cheap chinese toys for kids to play with that can be disposable, or broken at little to no cost for the day care.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is very fishy, but I think this is a minor detail that may not pertain to the big picture.

       Consider this. Most daycares are run by small groups and certified baby-sitters. I have a few day-care centers in my neighborhood, run out of regular people's houses. These people don't raise the kids, they take CARE of them. yeah, toys are provided, but not in the TONS. Like really? Having over 6800kg of toys shipped to that shack of a place doesn't seem too legit... These care givers rarely make that much money, and if they do, it goes back into the business.

       In fear of the admins, I officially cannot condone such an action. That said, if you decide to do it, a throwaway's a good idea, because you're pretty much guaranteed to get shadowbanned for doing it, and you might also want to have some kind of off-reddit backup place to post.

       I'm actually not too concerned with this place. I have a feeling it's all about timing and understanding. My hunch is that these places have been observed during odd times. Maybe the mail carrier was actually there during nap time and maybe the pizza man shouldn't be delivering pizzas when they weren't ordered by the day care. The Latino man outside the place could also be explained by other normal things. I guess we will find out. If someone beats me to a stake out, please inform me so I don't waste my own time.

       Just an update on the odd number at the end of the threat.... "5982471595 8267485319 F.R." could be a tracking number so the person who made the threat can see dissemination of the info on the internet. 
Simply google "5982471595 8267485319 F.R." and you will see that the ATS &amp; reddit threads pop up now. Scary Stuff.

       This is interesting, however true or not the story, one could imagine each agent of an intelligence service having a software bot searching these kind of numbers in google every so often (like every 5 mins), exploiting google's unmatched web crawling abilities, to indirectly transmit an e-location, i find that very interesting, brain tickle stuff... further down the meta reflection, perhaps the goal is to have curious minds enter these never seen before numbers in google.

       I wrote a paper on this in college. The mcmartin case was proven to be the work of a shitty child therapist and a schizophrenic mother.
      </p>
      <p>
       She dropped the kid off at the center without registering. Just dropped him on front of the door and drove off.  The people working there just took him in and waited for her to come back, which she did.
      </p>
      <p>
       She continued to bring him there.  She called the police stating that her child had been sexually assaulted. The police began an investigation. The state case, overseen by Janet Reno, involved a child psychologist who cajoled, scared, and manipulated the children at the center into describing scenarios, and asking which children were involved. The kids often started out saying that nothing unusual had happened.  She then continued to ask the kids questions as though they were lying.  The kids eventually broke down and started providing information that was demonstrably false.  She told them that their memories could be wrong, and then suggested to them what might have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thw original mother kept coming up with outlandish stories about tunnels under the center.  So the psychologist began by asking the children what happened in the tunnels.  The kids didn't remember any tunnels until she told them things like that they their friends had seen them in the tunnels doing sexual things with other children.  One child reported having been raped by a lion and seeing flying elephants.
      </p>
      <p>
       They actually dug out under the child care Center.  Found some buried random construction tools from the construction of the center and an an old piece of clothing. The owners of the childcare center were prosecuted using the information from the children's interviews. The women were later,after several years, released. A male caretaker, the son of the owner, spent many years in prison, and may still be there. He was when I wrote the paper. . It's considered, in psychology, as an example of how easy it is to implant false memories with improper questioning techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mother was schizophrenic, and a bad alcoholic. Her father told police this, but they did not listen. She died, if I remember correctly, of either suicide or something to do with alcohol. She was very ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is mostly from memory about 10 years old , so I may have some of the details mixed up. I think I still have the sourced paper around here somewhere. I believe most of the info is also in the Wikipedia article and it's linked sources.

       I learned about this case in a class on the history of the witchhunt. The guy finally got out of jail, but the whole thing ruined his life. Completely fucked up that Janet Reno was able to plant the "evidence" into the kids heads.  This day care thing on the other hand, something fishy is going on.

       It seems like he's suggesting it's an access route so that anyone going in or out doesn't have to be seen going in or out. This certainly fits with the theory that it's potentially a child sex dungeon or a drug thing. No one would want to be seen being involved in that.

       I understand. My satire stems from the fact that a laundromat would let a "concerned citizen" look at their security cam, as opposed to a "random internet person". By the way, all the concerned citizens in this thread are still random internet people.

       Yes, it's good that something bad is being brought to the light...so it can either A)stop happening , or B)someone gets in trouble for what is happening. It's progress, and it's moving in a good direction. More pedophiles need to be hunted down. I have a feeling...knowing about how it's documented that the royal family protected Jimmy Savile, and how Bush Sr. Was in the news for his "call boys"... That this is kept out of mainstream discussion because it involves a large majority of the ruling class. So I have no idea how you're manufacturing your own conclusions about my previous posts without even knowing my opinion on the issue, but in the end I guess I don't give a shit either way. I just don't like when people who can't interpret ideas put words back in my mouth.

       I'm just going by exactly what you typed above. No manufactured conclusions here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with this. This shit needs to be brought to light and the extent to which it's engrained in the elite's culture is becoming more evident.

       Going to keep following this story out of curiosity.

       Something is also off about the day care in Oakton VA. I grew up in Oakton and lived less than one mile from the center of town. The description of Oakton on the Miller Coop webpage does not seem correct. There is not really a downtown area of Oakton other than some stores at an intersection and a shopping center. There is no historic district in Oakton. The only musuem is a 1 room historic schoolhouse. Oakton is a very small town in Fairfax county and does not have the facilities that the webpage claims. Also, I cannot seem to find a physical address for the day care. It may be another fake day care business.

       Chunga International is a civil engineering firm according to a Facebook page. Looks like a Zimbabwain last name and the civil engineering photos appear to be in Africa.

       Seems like whatever Chunga International the Solanos are involved with is not an active business. Also weird name choice give the Zimbabwain origins.

       Here's an idea for anyone here that is interested, hope people see it. I'm not going to do this, because I don't live there and don't know all the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here are often saying this is a front for money laundering. If you have some proof of this, you can report it to the IRS and have them do an investigation. Here's a link to the program:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Whistleblower-Informant-Award">
        http://www.irs.gov/uac/Whistleblower-Informant-Award
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If they come and find out there is unpaid tax from this business, the person that reports it can get a cut of up to 30% of it. A few scattered redditors might only have limited resources, but there is absolutely no hiding from the IRS. They can monitor phone calls and mail without a warrant, if they have reasonable suspicion of tax fraud. They're the ones that brought down Al Capone. There may be some bad people in that building, but there's no way they're more powerful than the feds whose job is to collect money.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl;dr - For people who think this is a front for money laundering, and have proof of it, report it to the IRS. They have a whistleblowing program in place for stuff like this, and if they are successful, they'll pay you a reward of up to 30% of what they get. These guys can't outrun the IRS.
       </strong>

       OP:  Under "The Website" here is my comments before they got nuked:
      </p>
      <p>
       "This gets deep. URL is owned by a city employee. Why does the cities multimedia manager own the URL?
The county assessor's office says it's owned by Chunga International LLC. They have failed to renew their business license since 08/26/2014. The registering agent has the same last name as the SLC employee.
Fun Time Kidz Kare hasn't been registered since 05/24/2006. What's with the fresh paint?"

       I'm not sure if this is related, but a popular Utah radio host/local entrepreneur is called Jimmy Chunga. Could be a total coincidence though.

       Just off the one container from China a year ago, whatever was in it, assuming something illicit, is going to be worth a LOT of money, weighing in at ~8,000KG.  I can guarantee that whoever operates this thing has the money to deal with whoever wants to be stupid enough to stick their head up and try to spotlight this more.  But I may just do it anyway cause I have a good life insurance policy and my gf would LOVE being rich.

       It's actually not incredibly difficult to get your PI liscense, however gaining a reputation and clients is another thing. PI's get anywhere from 50-200$ per hour depending on city, experience, case, etc.

       Not to do anything to dismiss the overall creepiness of this whole debacle, but a lot of daycares here in Chicago (that I've seen in nice neighborhoods where I lived) would have decals or artwork completely covering all the windows. My best guess is that it's for the children's safety, as anyone (predators, parent with custody battle, etc.) could come and watch the kids through the windows otherwise.

       So I looked into the bill of lading # and they shipped to 4 places other than Salt Lake City the plastic jewelry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oregon, Iowa, Chicago, and California.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each place had the exact same weight of product shipped to them (1100kg)

       Putting the tl;dr first, cause it reads so awesome
      </p>
      <p>
       5 companies are on a bill of lading for 1 shipping container, contents listed as 1.1KG of "plastic jewelry", and 6,852KG of "soccer/footballs" from China.  1 company in California makes electronic and other "educational toys" and seems to be on the up-and-up.  1 bait-shop in Idaho with a registered sex-offender living at the same address as a company listed as receiver of goods from the shipment.
       <del>
        1
       </del>
       Some financial agency shell-game in Chicago. 1 shady day care in Salt Lake City whose owner shares the last name with an executive (see management, not mayoral) level employee working in City Hall.  1 bounce house rental company in Oregon no one has looked into yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual shipping of this container was facilitated by a company with an employed sales executive who once bought/sold 'merchandise' in the defense sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       /facts
      </p>
      <p>
       An executive who possibly networked transactions to and for, what I could only imagine being, a very intriguing international clientele in said defense industry.  However, there is nothing that explicitly connects this individual to the shipping of the container, other than he is employed for the company on the BL.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of that is made up.  The links are all right in this thread.  Except the stuff I've mentioned in my edits below, which I'll gladly share and encourage you to contact me to receive via PM. I just don't want this shut down for bs 'doxxing'
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, onto the post.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, not only was it the exact weights, it's the exact same product descriptions and shipping dates.
      </p>
      <p>
       And 'Funcrest Bait Shop' sounds shady as hell.  Although, all the names here involved are curious; Funland Jumpers, Fun With Phonics, Funcrest Bait Shop, and Fundamental Financial Group.  Someone really likes to have fun, and they all like getting the exact same stuff shipped to them on the same boat on the same day.  A literal boatload of fun!!
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: all of them, all 5 business, had all their stuff shipped in the same container.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2: Didn't realise I had made a new post, didn't mean to do that.  But I wanted to add:
      </p>
      <p>
       The address for Fun Time Bait shop, is the same address for a registered sex offender.  Not the owner of the business mind you, but we now have a legit tie-in to pedo and these chinese shipments.  So, that's, something?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fundamental Financial Group shipment: There is no website of record for this business, however a search for the name on the BL brings up a gentleman in the chicagoland area, currently working at two places; Fundamental and North South Capital, LLC.  The address on the BL is actually the address for North South even though the company listed is Fundamental, Fundamental is registered at a totally different location about 40-50 min away.  Smells like some shell-corp antics afoot all over this thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 3: So it seems one of the executives, based on his linked-in profile, at Fun Stuff Inc (facilitator of the chinese shipment) used to work for a short time with another company
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Nope, nothing curious about
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       .  Oh, and the company he works for now is the one who has their current merchandise pehind password protection.  Look at their site again, and ask why that is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 4: Can't seem to find much about the Fun With Phonics company, other than a lawsuit with Leapfrog.  What I do find curious though, is this is a company with almost 1 mil in annual revenue.  What are they doing in bed with these other 4 companies and shell corps?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, the owner has spent some time in Africa you say?  Educating the children of Ethiopia?  Good for him!

       Sam Shaw is the owner.  The business address seems to be an empty lot in the woods.

       Possible it might be off a little but images were taken recently far as i can tell (2015) and theres nothing there. It is registered as a 4 bedroom house built in 1991. I cant see one and theres nothing around that looks like a bouncy castle business. Its possible this is the mailing address and the business is somewhere else i suppose but even so theres no house there according to google. Their website does say they have ponies so perhaps they are there but i dont see anything.  And the names on the properties dont match.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the tax records i got this

       its registered to Keenan Benjamin INC. (this is getting strange)
33 acres of property. No business there. Its registereed as farmland.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked up the adreess listed on the tax site and it doesnt exist. There is a street in Salem with a similar address but is not exactly right.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS IS INTERESTING!

      </p>
      <p>
       Upon further search i found that Funland Inc founded by this " Sam Shaw" was at this address and it is listed as GUESS WHAT....
      </p>
      <p>
       A child daycare service.
      </p>
      <p>
       not a bouncy castle place. this is getting really fucked up now.
       <a href="http://or.mingluji.com/business_directory/Funland_Inc">
        http://or.mingluji.com/business_directory/Funland_Inc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The place is suppose to be closed and according to a couple searches is actually a single family home being rented to a man. ( wont post his name) hes been there for 4 years.  There is a woman listed at the same adress with a different last name. Possible girlfriend i guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know what else is interesting... this is close proximity to an elementary school.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if what i gather may be right this is a small house that was listed as a daycare years back and run out of a home, (if its not just a shell corp which is likely) or the person living there before used this address for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       However all the properties this "Sam Shaw" is associated with as owning DO NOT EXIST.  They are listed under other peoples names and addresses but listed as businesses with those address. He has several.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy is definatly hiding something weird. All of the businesses that name is associated with is tied to children.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a sex offender listed as the same name from another state that they apparently dont know where he is. (not saying its the same guy just coincidence)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/directory/us/oregon/aumsville/shaws-interiors-10173-keene-ln-se/">
        http://www.ibegin.com/directory/us/oregon/aumsville/shaws-interiors-10173-keene-ln-se/
       </a>
       now hes an interior rug store.. and party store.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR 
Same guy now apparently has a Carpet store.. that is also a party supply store.. that is also interior design.. that is also a kids party place.. that is also a bouncy castle place thats also a farm at the same address,
      </p>
      <p>
       that's not in his name (shell company that doesnt exist) whose address is actually a mobile home in a different town, whose associated to a child day care, whose also tied to a shipping company, thats tied to the other weird companies thats tied to sex offenders and possible trafficking.

       That's the real question.  Why is a derelict day care getting anything shipped in bulk from China?  Everyone here is saying it's some sort of human trafficking, but I'm inclined to say that China puts all sorts of labels on things to get around various tariffs and taxes and customs technicalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what could it be that all of these businesses have the same shipment?

       I'm starting to wonder what kind of money we would be looking at for these purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 theories:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Maybe there was nothing actually shipped and money was just embezzled and all these different companies are in on the scam.  All named on the same BL to obfuscate the reality that no one actually bought a damn thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why this particular child-care places sucks so much ass- they just don't care and utilize it to funnel state/city funds.  They got a guy in city hall to make any citations go away.  Then they utilize some off-shore chinese manufacturer to buy obscene amounts of 'stuff' so money is now off their corporate books and in their pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Considering they have some ex-military contractor possibly in charge of their chinese shipment, probably just a large drug trafficking ring.  I mean, almost 8,000KG is a LOT of drugs.  We've got 5 cities (companies) that we know of all named on the same BL.  If some of that is going to our guy in SLC, then he's running some major product.  To run that much product, you would need a business that a) didn't cost much to upkeep b) had very specific clientele do limit foot traffic.  With that much product, you also need a lot of people to help move it.  Those people tend to have kids, so BAM, day-care!  All the kids there are just the kids of the people who run the drugs.  Inspectors come in and see kids, so "ok, it's a day-care" meanwhile, they don't care about sanitation, training, immunizations or actually supervising them because they're friends of the family, so it's all good.  Not to mention our guy also works in city hall to grease those wheels (as per scenario A) and you have a pretty good front for drugs.  Add to that the possibility that laundromat across the street is involved in some capacity, since it's been busted before.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  I just did some basics maths on this one.  Assuming it's heroin alone,  that could be nearly street value of $5,120,000,000 (assuming $80/g, I have no idea how much a g would cost nowadays).  1 tril from each distribution node.  The fact that a pedo lives at an address where one of these shipments was received starts to make a LOT more sense.  Folks on the register have a very hard time landing a legit job.  This scenario is starting to look a lot more likely.

       Perhaps.  It very well could have been a perfectly fine establishment until it was bought for purposes of running a front.  Kinda like buying a reddit account- the longer it's around the more faith and trust people have in it and are less likely to question.

       Can we talk about how 8,000 kg is not just heavy, but that much mass is bound to take up a LOT of space. A huge truck would have had to stop there to drop that kind of package off. For instance, a solid block of iron that is 1m x 1m x 1m is roughly 8,000 kg. It's also the equivalent weight of
       <strong>
        6 Ford Fiesta's
       </strong>
       .

       I have.  There is no doubt child-trafficking rings exist.  Read up on boy's town, add in Finders, and you start to see the workings of a gov't sponsored trafficking ring.

       I just want to add that one can be listed as a "registered sex offender" for something as simple as public nudity. If this guy is just some random schmuck, let's not start calling him a pedo all over the internet unless we know those were the charges.

       I ordered a ripoff NFL jersey from China and they declared the package as shoes in customs. I think they might do that to avoid paying different customs fees. Like shoes may have a different customs fee than clothing for some reason.

       I buy stuff off ebay (from China) all the time and it's almost always labelled as something funny, I assume for that same reason.

       If they do that for a half pound jacket, I'd assume 8000kg would be even more important to fake / even more money to save

       I've imported from Nepal before and they did indeed slap a different label on the product than what it was for customs.  It was cheaper that way.  I bought cashmere throws, but they said they were a toy.  The guy even told me that do that so they don't need to pay as much.

       Now that could be just a silly person typing in an incorrect address but it is interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sex Offender could be living in the Campground located on the Bait shop property. Apparently they have a large area there that harbors people for long periods. It is interesting that a possible sex slave ring tied to overseas companies tied to this company has a sex offender tied to it..... Im working on more research and will post more below about whatever else i find.

       Visited the bait shop. It looks like it's closed for the season. No white rabbits, just the same crappy store with overpriced beer that's been here for years.

       I think it's VERY odd that a container coming from China landed in Vriginia and not in California... Logisticaly it doesn't add up... I've personally only ever dealt with ports in TX, NY and CA. CA ports (again, in my expereince) want to do ever examination possible on every single container that goes through. X-ray, tail gate, and sometimes, even more detailed than that. Doesn't matter how good your papers look or how long you've been bringing the same shit in from the same place they always want to get in there and finger fuck everything. Maybe the port in VA is a little more relaxed?

       I work with a company that sells throws, pillows, etc. to both retail and hospitality clients and their catalogue is password protected. In their case, I think it's to keep their designs from being knocked off.. not sure if that would be the case here.

       It's common for any company that sells wholesale, since wholesale buyers don't want customers to know how much they paid. Especially if it's cheap junk from China being marked up. This is a normal business practice.

       They are listed as vendors, at least to the ones I can track down old info on attendees, which was 4 of them.  So, they did at least pay money to be registered vendors.  Whether or not they were actually there/had exhibition space is anyones guess.

       At a stretch, it could be deducted that Fun Stuff Inc is linked to the 'Miller heights Co-op'. After looking extensively at forums and any non-official record of individuals writing about the place, I found nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       However later on, I realized that the Fun Stuff Inc order form is addressed to Hampton VA - a short drive from the location of this supposed daycare co-op.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS COULD BE A COINCIDENCE. However the lack of any intimate information regarding the miller heights spot weirds me the fuck out; espeically since its been around since 1966.....

       That's the problem, it's been shown time and time again that these international pedophile rings are protected by law enforcement, politicians, and the media, so what do you do?  I think the answer lies in the rest of us, especially those who have no idea about stories like this.

       It explains a lot, and is completely innocuous enough. I mean these places EXIST, we just don't really see them. That said, if it is, the worst I'd actually expect is a tiny blip on the federal taxes, covering the costs as they move out and establish a new one.

       One thing to remember is that this is the internet. So while this place is extremely shady, the weird threatening messages by new accounts are possibly people  not involved nor with any knowledge, but rather random people having fun trying to make the story seem more dangerous.

       It is easily explained by that being a horrible horrible template, you are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       However what it doesn't explain is how Miller Heights doesn't exist as a daycare.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a crowdsourced babysitting service for one neighborhood in one city in Virginia. Or that's how it started. The website explains that they now throw adult parties and activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would somebody pay money (since 2005 it seems) to host a website advertising something like that when your only audience for such advertisement is your neighbors? And why has their WHOIS info been protected by eNOM?

       That can also explain the duplicate "testimonials" and any other strange content - most of those templates come pre-packaged with placeholder content... Lots of businesses don't bother removing it for one reason or another (don't know how, didn't make a final payment to their web designer, forgot or got lazy, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are using a website template and they left some stale placeholder content up there, you can pretty much forget about anything on the site being reliable information. You can also make an assumption that they may have tried to cut corners in other areas of their business setup (licenses, records, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Source: I sell website templates for a living. Some templates can be in use by 10-1,000's of different businesses at any point in time. Finding two that never pulled the demo content is only surprising in that you didn't find a lot more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: clarity.

       Next time you do go by it, I suggest taking a bit of a closer look. Nothing that would get you into any trouble, legal or otherwise, but enough to tell if there's anything odd going on, and keep us posted.

       Well if it was confirmed that an admin removed the post then, agree with it or not, there isn't really anything we can do.  They have the final say when it comes to this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as what else, I honestly don't know.  But it seems like one of the link-shortened google maps URLs could've been what triggered the spam filter.

       I've probably read every post on here and ATS and even some of the craziness over at 8chan... and as much as I think this is a great thread, very suspenseful, and might actually be on to something bigger than a oddly maintained daycare center... I think you're all reading WAAAAAY too far into the rabbit sticker on the fence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As somebody else asked...are NONE of you familiar with sticker street art? That rabbit is clearly a drawing that an artist did (complete with some kind of tag/signature underneath), made stickers of, and posted around town. Not being from SLC or anywhere near, I can't say how prolific said sticker artist may be...but I honestly think the craziest thing we can focus on here is the significance of "the white rabbit," "the rabbit hole," etc. Being a conspiracy sub, obviously these phrases are going to immediately pop into our heads...but do you really think that if there is some seriously dubious operation going on, they'd try to call attention to it by inviting armchair sleuths and conspiracy theorists to "follow the white rabbit down the rabbit hole" of creepy day care conspiracies?

       Yes, that is odd, if it is in fact true. I'll believe that claim once I see a picture.  A lot of things seem odd in this case - particularly the immediate scrubbing of info from the internet...but they could also just have gotten word of all of the claims being made online and decided to remove the sticker, as it became a hot topic of discussion here and on ATS.

       While part of me would like to believe we've stumbled upon some front for The Finders, if that were the case, they've already closed up, moved on, and left behind a good cover.  This could easily explain the removal of net presence and scrubbing WHOIS info and leaving behind misdirections such as the sticker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chances are however, it's just some people trying to scam money from the local gov/state/fed and they're trying to cover their tracks and get rid of as much stuff as possible that's been posted on the internet, both info and stuff around the 'day care'.  I have reached out to some in this thread who say they are local, to at least confirm the removal of the sticker, if for no other reason than to just add to the whole 'wtf' factor.

       True. Chances are - if something is actually arye here - it is something much less sinister than a child sex slave trafficking ring...something like tax evasion or scamming the government out of benefit $$$.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anybody's going to uncover any bombshells at this point. If it was actually some insane conspiracy with underground tunnels and sex dungeons (which I'd say is pretty much a 1/1,000,000 chance considering all of the other more mundane crimes that could elicit the same defensive/mysterious response from an owner), there has surely been enough time to clean house and get rid of all evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best guesses are that either 1) this is simply a failed/failing business with godawful architecture and was all exaggerated by anonymous parties on Reddit and egged on by trolls to begin with or 2) the owners are involved in shady monetary schemes and now are feeling the heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       People talking about going on stakeouts or touring the daycare while armed with a concealed carry are absolutely out of their  gourd and need to find a fucking hobby.

       Well...I would like to see another one of said stickers, then, somewhere else. Just 1 more would satisfy me. And I couldn't find the logo online anywhere. If you're going through the trouble of making stickers, your logo is probably on the internet
       <em>
        somewhere
       </em>
       , right?

       No...not right. Unless somebody puts you up on Instagram or something. Sticker art is still technically graffiti...and graffiti is illegal. So graffiti writers/street artists tend to keep themselves anonymous.

       So if this was your graffiti art, and you got it made into stickers, wouldn't you put it in more than one place? Has anyone ever seen this before?

       How do we know that anyone HASN'T ever seen this before? I mean...sure...there have been plenty of people here and on infinitychan claiming to be in the SLC area who aren't familiar with this rabbit sticker...but lets be real. I am a graffiti fanatic, and I still see stickers and tags that are new to me all of the time...and I'm always looking out for stuff...Bottom line is you, I, or anybody else in this thread may have seen this sticker before somewhere and not even processed it or paid it any attention because our brains didn't have a reason to give a shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS I gave you an upboat because I appreciate the Devil's Advocate POV...but it goes both ways. It is MORE likely that this sticker exists in other places, yet none of us have noticed it or realized.

       There are other reasons I don't think this is graffiti art. For example the detail of the mean looking eye vs. the rest of the drawing, and the human initials underneath (or possibly looks like a carrot &amp; a string). Just my speculation.

       My buddy lives near this place. I drive by it when I see him. I've never seen any kids in their before and we have this joke about how ghetto it is. Seriously, Fun Time Kidz Kare? What kind of bullshit name is that for a daycare in a house that looks like a dollhouse? The windows are tiny, we joke about it being that way so no one can escape.

       Our automod is open source and we can modify that but I don't think we have any access to the sitewide spam filter - if we do I haven't seen it and I'm not sure how we'd access it.  I think what happened yesterday though is that a google maps URL was using a link shortener and that's what triggered it.

       Not that I agreed that should have been done, but the admin's reasoning, at least on the surface, seems a bit more reasonable. i.e. nationally covered tragedy where supposedly a large number of young children were just murdered...vs....

       A single, small, maybe not functioning daycare center that's so far generated 3, honestly, small posts.  If the
       <del>
        mods
       </del>
       admins delete this or the other post it would definitely seem like a response out of proportion with the level of interest it's generated.  Unless I'm missing something here.

       Yeah I thought of the Sandy Hook clusterfuck as well.  I wish I had more information with regards to this current story but there definitely seems to be more to it.  There's no doubt that the building and some of the details surrounding it are incredibly sketchy though.

       removed the thread that

       The thread was removed from

       because harassing or conspiring to harass individuals or businesses, no matter how "sketchy" some random redditor thinks it is, violated rule number 5 of our subreddit and general principals of decency. There's some content posted that also violated rule number 6, which goes along with Reddit's policy about no posting personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there are talks of people taking pictures, breaking in, and doing other obnoxious things to some place that is probably just a victim of unfortunate circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care about that business or whatever you people think is weird about it.  I just don't want this to turn into another incident where Reddit's over eager pitchfork mobs cause some negative publicity event and cause undue stress to people that have no idea what this site even is.
      </p>
      <p>
       A common sense perspective on this would suggest that this is just a really poorly run business that you people are harassing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Since apparently it matters, not some throwaway account.  Been an active member of Reddit for 6 years, seen some really stupid stuff happen that I'd like to not see happen again.

       Yeah, objectively I'm absolutely shocked at the lengths some people will go to alleviate their own boredom. This is half users needing to get a life and half users needing to stop fucking with others lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorite theory so far is the drug cartel money laundering front... Because like 5 NIMBY soccer moms and armchair sleuths have never seen someone go in or out. "Concerned citizens" my ass, you all need to mind your own damn business. That's analogous with me posting a picture of one of these NIMBY's oddly colored house and stirring the pot into making everyone believe that person is a child pornographer and starting a witch hunt because, secretly, I'm the president of their neighborhood HOA and don't like the color of theist house. Not only is this a very large conclusion to jump to, anyone approaching the location of a cartel building and peering into windows is just a dead man walking... As if they didn't have surveillance to watch for shit like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the armchair in front of a tv that people are implying is used to watch pedophilia on CCTV... More like a god damn way to monitor bratty fucking kids, watch soap operas, and be left the fuck alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, for all the participants in this thread, if you're that concerned call the police. It's not your job to investigate a damn thing, half of what you'll find won't even be right, most of you are too caught up in the mass hysteria going on here to be able to step back and see that MAAAAYYYYBE this is just a little bit too much, and you all need a break from the constant reminder of government surveillance. Go watch some cat videos.

       my buddy and I started following this whole ordeal yesterday. After work, at around 4:30 Mountain Time, he swung by the place and saw the two little girls leaving with an older Hispanic male. He says he saw the three of them get in to a car. He has make/model/color/plates, but i don't wanna get banned. haha.

I imagine they are freaking out a bit with all the attention this is getting, it sounds like a damn bit operation involving several cities. Or it could be nothing at all, who knows. There is some pretty compelling evidence though.

       The story was that someone took their kid there and they had a single kid in there. If the person wanted to begin bringing their child there, they had to sign a contract agreeing to never tell anyone who the child is. It had nothing to do with anyone calling anyone.

       Okay? It's entirely the same situation. Perhaps the child was the subject of a custody dispute. Perhaps the child was involved in a lawsuit related to being in a wheelchair. Perhaps the child had been abused, and was in foster care. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       The takeaway is that the child's identity and privacy are respected. All of those situations are far more plausible than the ones that have popped up. I agree that this center is odd, and that there are very weird things about it--but keeping the identities of minor children private isn't one of them.

       The business keeping the identity of the child private isn't strange, no.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Child A goes to the daycare, the child will have to get to know the handicapped boy (as kids at daycare do), especially since it's just them two, and eventually they will probably tell the parents about the boy. Contractually barring that parent from telling anyone (friends, family, other parents who ask about the daycare...) about the one boy that their child goes to daycare with is strange. Parents will talk to other parents about who their kids go to daycare with. It's a normal conversation. If placing a gag order on someone doing that seems reasonable to you, then I don't know what else to say.

       And I don't know what to say that you think it's strange--you have no idea what the circumstances are surrounding this child's presence in that daycare. It would be

       It's pretty common here in the D.C. area; you're asked to not discuss your children's classmates when asked by people you don't know. It's pretty simple--don't talk about other people's kids with strangers. I'm still not sure why you think that's weird.

       Adding the caveat "with strangers" makes it a reasonable request. I, however, don't think you realize the legal difference between "strangers" and "anyone"
      </p>
      <p>

       Ive done extensive research into this today, at the shipping company end of it that ships them stuff, and the connecting 5 companies that were shipped in the same day in the same containers. They are all weird ass stuff and each one has some kind of lawyer or government person involved and a sex offender on some level all have multiple shell companies hiding them and fake locations as well as well as things involving children. Check my recent comments for more. with links with proof and such.

       <em>
        Sigh
       </em>
       , I'm not posting this on my main account because (no offense) some of y'all seem a little wacky.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to work at this building in 1994/1995 when I was 18.  It was definitely just a daycare then, I can not vouch for what it may or may not be now.  HOWEVER, all of y'all going on and on about the NAME "Fun Time" being a whole huge conspiracy thing are completely off base.  It was called "Fun Time Day Care" back then, and the name was clearly just kept and slightly changed.  I even remember getting prank calls from guys "Hey baby, I'm looking for a Fun Time".
      </p>
      <p>
       It was owned by a guy named Rick, don't remember his last name.  He was a maybe 40ish Mormon white guy.  Nice enough guy.  The place mostly had low-income families, and a lot of them were on state assistance.  I'd say 90% of the kids/families were white.  The building was NOT bright green back then, it was a non-descript cream color and people were always tagging the side of the building, so I'd venture to guess that's why it was eventually painted green.
      </p>
      <p>
       The room with all the covered up windows was the older kids' room.  The room at the back of the building was the babies &amp; y 1-2 year olds room, and the third room (not counting kitchen/bath, this is on the far side of the building from this picture) was the 2/3 year olds.  There is also like a little "lobby" at the front door where the time clock and other such stuff was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, my point is, stop being so creeped out by the fact that it LOOKS like a daycare but it may not actually be one.  It LOOKS like a daycare because it WAS a daycare, for a very long time.  No, we didn't used to cover up the windows the way it's covered now, but we did put artwork up in the windows - partially just to block out the sun but also so that we could try and pretend we weren't at a busy street corner, ya know?
      </p>
      <p>
       I loved working at this place, I just hated getting paid $4.25 an hour.  Loved the kids, and the other "teachers" were nice enough, although I can honestly say I was the only one that truly loved being there...  which, you know, ALL day care workers should love working with children, but you need to pay them more than minimum wage to get them to stick around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have pictures of the kids from back then, so I have plenty of interior shots of the place.  However, since they ALL have pictures of little kids in them, I'm sure you can imagine why I wouldn't want to post any of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's made me really sad to see all these posts about a place I have such fond memories of.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS  I don't live in Salt Lake anymore, so I can not go spy on the place for you, sorry.

       I actually believe your story.  I think that in the time since you stopped working there till no things have changed.  Well, quite obviously they have changed.  That is the part of the story we're trying to figure out here.

       Right, because MY story is the one that sounds outlandish.  I have no idea what the place is now, I was simply offering up personal experience that it did in fact used to be a perfectly normal daycare.  I'm pretty sure THAT is a matter of public record, so I didn't say anything that can't be easily proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only felt compelled to post because honestly, it really did make me sad to see all these weird conspiracies about the place.  When I saw the headline in the "scary things that happened on reddit" thread I clicked on it because it was Salt Lake, and was rather shocked to find it was a picture of a building I know so well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, I'm sure you'll continue to believe whatever you want to believe.

       What if behind that post it note is the meth lab?   And who takes a picture while their food sits on the table getting cold?  Especially spaghetti which is terrible cold.  Unless what is behind that post it note is an animal sacrifice and that is what is in your bowl.  Take a look at those pictures sheeple??  We have two options.  One is that it really is a daycare and everyone is overreacting.  Two is that it is a Illuminati hideout where they make meth while sacrificing animals which they turn in to spaghetti and eat as they plot to overthrow us all.  Take a look at that balloon animal, it is pointed right signifying death.  And if you notice in the other picture the word "chain" is written.  No my friends, the truth is right in front of us.

       I was always out on our porch. I mean always. Out of what I can remember is the vehicles. Lots of exempt license plates. Meaning possibly government vehicles.  Doesnt make sense. Seen many different people come go. Lots of work vans without plates more then anything.  Really scary now that someone has posted about this place im so glad I moved holy shit

       EDIT: This is crazy. Any other questions hit me with them. We come from Germany so we didnt really make friends with the neighbors. But I swear they had a plumber or a electricians van twice a day it seemed like

       Actually, I'm glad this was brought up. There's been a few comments saying "you need to get your child in through WFS," and other comments saying, "that's a lie." An under-the-table daycare for immigrants seems likely to me. But...in

       Utah's a straight shot up I-15 from the SoCal border, with easy access from other border states. They also have wonderful social services when compared with NM and AZ. I can see it being a decent place to spend the winter vs. the usual migrant spots in Florida.

       Also of note is the similarly terrible website for that toy company, which is a bit more detailed, but its catalog is password-protected. Typically businesses don't hide their products. You can't even order stuff online. You can print a pdf of an order form, fill it out, and fax it or scan it and send it via email. It doesn't list the specific brands of toys they sell, or any sort of legitimate confirmation it's an actual toy company. There's a vague "pirates" category, which is just a picture of a very broad assortment of pirate-related toys, but is not professional at all. Possibly a stock photo?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just weird, especially for a company that claims itself to be such a major player in its industry. All the pictures of its products look like weird stock photos, as do the pictures on the childcare website. It would be interesting to actually try and order something from the toy website to see if it's real. Of course, this requires access to the catalog of things they SELL. Maybe somebody can contact the company through the one page that isn't protected, and get the information? Even if it proves to be an actual toy company, it's one of the most solid leads we have.

       Wholesale businesses frequently password protect their catalogs, so that potential customers cannot browse and comparison shop cheap foreign goods from a number of suppliers. It's really not uncommon at all. Neither are awful websites! I mean, we're talking about the wholesalers who supply dollar stores--so it's the bottom of the barrel in terms of merchandise quality.
       <br/>
       Not to detract from the overarching weirdness of the childcare place w/o no kids in it, but nothing you've brought up is strange at all for wholesalers who deal with cheap foreign junk.

       The Feds rented property from someone I know personally in the mid 90's under the name Emerald Empire. Emerald Empire was part of a customs operation called "Casablanca" which was tracking money laundering through the Cali Cartel.   Amada Carrillo Fuentes was killed in suspicious circumstances a year before the raid to protect informants and or faked his death to retire safely depending on who you believe. I was working in the same industrial complex As Emerald Empire for years and didn't know a thing was going on until after the bust. They seized more than a hundred million dollars in the bust. Banks were in on it.

      <blockquote>

        Bancomer, Banca Serfin and Confia banks were indicted along with more than a dozen low- and mid-level bankers accused of knowingly laundering what they thought were proceeds from the Cali and Juarez drug cartels.

       GPS coordinates point to remote Russian forest. Didn't someone say the guy on the phone had a Russian accent? Also, Chunga does mail order stuff. So this is obviously a Russian child bride mail order service. And when you go to those coordinates in Russia, you will find the federation is secretly building a war ship to go to war with the Romulans. Wait...

       his address matches up with

        http://imgur.com/GEc5sVi
       </a>
       That PACER case I was looking at, Jose Solano was assigned to sell a house that was claimed by federal bankruptcy court, was assigned to the case Jan 2014, so he is or very recently was a realtor.

       What about the possibility that this is a triage area for children victims of any kind of domestic child abuse, and you all are now creating an online record for criminals to track down the children who the State has deemed it safest to keep separate? That would explain a few of the details herein, including the inept but sincere attempt to get you all to shut up about it. This is not far from the City Police station, down the road a few blocks. I think something like that is far more likely than some True Detective rape center, or whatever is going on in your self-styled PI theories.

       Shady stuff can always be an attempt to help people in hiding, but I feel like a government agency wouldn't look so shady on the outside of the building they are using and be ordering shady shipments from China of plastic jewelry and toys, but that's just me.

       Very interesting, if someone was busted in 06 for Meth distribution at the care center it would make a lot of sense why the building is so difficult to get any info on. I wouldnt want a child care services center with a history of meth salesmen to watch my kids, but why keep the name after all these years, repaint but not change the name...?

       I'm absolutely floored by the stupidity of the people who down voted you for making a reasonable suggestion and contributing to the discussion. That's entirely plausible, and what's more with the dingus parade peering into windows and ordering pizzas to the joint(which if they paid for over the phone with a card, which is also highly possible as I believe that I had read it was left, their name is on the receipt they would have left with the box).. IF oN the chance that the resident "le detectives" did actually find a group of criminals conspiring, they're TOTALLY going to know!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Let alone the fact that if all of these photos people are taking and posting were taken from cell phone cameras, they're being geotagged exactly where those photos were taken. The metadata can be extracted and the owner of the phone could conceivably be located... But let's not pay any attention to the fact that, collectively, this sub is wholly against government surveillance and is for privacy rights, yet lacks the mechanism of cognitive dissonance to see where protecting and already anonymous usernames friend that ADMITTEDLY COMMITTED A CRIME and accusing a business owner of being a child pornograoher or a manufacturer of drugs while posting their name, business address, phone numbers etc don't match up in ideology! I don't give a fuck if they DO say it's "public knowledge". Pulling the data from those photos could also be considered public knowledge.
      </p>

       It won't be long until Anon decides to call in a bomb threat, just because he can't stand the suspense. Then comes the seat team...

       The "reason" is the various abnormalities of the building, schedule, shipments, and lack of children or activity. The  "paper trail" reinforces the notion that there is improper documentation and insufficient available information regarding the establishment as a childcare center, not to mention all the odd shipments as noted in the OP. At the very least, it would be important to verify that the building is up to code, and that all regulations are met or exceeded as a registered child care center.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no harm in an audit, given that we're talking about
       <em>
        children.

       Nothing wrong with the building. Might be a little outdated and haggard but I have seen trailers used as day cares before. You are not going to get the schedule of the facility unless you have a child there, that is common sense since it prevents pedos from stalking the place.

        The "paper trail" reinforces the notion that there is improper documentation and insufficient available information regarding the establishment as a childcare center, not to mention all the odd shipments as noted in the OP.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What kind of paper trail would you like? The day care is obviously a day care cited by the numerous fines they have had over the years (which are quite high but not completely out of the norm). Again, the shipment has nothing to do with the day care at all.

        At the very least, it would be important to verify that the building is up to code, and that all regulations are met or exceeded as a registered child care center.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Meh, no one is really going to give a shit for the most part. This is a day care located in not so great area of SLC. While it may not be 100% or a place you bring your kid they are certified to receive kids through the government services. That would be impossible to do if they were not suitable.

        There's no harm in an audit, given that we're talking about children.

      <p>
       I agree there is no harm to audit but when you are calling, sending pizzas, taking creepy pictures through the windows, and stalking the place it becomes a concern of safety for the children. You are more likely to be arrested for stalking or whatever than this place to be shut down for being unsuited for children.

       That is one of their very many violations.

      <p>
       It shows this address: 1248 South 300 East, UT 84111
      </p>
      <p>
       When I look at the picture on google it is curious how every window is completely covered up.....like a dungeon.  I mean why have so many windows only to cover them all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also with so many violations you would think this place must be legit, but those could be faked.

      <p>
       The website has a content copy write for 2015, but the trade show schedule is only updated for 2013. Don't have time right now to see if the trade shows were legit or if Fun Stuff inc. was there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, many of the links in the require authorization, including the Online Catalog and Online Catalog Cont.
       <strong>
        What type of online retailer (1) can't fit all their items into 1 catalog page on a website and (2) wouldn't want potential effing customers looking at their inventory without authorization?
       </strong>
       Obviously a front, no business is intentionally that bad at marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the
       <a href="http://www.funstuffinc.net/uploads/order_form.pdf">
        order form
       </a>
       is about as empty as possible and requires the purchaser to enter items, prices, cc info, and everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is total guesswork here, but on the site the title says "FUN STUFF" subtitled "The name says it all." If this is truly a trafficking ring, it would be a semi-clever name to hide the meaning "F you and stuff" hinting at sexual services being offered. But that is a stretch.

       It's actually really common for wholesalers to have their catalogs password protected, so that you cannot comparison shop for cheap foreign junk. That's not weird at all. Most purchases would be made over the phone anyway, and handled via purchase orders &amp; checks, not automated, computerized shopping carts like Amazon. Most of these places are still Mom &amp; Pop shops and are absolutely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       your usual consumer-oriented retail-level environments--they're bottom of the barrel wholesalers.
       <br/>
       And yes, they are intentionally that "bad" at marketing, because they aren't aimed at you--or me--or anyone else sitting at a computer. They're aimed at people who own dollar stores, run county fair booths, small party stores, etc., they are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       retail level suppliers at all. I mean, you can call one of these places up, set up an account in 4 minutes and browse their catalog all you want--but you actually have to talk to a human being. ;)

       I have been a parakeet for the propaganda manure spreader.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have spread lies, unknowingly, thinking I was helping expose the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have believed information I did not confirm for myself
      </p>
      <p>
       This is really bad practice. This can drive a person downwards. This is destructive. This is herd mentality...
      </p>
      <p>
       and it is exactly what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey... by all means. Keep proving that you are easily tricked. It's true. 9/11 was fucked. The elite do rape kids. There is, has been, or will be atleast ONE daycare in Salt Lake City Utah, that is a front of some sort. Whether it be abusing kids, laundering money, or counterfeiting muffin mix. Whether it be a front for the CIA, the KGB, Mexican Cartels, Networks of trans-human Satanists and their carefully crafted spawn...
      </p>
      <p>
       Man... if you thought it... it's happened. And if you thought it, you are capable of these crimes yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's catch these fuckers. Let's make them pay too. I agree. Let's be smart about it. Let's all contribute something, and rest in thoughtful contemplation before submitting to excitable tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chase the rabbit indeed... but please be careful... for the rabbit is bait. And you are not the hunter. You are the hunted.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALSO: It's human trafficking awareness month... if this SLC Saga is simply a thought project... or ARG... it's a damn good one. And it's raising awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Cause now I wanna find out all the criminal fronts happening in my own town!
      </p>
      <p>
       I know nothing of magick or sigil power, or thought control. But it seems that this has been quite a good project, should it all be a "troll".

       Ooooh yeah, this place.  I lived near there for years and always considered it to be creepy level 1000.  After years of being around it, the pics I've seen in this thread are the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       time I've ever seen kids in/around it.  I honestly thought it was out of business but being maintained by the property owner.
      </p>
      <p>
       That all said, I am not so sure anything sinister is going on other than the possibility of it being used as a front for something not child related.  It's in a pretty heavily trafficked area and I think it'd be difficult for them to set up a child trafficking outpost there.  You never know though.  The feeling I got from that place reminded me of the "day care" in Silent Hill 4...

       Definitely could be a message that the sender was trying to send to help us without overtly saying anything. Maybe the numbers stand for letters and the "F.R." stands for some kind of code we could look up to know which numbers are for which letters. We need a codebreaker in here!

       Think about it. People think it's weird because:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's government owned
      </p>
      <p>
       It's 'shady' looking
      </p>
      <p>
       4 possibly unobservant people never saw anyone go in or out
      </p>
      <p>
       3 or 4 possible trolls are saying things like "watch out what you look into"
      </p>
      <p>
       They answer the phone weird? This has nothing to do with maybe getting like 1000 calls the passed week from people sending them pizzas?

       Whoever runs the website IMMEDIATELY taking down the site and scrubbing their info from WhoIs IP lookup once the initial post went up. That's pretty weird to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as I said..everything seems off. Yea, these could all be a series of coincidences or some small time crime like tax evasion or something. This time yesterday I wasn't convinced it was anything more than a shitty day care. But the links to the Chinese shipping shit..the dude who works for that toy import company having his previous job be for a defense contractor....ummm what? That is a strange transition in the job market if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly though, if you're that interested, do your own research and analysis. There's plenty of info here...no need for other Redditors to spoon feed it to you.

       This is weird to me as well. Definitely odd and worth taking a look at. Just playing devil's advocate though, maybe they scrubbed the info to keep themselves from getting doxxed by internet trolls? Could be a possibility. A lot of odd circumstances surrounding this place, but I'm still going to reserve judgement.

       Too many examples in this thread.  What, you think that if a group was collaborating in an act as disgusting and nefarious as human trafficking they wouldn't make an effort towards covering it up?  Actually, if I had to pick one example I'd pick the shilling towards the daycare.  If they were legit, they wouldn't need to do that and certainly wouldn't go towards the effort.

       Well I'll admit I'm a bit ignorant on how this whole human trafficking thing works, but I imagine having a daycare allows them to move many kids at once without anyone batting an eye.  Of course I'm on the internet and love excitement such as this though, could just be a plain really shitty daycare that makes their kids take naps all day.

       How often would it likely happen that
       <em>
        every

       time the postman comes, it's nap time? Unless, for example nap time is always 1-3pm, and the postman always comes exactly between 1 and 3?

       If the place were full of kids (or even half full), there would be activity. It's admittedly a bit off, don't you think?

       Well.. Ariel Castro's place looked pretty normal too.  So maybe not a human trafficking but something shady nontheless.  Specially when the pictures of inside the place have been the same for

       What I find odd is the person who managed to get pictures of the inside of the building:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's a weekday
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's still winter, so it gets dark early-ish and it's still light out in the pics that were posted
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that it's during the day on a weekday, there should be kids inside
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are no kids inside
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All the chairs are stacked inside
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cardboard covering most of the windows does not seem like the kind of environment I'd want my child in
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some people claiming kids are only for WFS families, some claiming that that is a lie - just the fact that there's some question about that seems suspicious
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some person in
         <a href="/r/panichistory">
          /r/panichistory
         </a>
         said it was a business purchased by a son to keep his 72 year old mother busy and not-lonely, which sounds all well and good - but odd that if it's supposed to be keeping her busy with kids running around, why are there no kids running around?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You're right about the "4 possibly unobservant people never saw anyone go in or out," but only at face value. It might be entirely possible for people to not see people going in or out, but the fact that there is actually no one inside the building during work hours on a weekday means that, indeed, there are no people going in or out (save the cleaning lady (?))
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I'm willing to concede that it may indeed be a daycare that's operated by a 72 year old woman to keep her busy and that she's just doing a really shitty job at it. But if she's doing a shitty job at it, at the very least, she shouldn't be in charge. These are kids for christ's sake, someone competent should be in charge, right?

       3-4 locks eh? You could get a fire marshall to inspect the place for safety and emergency exits. I just googled the place and looked at streetview. It's right next to a residential house and across from a commercial building. The building itself is just bizarre.

       so before you ask questions that were already asked, it may be above or a separate thread may be linked to in the post above as well. I am following semi-closely and can already see a lot of questions getting ignored that are answered in edits/other posts that are already linked to. Just to save you some frustration!

       Based on a Google search for Jose Solano, I have found he is a webmaster for 'Salt Lake City Corporation', which I'm pretty sure we already knew. The address that is given for his residence is the same as the daycare. The reason that was interesting to me was that the daycare was not mentioned anywhere else in the particular information sheet for Solano.
      </p>

       EDIT 2: Another website
       <a href="http://www.corporationwiki.com/Utah/Salt-Lake-City/jose-solano/124393341.aspx">
        http://www.corporationwiki.com/Utah/Salt-Lake-City/jose-solano/124393341.aspx
       </a>
       shows corporate affiliations for SLC Corp. Also shows a Jose E Solano in Provo, Utah for Chunga International, LLC.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the affiliations he had was Jun Fan. Jun Fan seems to be connected to multiple Asian companies as well. I seem to remember there being shipments from Asia somewhere in the comments/threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what all of this means, but this all look like shell companies to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 3: Seems that a Jose Solano got a divorce back in 2001 in the Provo district. (possibly useless info.)

       The citations list in this link shows numerous incidents of the day care director failing to provide current licensing credentials (in 4/2008 the center is cited after routine inspection for this and a half dozen other offenses, usually revolving around lack of sufficient supervision for the 8-12 kids in the center...citation states that current cert must be provided by 6/08. There is no followup until 2009, where director once again has expired or invalid license...)
At least every time the inspectors come there are actually children present in the day care..

Rule 100-19(4)(b):06: Discipline measures shall not include any of the following: restraining a child`s movement by binding, tying, or any other form of restraint that exceeds that specified in Subsection (3) above.
Findings: Upon licensing arrival, Margene was observed yelling at a boy on the swingset. A representative from DDI, Charlene, entered the facility 20 minutes later. Charlene informed licensing that Margene was outside yelling at the children. Once Margene brought the children inside the center, she continued yelling at the children to sit on the rug. This item must be corrected by September 5, 2007.

       Reading the threads from the last little while, I very much doubt there'd be hidden codes or messages, if you have something interesting, please share it. But this doesn't seem like the type of case where that would come into play.

       There's two theories:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just the naming they used for their fronts to import whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chinese company is shipping in alphabetical order, so all the names with FUN in them would be shipped in the same crate.

       This whole situation is full of weird coincidences, and I doubt we will get any further answers from now on. It sounds like the police have started investigating, and something may come out in a while.

      <p>
       Edit: Seems like the police were being redirected from Jose Solano, not the daycare.

       I believe it was on this thread before it got removed, I may be wrong though. It said if you called the number for the daycare, it went straight to police.

       I think that was when people were calling Jose Solano, and he was claiming harassment and redirecting to police, not so much related to an investigation.

       I cannot find a physical address. If you google day care in Oakton VA, Miller Heights Coop is not a result. My phone is not loading the map correctly but the map on their website seems to point to a location inside a park (difficult run stream valley park). Perhaps one of you with a better phone can check the map on their about us page. There are no pics of the business on the website. As explained elsewhere in this thread, it is obviously a copied website, but there is no physical location for this business.

       You're right it could just be some community group.  I don't know where the community would meet since that area is just suburban houses.  It creeps me out that the website is similar to the shady business in this thread and it does not have a physical address.  Seems weird but its possible its just some small community group with a copied webpage.

       Noticed something else fishy. On the member website they have a job posting for an administrative assistant for $150,000 fron 2009. The contact person is Steven Job. Why would a young family coop pay an administrative assistant $150k? Seems like a scam of some sort.

       Has anyone contacted SLC police and voiced their concerns? Death threats, terrible facilities, sex trafficking.. This is heavy stuff, yo. Even if the cops can't do anything it would be interesting to see their reaction to the place. It could help shed some light on the situation. If cops won't broach the subject, then something bad is going on...

       They do have an automatically made, blank Facebook page. One person "likes" it. I checked to see if they are a person from SLC but could not tell. Maybe someone can message them and see if they know anything about it? Maybe they just "liked" it because all of this blew up, or maybe they are actually familiar with the place?

       This saga was damned intriguing until somebody pointed out that the shipping website was crap, rendering the conspiratorial element of this mull and void. The other four businesses became irrelevant, the shipping container becomes irrelevant and we're back to caviling about a shady daycare which is likely a run of the mill money haven/ tax dodge, like most registered small businesses are. The fact that people are now rambling on this thread about cults, rabbit symbols, hidden messages and the sinister import of the topography of Hudson bay indicates that the real show is over and now the midgets are doing tricks for change.

       People are not "rambling on", they're genuinely curious and are throwing around different ideas and tangents to try and get some leads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are the 4 other businesses irrelevant? I must have missed that part, explain if you would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the 4, with the exact same BL number each time:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are more elements of conspiracy, which you claim to be "mull and void", so please explain:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         multiple failed inspections, with minimal penalties, then none after 2011
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         name aliases for the parties with government involvement
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         all of the initial threats to stop looking into this
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         no way to actually register a child here
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the address for one of the above is the EXACT same as a convicted pedophile
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         another involved party is an ex-military contractor
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So, until you present sound explanations for all of those, there remains plenty of conspiracy potential.

       You've been following this so you should have seen the posts debunking that site. Searching an order brings up multiple unrelated businesses. Other posters tested their own orders against the site and got bs results. I would link to the posts if I were on my computer, but I'm sure plenty of others here can do that for you.

       This is a Realtors listing, businesses are often sold with employees unaware that the business is being sold so they don't want them to find out from Joe Blow Realtor that they may be under a new owner soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is no floor plan because this is just general tax data. The city will have a full floor plan.

       Turns out Jose Solano works for both Salt Lake City Corporation and Chunga International, listed as a Provo business. Only trail of Chunga International is a pretty fake looking facebook page for what seems to be a construction company.  This just keeps getting shadier and more interesting!

       As a Reddit community, we can keep throwing out suggestions as to what it may be or try to go down the rabbit hole figuring it out on our own, or someone in the area can take some risks and do a thorough hands on investigation. I'm extremely curious &amp; I feel like all this digging around just keeps arising new possibilities. Only a few ways to be really sure.

       If no one goes in or out, try watching the people who frequent houses near the school. I know the idea's a tad "Scooby-Doo", but they could have access through a tunnel or drain to the day-care, from a nearby house.

       Facebook Page for A Chunga Company. Only company ive been able to find with that name so I assume its the same one. Written in the description is.
"Civil engineering,Road construction,projects,production,general contracts,consultant"
Also listed are several phone numbers.
"77508032 , 75728299, 77238863"
None of these seem to be valid american phone numbers. Maybe for fax or something but i have no way to tell.
9 pictures are posted on their page. 8 of these pictures are tagged as being in Adamaoua, Cameroon and show what seems to be several construction projects in that town. Album is titled "Work in progress with viettel cameroon sall"
9th picture is a tagged photo by a man named Mula Fordip Divine. Picture is of a slightly open metal cabinet on a faux wood wall with a door next to it. The Company commented saying "New Office". The cameroon photos were posted November 26 2013 while the office picture is dated May 4th 2014 making this picture the most recent activity in this group.
I also did some research into the names mentioned in the building album title. Viettel Mobile is the largest Phone service provider in Vietnam. I found mention of the cameroon company as follows.
"It won a contract in Cameroon in December 2012, which it bid for in a joint-venture with Bestinver Cameroon S.A.R.L."
This sentence cites this article in the Newspaper "Vietnam Voice."
       <a href="http://english.vov.vn/Economy/Viettel-gets-Cameroon-telecom-contract/251490.vov">

       </a>
       Chunga is not mentioned in either the Wiki article nor the newspaper article. This is probably a bit far fetched but there is mention of a Taiwanese Telecommunications company called Chungwa Telecom
"In May 2007 Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd. established a joint venture with Viettel Mobile to provide Internet data center services in Vietnam."
Most likely unrelated but the name similarity makes it worth mentioning.
Very little of note on the facebook page excluding that it has 11 likes (including myself) and has no text posts only photos.

       To be fair, a lot of overseas manufacturers are pretty terrible about keeping up with their web-presence. I work with a freight broker who has a terrible website and no social media presence, but they provide great service - It's just a small company.

       I work in a small company that does all of it's manufacturing in China, and you would be surprised how little is out there on some of our 3rd party manufacturers given how many millions of dollars in revenue they generate.

       At first I thought maybe people were just being a little too judgmental but after reading through all the evidence...it seems fishy as hell. Especially with that ditribribution of plastic jewelry....front for drug or people trafficing if I ever heard of one.

       After reading the original (now deleted) thread and everything else I could find regarding this Daycare, it seems to me like someone bought this place in 2006 with the intent on running a legit Daycare and simply got in over their heads. It looks like they simply failed to maintain the place the way it was ran before, and eventually their clients left as a reflection of the poor manner in which it was being run.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure the person who owns it now probably loves all of this negative attention and people implying that he's doing everything from laundering money to running a meth lab. That's exactly what you want people to think about your unsuccessful Daycare center.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, these threads and this "conspiracy" is simply a matter of kicking a guy when he's obviously already down. That's just my opinion though. And whether or not that one redditor who people found was ex-military and speaks 8 languages or whatever: first of all, who's to say if that guy really is affiliated with that place. For all we know, he could be blowing smoke. Or, maybe he actually owns the place and is trying to disuade people from calling his freaking Daycare center a shady cult in disguise, or a crack den, or whatever the latest off the wall conspiracy is.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: And now I see that I'm responding to a thread that is over a month old and everyone has probably forgotten all about this by now. FML. Hope I didn't reawaken a ridiculous "conspiracy" by trying to defend the place.

       Yeah that's what I mean. Seems hard to believe Police wouldn't notice a shady building like that for this long. They are trained in what to look for. A daycare center with no windows, fresh paint and no kids is a dead giveaway.

       what if you call the police and told them you heard screaming and then cursing telling the person to shut up and a loud bag and then silence? then the police would have no excuse but to go inside. someone can watch from afar to see if they do.

       Neighbors all pretty much say the same "That place is creepy" "I never see anyone there" "My kids don't like that place" type of stuff according to people from the area. And I'm not sure many people have the time or resources to pull a stakeout.

       Down the "street" from the NSA facility and the airport. The website match to Oaktown, VA is in between D.C and Dulles airport. They will probably pack up and move in the next couple months with so many inquiries.

       What are you referring to in your first 2 sentences? Sorry, not trying to be rude. If you are referring to the Day Care being "down the 'street'" from the NSA facility...it is a 30 minute drive away. I wouldn't consider that "down the street" at all. And what is your proposed connection to the NSA with all of this? How does this relate to the NSA? I don't understand what you're trying to get at.

       Just how near they are to certain government facilities. I definitely could have worded it better. I know that if you expand the radius of someplace you'll eventually hit a federal/state building but with the connection of the websites being similar and the VA one being so near to DC makes it an odd connection. So I remembered the NSA facility in Utah and checked out where it was. I've never been to the area so I don't know the distances timewise, but it's an interesting coincidence nonetheless. I just wanted to point it out.

       I'm not from either area but Google Maps estimates that the NSA Data Center is a 30 minute drive from the daycare...or a 7 hour and 51 minute walk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise with the DC connection to the VA address...45 minutes to an hour by car. I understand you're trying to make some sort of government connection to this but to be honest, this is not the way to go about that.

       If something in OP's story/the claims that have been made by other Redditors since then implicate a government agency, I would say, by all means, follow that lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just aimlessly looking to tie a (seemingly innocent, yet spooky looking) day care center to a government agency that specializes in computer surveillance and data collection is the kind of thing that makes people roll their eyes at "conspiracy theorists."  There's no intelligent reason to do so. There is only "well, I know they are in the same state...and...thats spooky!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say the best way to go about making a government connection to a supposed conspiracy is to NOT make a government connection to said conspiracy unless there is actually a reason to. In this case, there is no reason - other than the fact that somebody who MAY have something to do with ownership of the day care may also have been a webmaster for a company that worked on a local election campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: not everything is an NSA/FBI/CIA conspiracy.

       I am a BIG advocate of distrusting ALL parts of the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do NOT advocate is making random connections between private day cares and completely unrelated data collection centers that happen to be located in the same state. How do you not understand that? I was trying to be cordial with my initial responses to you but I guess there is no getting through to you.

       This is why people can't stand modern day "conspiracy theorists." Most people who identify as such would rather just blame everything on spoopy government agencies than use their brain to connect facts....and this is coming from somebody who is very critical of our government! You need to learn when it is appropriate to draw such connections, otherwise you are throwing the entire movement under the bus with your ignorance.

It is right down the "street" [actually 40 blocks away] from the FBI's downtown headquarters...and also down the "street" [actually 35 blocks away] from The Disney Store! Must be some kind of FBI controlled MK Ultra Illuminati Pedophile ring going on!

       I cannot find a physical address for Miller Heights Coop. Also the description on that website of Oakton is not correct. There is no historic district on Oakton, no downtown, and the only museum is a 1 room historic schoolhouse. It appears to be another fake day care. I grew up less than 1 mile from the center of Oakton.

       That is not their real site...that is just some random ad site that went up once their real site went down. Thats been there for days, and the NJ thing is just a related search/site placed there just like all of the rest.

       But why what? Nobody knows why they ditched their website and scrubbed the Whois info within hours of them being discussed on here. That is part of the mystery. As for the page that currently exists..that is an extremely typical format for a dead webpage and a way for whoever still owns the domain to attempt to collect ad revenue from clicks to other sites while not actively running the site themselves. It is really common across the net, I am surprised you've never seen a junk page like that before.

       Small theory here on the odd color of the building!
Okay, so we know that mysteriously large shipments are being delivered to said building, correct?
And that these shipments are more than likely coming from China.
Perhaps, due to the language barrier, the building was painted to stand out to delivery-men, preventing confusion with directions? I don't know, I just thought it was odd.

       Read everything from top to bottom.  My gut feeling is shipping of kids to china.  The one thing that really gets me is the location of the bounce place in oregon.  Just a lot with no building where the company is.  But it's obvious people are driving there because you can see the turn off from the road to the right

       JUST TO CLEAR SOME THINGS UP about my self.  Become a linguist, instant TS clearance. Pass the DLAB over a 150 your going to take a trip to some places (that's all I am going to say.) My brain is wired for languages. Can I read all of them? no, Can I speak them, yes. I have an audio graphic memory It is very easy for me to remember words and things that are verbally said with 94% recall. I am white.I am not Hindi or Pakistani I grew up in Vermont. Moved to utah in my late high school years. Graduated early with packets. joined the Airforce at 17years old. I was not stationed at A51 I was only there for like a week. (Can not say anymore than that) Am I involved in this day care stuff? No, Hell no. Its just In my experience From what I was doing after the USAF. These places are bad news. Its easy to identify when something is up. no one walking in or out of the doors, lack of change for decades, etc. and since the thread I have done my own research. as for the people calling me a phoney because I am 24 and I bothered to actually seize the opportunities that were in front of me learned those languages went to A51 and jumped out of airplanes for a living for 4 years doesn't mean it isn't possible. I have seen some seriously fucked up shit, It wasn't a cake walk. DLI,Jump school, S.E.R.E school, and Goodfellow AFB. did someone fuck up my DD214? I think so but I have to go to DC with a Lawyer to have a chance at that to get changed.

       Don't listen to this guy. I was an Arabic Linguist in the Marine Corps. He didn't get a fucking 162 on the DLAB. A 120 is considered Godly. Sure he can be smart, but a 162? Get fucking real. I think 164 is a perfect score.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't do all those schools. I mean each of the languages takes over a year of class. Arabic alone takes two years from start till you finish and get to your duty station. And NOBODY learns more than one lang in an enlistment. And why such a weird combo? If you learn an Abrahamic language, you stick to them. Urdu, pashtu, farsi, arabic? I get that. But fucking Russian and french? Stop. They just wouldn't have you do that. Plus SERE, jump, and wtf ever else his is lying about... Another 6+ months each. He is simply too young to have done all that. Plus area 51?!?! The fuck?!?! Never once was the possibility to go 51 brought up by any other linguist I ever met. There is simply nothing there at all for a linguist to do.

       I guess he fell on hard times at some point, because two years ago, despite all this amazing top-secret military training, he said he worked at a coffee shop:

       Not to mention he says he's not "Hindi or Pakistani." Hindi is a language, not a nationality/ethnicity. If he could actually speak hindi &amp;amp; all those other related languages, he would know something as simple as that

       By the way, how hard it to get into being a linguist in marine corps? I've been considering it for some years

       It's all about the DLAB. Get a 100 or better you should be good. 110 and you are definitely in, as long as you qualify for a TS clearance, which you do with no drug charges/significant debt/obvious ties to foreign governments.

       I've always been called a "smart" guy, but don't really consider myself to be all that bright.

       The Corps definitely needs them, and your recruiter would do everything he could to get you in.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to take the ASVAB to get your GT score first, and if it's high enough, 90 i think, you can take the DLAB. Good luck dude/ette, hit me up if you have any questions.

       Yeah your right one language. but, the F.L.P.P was way too much to stop at just Urdu the DLAB perfect score is 179. average DLI student 100.  Hindi urdu punjabi are very similar. German was my first language. S.E.R.E is not 6 months.  joined the AF at 17.

       Don't believe him. I was a linguist in the Marine Corps. No fucking way he got a 162 on the DLAB. Highest I ever heard of was a 130 or so, and that dude was a language whizz.

       He is romanticizing being a linguist, it's not that cool.

       And what reason would that be? It's not like you go to some special language school. I've been too DLI east, too.

       Maaaaybe you were a ling. Maybe. But this whole "super amazing special linguist doing shit no other linguist in history has done" shit is garbage. It's probably more likely that you tried to, washed out, got re-classed to analyst, and know just enough to concoct a bullshit story that 90% of the people on reddit wouldn't know enough about to call you out on.

       They are dangerous places to be around. And now people are being stupid peering into the windows trying to send pizza there. Now, they know they are being watched. And if there were an investigation going on we made the investigators lives a lot harder.

       What I do NOT advocate is making random connections between private day cares and completely unrelated data collection centers that happen to be located in the same state. How do you not understand that? I was trying to be cordial with my initial responses to you but I guess there is no getting through to you.

       This is why people can't stand modern day "conspiracy theorists." Most people who identify as such would rather just blame everything on spoopy government agencies than use their brain to connect facts....and this is coming from somebody who is very critical of our government! You need to learn when it is appropriate to draw such connections, otherwise you are throwing the entire movement under the bus with your ignorance.

       Not to do anything to dismiss the overall creepiness of this whole debacle, but a lot of daycares here in Chicago (that I've seen in nice neighborhoods where I lived) would have decals or artwork completely covering all the windows. My best guess is that it's for the children's safety, as anyone (predators, parent with custody battle, etc.) could come and watch the kids through the windows otherwise.

       Hes listed as Principal. (not owner? but hes thee owner)  However theres several listings for Sam shaw at other companies on that page, maybe different ones but in oregon same name same age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sam Shaw is the owner.  The business address seems to be an empty lot in the woods.

       Possible it might be off a little but images were taken recently far as i can tell (2015) and theres nothing there. It is registered as a 4 bedroom house built in 1991. I cant see one and theres nothing around that looks like a bouncy castle business. Its possible this is the mailing address and the business is somewhere else i suppose but even so theres no house there according to google. Their website does say they have ponies so perhaps they are there but i dont see anything.  And the names on the properties dont match.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the tax records i got this

       its registered to Keenan Benjamin INC. (this is getting strange)
33 acres of property. No business there. Its registereed as farmland.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked up the adreess listed on the tax site and it doesnt exist. There is a street in Salem with a similar address but is not exactly right.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS IS INTERESTING!

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon further search i found that Funland Inc founded by this " Sam Shaw" was at this address and it is listed as GUESS WHAT....
      </p>
      <p>
       A child daycare service.
      </p>
      <p>
       not a bouncy castle place. this is getting really fucked up now.
       <a href="http://or.mingluji.com/business_directory/Funland_Inc">
        http://or.mingluji.com/business_directory/Funland_Inc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The place is suppose to be closed and according to a couple searches is actually a single family home being rented to a man. ( wont post his name) hes been there for 4 years.  There is a woman listed at the same adress with a different last name. Possible girlfriend i guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know what else is interesting... this is close proximity to an elementary school.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if what i gather may be right this is a small house that was listed as a daycare years back and run out of a home, (if its not just a shell corp which is likely) or the person living there before used this address for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       However all the properties this "Sam Shaw" is associated with as owning DO NOT EXIST.  They are listed under other peoples names and addresses but listed as businesses with those address. He has several.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy is definatly hiding something weird. All of the businesses that name is associated with is tied to children.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a sex offender listed as the same name from another state that they apparently dont know where he is. (not saying its the same guy just coincidence)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/directory/us/oregon/aumsville/shaws-interiors-10173-keene-ln-se/">
        http://www.ibegin.com/directory/us/oregon/aumsville/shaws-interiors-10173-keene-ln-se/
       </a>
       now hes an interior rug store.. and party store.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR 
Same guy now apparently has a Carpet store.. that is also a party supply store.. that is also interior design.. that is also a kids party place.. that is also a bouncy castle place thats also a farm at the same address,
      </p>
      <p>
       that's not in his name (shell company that doesnt exist) whose address is actually a mobile home in a different town, whose associated to a child day care, whose also tied to a shipping company, thats tied to the other weird companies thats tied to sex offenders and possible trafficking.

       Too many examples in this thread.  What, you think that if a group was collaborating in an act as disgusting and nefarious as human trafficking they wouldn't make an effort towards covering it up?  Actually, if I had to pick one example I'd pick the shilling towards the daycare.  If they were legit, they wouldn't need to do that and certainly wouldn't go towards the effort.

       They really aren't. At the very least there are huge dialectic differences aside fro. the cultural connotations. Indians say they speak Hindi and Pakistanis say they speak Urdu. Try and convince either that they're speaking the other and see what happens.

       what if you call the police and told them you heard screaming and then cursing telling the person to shut up and a loud bag and then silence? then the police would have no excuse but to go inside. someone can watch from afar to see if they do.

       Except there's tons of literature on projects that occurred there that were written by people who in fact WERE employees.

       I mean, I assume you're correct in that there ARE people who can't speak in detail about their involvement in projects, but it would appear that such a stipulation hinges on the nature of the work and if it is still classified.

       The age isn't the fundamentally relative quality. It's the fact that they're declassified. If the poster worked on something that has since been declassified, I see no reason he couldn't talk about his/her service at Groom Lake.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's moot anyway, because people disclose classified information all the time, regardless of how high profile the pertinent entity or project is.

       Urdu uses cognates from other languages like Farsi and Arabic most people who speak Hindi may understand Urdu but are unable to read it or understand a few words. For instance the word for family in Urdu is خاندان "Khandan" But in Hindi it is परिवार "Parivāra" most can understand each other. Also Urdu is kind of a bitch because it is not that standardized. in Punjab they may use more Hindi based Urdu where as in Baluchistan your going to get a lot of Farsi in there. they are not the same language but they are very close to each other. Urdu is a hindi based language due to its grammatical structure simple words are going to be the same but the more specified the words like medical terminology is going to be Farsi. religious colloquialisms are going to be arabic.

       I think it's VERY odd that a container coming from China landed in Vriginia and not in California... Logisticaly it doesn't add up... I've personally only ever dealt with ports in TX, NY and CA. CA ports (again, in my expereince) want to do ever examination possible on every single container that goes through. X-ray, tail gate, and sometimes, even more detailed than that. Doesn't matter how good your papers look or how long you've been bringing the same shit in from the same place they always want to get in there and finger fuck everything. Maybe the port in VA is a little more relaxed?

       Mine too.  We just need to be careful because those are very serious accusations and as of right now the evidence is pretty minimal.  So for now I reserve judgement and just hold onto my questions and suspicions.

       That's the problem, it's been shown time and time again that these international pedophile rings are protected by law enforcement, politicians, and the media, so what do you do?  I think the answer lies in the rest of us, especially those who have no idea about stories like this.

        The "reason" is the various abnormalities of the building, schedule, shipments, and lack of children or activity.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nothing wrong with the building. Might be a little outdated and haggard but I have seen trailers used as day cares before. You are not going to get the schedule of the facility unless you have a child there, that is common sense since it prevents pedos from stalking the place.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2u343a/the_slc_day_care_shipping_container_and/co4t2yl">
        The shipment has nothing to do with the day care check out my post here
       </a>
       . There was children activity taken by a redditor.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The "paper trail" reinforces the notion that there is improper documentation and insufficient available information regarding the establishment as a childcare center, not to mention all the odd shipments as noted in the OP.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What kind of paper trail would you like? The day care is obviously a day care cited by the numerous fines they have had over the years (which are quite high but not completely out of the norm). Again, the shipment has nothing to do with the day care at all.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At the very least, it would be important to verify that the building is up to code, and that all regulations are met or exceeded as a registered child care center.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Meh, no one is really going to give a shit for the most part. This is a day care located in not so great area of SLC. While it may not be 100% or a place you bring your kid they are certified to receive kids through the government services. That would be impossible to do if they were not suitable.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's no harm in an audit, given that we're talking about children.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree there is no harm to audit but when you are calling, sending pizzas, taking creepy pictures through the windows, and stalking the place it becomes a concern of safety for the children. You are more likely to be arrested for stalking or whatever than this place to be shut down for being unsuited for children.
