       I have not seen anything related to alternative energy devices/solutions posted. Which can be a subreddit of its own (i mean like cold-fusion,etc. not just solar panels).
What patents are energy giants hiding from the public? What is your opinion on this subject in general. Wireless electricity theories etc. Just share here please.

       I am still disappointed in the bio-diesel movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making fuel off of the West's insatiable appetite for fast-food (indirectly by using an output of theirs as an input for another thing) seems like a perfect symbiotic thing to do, and dare I say it kind of socially Darwinian (adaptation wise?).

       It's nonsense. You can have an extremely efficient system that runs for a very long time with little energy, but you cannot have one that runs forever or gains energy on its own.

       I don't thnk I've actually ever seen anyone (sanely) suggest this. Usually the free energy stuff I see is about tapping into sources of energy that are large enough that relative to our needs would be considered endless. I think zero-point energy is one of this type. It's the energy that holds the fabric of the universe together, so it's all around us. It's not infinite but it's a big enough pool to basically be considered infinite.
      </p>
      <p>
       (and I'm not suggesting zero point is legit, just using it as an illustration)

       I'm making the distinction between natural energy of the sun, and the free-energy that nutbags go on about which involves things like perpetual motion machines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the difference being that the sun is limited. So it's gonna 'burn out' eventually, whereas the nutbags think they can make a wheel spin forever and connect a generator to it for free energy.

       I would love to hear more about these extremely efficient systems. I don't mind that you don't believe "free" energy exists. I think free is a vague concept. 50years ago, i am sure some viewed Atomic energy as "free".

       We are incredibly close to nailing photosynthesis, reverse engineering it into an energy producing machine harnessing the suns powers like nothing else before.. If nothing else, solar panels are getting increasingly better every year.  Good times we are living in..i think.

       I heard of an invention to modify a cars fuel system and heat the fuel up before it goes into the combustion chamber resulting in huge increases in mpg due to the fact less fuel got used. Something to do with expanding the fuel and wasting less.

       What i meant was that there with combustion engines a lot of heat is wasted, even more so, it has to be cooled. Heat is readily available for a fuel line to be heated before hand.

       Supposedly it worked by super-vaporizing the gasoline using steam. The principle is that gas only burns as vapor, so a ton of it goes out the exhaust unburned. Thats what the catalytic converters are for, burning up the gas that wasn't burned in the engine. If you can vaporize the gas more, you get more use out of it and less is wasted.

       I'm open to the possibility that some ancient civilizations had far greater understanding of electromagnetism than we give them credit for. I've seen some documentaries that propose that the Pyramids were capable of harnessing electrical power from the Earth itself. There's also some evidence that Nikolai Tesla rediscovered some of the ancient knowledge.

       It makes some sense in that the

        principles

       of the theory are known to work. And we also know that the ancient people were utilizing electricity for some purposes yet unknown, as evidenced by the discovery of ancient batteries.

       No one would have believed that the ancient Greeks were capable of building an intricate mechanical computer if the Antikythera mechanism had never been found.

       Academia seems rather apt to dismiss anything that doesn't fit with the notion that modern humans are smarter than the ancients, when it's clear that they had insights into things about the cosmos that we are only now rediscovering some inkling of.

       It's not that they could never have built it, so much as nothing had previously pointed to them building such a machine. And on top of this, the mechanism did not use electricity.

       Nobody ever claims that ancient humans were idiots (except people like Von Daniken who actively claim they could not have built anything). Just look at the Mayan's knowledge of astronomy, and with other civilizations, the large number of mathematical advancement, and the impressive feats of engineering (although both of these apply to the Mayans also). Nobody ever claimed they were stupid, but is is a little out there to claim they were actually more advanced than modern humans, especially sing our modern civilizations are direct descendants of said previous civilizations.
