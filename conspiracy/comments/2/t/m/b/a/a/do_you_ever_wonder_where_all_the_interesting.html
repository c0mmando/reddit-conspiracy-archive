    <div class="md"><p>What exactly is the deal with labeling people that are not really interested in changing the narrative of holocaust and then the other term of holocaust denial is absurd. We all know that it happened.  </p>

<p>Contrails are real as well. We know for a fact that the us government has used aerosol forms of chemicals to test on a population in MO back in the day. Is it so far fetched the think they wouldn&#39;t be doing it with commercial airliners now?</p>

<p>As for anti vax we did do them with out son because they do have a positive effect. I cant say either way mainly cause different chemicals have adverse reactions on some people. And you wont know till its too late. </p>

<p>The whole arguing is pointless for the groups of &quot;shills&quot; I mean why do so many throw that word around in here. Is it just a easier was to type asshole because so many are too lazy to type out a longer word?</p>

<p>I would like to think some just are lonely and want to get attention so this is how they get messages on reddit. Or maybe others just wanna start an argument because they are assholes. Who know but I have never called someone a shill. </p>

<p>From what I understand it is a person that has a primary interest in shifting public view for a company because they are receiving some kind of compensation.  I mean wow that is really a harsh word to use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? You know of some of the complete atrocities that the us government has done to its own population yet you cant even acknowledge that chemtrails are a remote possibly? </p>

<p>Its far more plausible that its a real thing that is happening.  I try not to immediately discount many scenarios I see in here involving the government of any country I see in here. </p>

<p>The problem I always find is that for every one I find there is another that either downright denies its merit or one that has a slightly different story. </p>

<p>Its up to you as a critical thinking person to make up your own mind. When you deny it altogether without even listening to both sides it makes you a fool. </p>

<p>Thats my opinion.  And that is all it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because putting any chemicals for spraying from a commercial airline would require thousands of people keeping the secret, nobody looking out a window, and others to install sprayers...somewhere in the plane that nobody could see from the terminal. </p>

<p>Also, there have been zero studies that have shown that the contrails from commercial airplanes contain any of the weird chemicals the believers claim are in there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet the Manhattan project was kept secret for so long. </p>

<p>There are examples of compartmentization thruout many projects. So maybe just maybe it isnt on commercial airliners. How about on the Janet flights that leave Vegas airport? Or a great deal of other flights that are done.</p>

<p>Just trying to open your mind up to the possibility of different ways it could be accomplished. </p>

<p>Say like the reason I dont think terrorism is a real threat. Take the towers falling it killed over 3000 people ok. Now if I was to have the inclination of an act to fuck up a country and I could get a nuke why would I waste my time and resources to smuggle it into a country? </p>

<p>It would most definitely get intercepted before it reached its intended target. And if you think these terrorist cant get a nuke because we have all the bases covered you are mistaken. There are so many places out there that hate USA for all kinds of reasons that would love us tk get fucked. They would help them.</p>

<p>So back to destabilizing our way of life in USA with a terrorist act.  What I would do is have a ship and travel a few hundred miles out and detonate the nuke underwater in order to cause a tidle wave that would wipe out the west or east coast. </p>

<p>Think about how much more effective that would be. I mean in am not the smartest person and my idea might not work. But that&#39;s an idea and a plausible one. But we only see small events that are not really disruptions to our long term ways of life or production from an act of terrorism.</p>

<p>Instead we see how they kill themself in order to accomplish the act. Ie being a martyr.  So we can associate a boogie man with the enemy. Now think if we were just hit with a natural disaster that is man made and saw no way to prevent it.</p>

<p>The psychological impact would strike into each person across the globe and we wouldn&#39;t go to work. We wouldnt function and isnt that what a real terrorist wants?</p>

<p>These are the types of things in my head. </p>
