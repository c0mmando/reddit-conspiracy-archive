Based on the true story of journalist Gary Webb. </p>

<p>Based on the True story of Journalist Gary Webb. The film takes place in the mid 1990s, when Webb uncovered the CIA&#39;s past role in importing huge amounts of cocaine into the U.S. that was aggressively sold in ghettos across the country to raise money for the Nicaraguan Contras rebel army. Despite enormous pressure not to, Webb chose to pursue the story and went public with his evidence, publishing the series &quot;Dark Alliance&quot;. As a result he experienced a vicious smear campaign fueled by the CIA. At that point Webb found himself defending his integrity, his family, and his life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is possible for a suicide victim to shoot twice. The first shot may not complete the job - hence the second. However, I have seen no autopsy of Gary Webb so the &#39;suicided&#39; angle is still a possibility for me. He was no doubt driven out of the profession he loved, but he was a capable man who could have made a living by other means. If he were around now, he would be a well known and respected voice on the subject. So if (and I mean if) he did commit suicide a lesson can be learned for those of us going through tough times - &quot;This too shall pass&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It happens in a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_gunshot_suicide">percentage of suicides</a> (2%). The Wikipedia entry on it is not properly sourced and lists 3.6% as the number. The only document with proper sourcing attributes multiple gunshot wounds as cause of suicide in only 2% of cases.</p>

<p>In these cases, the suicide victim usually flinches at the last moment, causing the bullet to miss the critical part of the brain.</p>

<p>It&#39;s suspicious as hell, but it&#39;s not outside the realm of possibility that Gary Webb did in fact commit suicide.</p>

<p>I believe that his suicide is secondary to his reporting. He was one of the finest investigative journalists of our time -- the fact that the state can crush the career of someone like Webb should terrify everyone. We don&#39;t need a secondary conspiracy when the first is so apparent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>true, you&#39;re not wrong BUT! I must say that smayonak did bring up 2 good points. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s not impossible for Mr. Webb to have needed two bullets to kill himself.</p></li>
<li><p>the state has the capability to put a serious dent into a man&#39;s career, which yes, is kinda terrifying. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Embedded in all this though is the media&#39;s potential to twist &amp;manipulate stories as well as the rogue status of some of our national organizations (mainly the CIA), both of which I believe to be serious problems that threaten our livelihoods more than any &quot;terrorist&quot; ever will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even so, it&#39;s statistically much more likely that death by two bullet wounds to the head is the result of a murder as opposed to a suicide.  Take all people who&#39;ve died from two bullets to the head and I would be willing to bet that well over 90% of them were murdered.  And then compound this with who Gary was, the type of work he was doing, and the fact that he himself stated multiple times that he wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he were to be killed and I think it&#39;s fairly safe to say that it&#39;s significantly <em>more likely</em>, given the circumstances, that he was murdered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than one round with one trigger use is the <a href="http://www.atf.gov/content/firearms/firearms-industry/guides/national-firearms-act-machinegun">legal definition of machinegun</a>.  What you mistakenly reference by moving the above goalpost from &quot;one pull = 2 bullets&quot; to &quot;professional shooter with custom gun&quot; is commonly known as bumpfiring - which is impossible with a revolver.  Let alone possible of being performed by a person into their own head.</p>

<p>I can see why you&#39;d downvote this if you start with a preconceived notion of something else and haven&#39;t bothered familiarizing yourself with any facts though.  Seriously, shot twice in the head with a .38 revolver - not an autoloading semi-automatic and definitely not some sort of revolver-machinegun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>first shot doesn&#39;t kill you. ever heard of fight club and how the main characters last scene was based on a real event that happened. Plus i have to agree just not with the CIA thing, there they got it wrong. see my mom knew Senro Pablo Escobar, and towards the middle to end of his rain, no less. See she a group of people that was help the women how got Escobar into the drug business, realized that he was not going with what they had intened for him to go with, sell a shit ton of cocaine and fund a rebel group near major south american city to disablement  the region, thus allowing to those groups of people to help stabilize those region for large amounts of money. You can look for yourself that towards when his end all his property and money was confiscated or detained and then from there it never left the south Americas, insteade it was spilt to small amounts to so call recoperate the damage he did&quot; but turely it never saw the light of day sort of speak. instead it was given to known corupted government officals in the hopes of the use it wisely&quot;. you can also look at that for yourself, as to who took power after he left, yes the govenrment took the cocaine but they never burned all of it, only a small amount. once you look at the footage of the days that they were doing it you&#39;d notice that most of the fire is like normal colored fire, when in really cocaine bure a light blueish color, which if someone we&#39;re to burn say 25 tons of cocoaine, we would have a lager bluer fire going, reasoning behind this is the fact cocaine causes fire to burn hotter, when mixed the sourounding of which Pablo had his worksite set up. see he had all his sites rigged so that if it was ever conpermised then it would burn all evidence so that no ties would be followed back to him since he was trying really hard to get into the Colombia government so he could pay the nation debt it had going on, which comes to my second reason why i agree with the above, see Pablo start a campaign to pay off Colombia&#39;s national debt and to the group of people that help out the women who introduced Pablo into the business was like a punch to the gut, see they expected that the guy she had coming next would go with the plan to sell cocaine and fund the rebel, but Pablo didn&#39;t, and on top of that he tried to get into the government to accomplish this, but when the got wind of this they had to stop him. they even tried to get a informant into the government themselves with the help of the Women (sorry forgetting the name) but the reason that Pablo turn on their plan was because of her, so their mistake was Pablo&#39;s gain as she warned him of this an killed the guy. in the end the we&#39;re forced to involve the C.I.A and D.E.A and turn on him bad. </p>

<p>Some percentage of deaths ruled as suicide are probably not actually suicides</p>

    <div class="md"><p>true, you&#39;re not wrong BUT! I must say that smayonak did bring up 2 good points. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s not impossible for Mr. Webb to have needed two bullets to kill himself.</p></li>
<li><p>the state has the capability to put a serious dent into a man&#39;s career, which yes, is kinda terrifying. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Embedded in all this though is the media&#39;s potential to twist &amp;manipulate stories as well as the rogue status of some of our national organizations (mainly the CIA), both of which I believe to be serious problems that threaten our livelihoods more than any &quot;terrorist&quot; ever will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even so, it&#39;s statistically much more likely that death by two bullet wounds to the head is the result of a murder as opposed to a suicide.  Take all people who&#39;ve died from two bullets to the head and I would be willing to bet that well over 90% of them were murdered.  And then compound this with who Gary was, the type of work he was doing, and the fact that he himself stated multiple times that he wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he were to be killed and I think it&#39;s fairly safe to say that it&#39;s significantly <em>more likely</em>, given the circumstances, that he was murdered.</p>
