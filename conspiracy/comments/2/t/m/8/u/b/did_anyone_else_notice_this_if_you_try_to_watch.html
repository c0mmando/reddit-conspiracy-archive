       tested this numerous times in the past year. the alternative video will hang and keep trying loading in a tab browser while I can play numerous fluffy cats in another tab without any problem whatsoever.

      <p>
       is the new internet paradigm. Since one law of web say that people attention span is very short and they get annoyed even faster, just create them some little annoyances like this and they will move on from the "dangerous" video to something that doesn't represent a problem to the system.

      <p>
       that damn trailer works like a charm in crazy quality, Corbett face is loading and loading at 144p for the past half hour (even closed the tab and opened the video numerous times, still the same problem):

       edit 2: the above links may work fine for you, this is done at user level. they don't block a video globally. this is not about the two videos above off course.

       Is this a serious thread?

      <p>
       Because I feel like I'm being trolled.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're comparing a video with 5 000 views to a video with 9 000 000 views.
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube is built on a cloud storage solution. This means that a video might be uploaded to a server in one country, and then distributed to servers in other countries gradually, depending on demand (historical and projected).
      </p>
      <p>
       So the first video you linked is not popular, and especially may not be popular in your region. Thus you are either stuck streaming it from a low-priority foreign server, or only a few low-res versions have been distributed to your nearby nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second video is popular, likely watched by people from around the world. But it's also uploaded by a channel account with over a million subscribers and which routinely gets millions of views on its videos, which means that YouTube will prioritize it for global distribution so that they can meet the projected demand for the video.

       A lot of the content I watch is from people in the US, Canada, and Europe, all with &lt;500,000 subscribers. There is a significant difference in buffer times depending on who I'm watching.

       Also, the alternative media video is 45:46 minutes long, while the American Sniper trailer is 2:18 minutes. This can also play a role on an older computer or slower internet connection.

       I disagree. I think you're watching videos of low popularity and narrow distribution and perceive a conspiracy when there is nothing more malicious than a cloud distribution algorithm at work.*
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to provide evidence to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       *  The reason you are getting poor performance is that you are streaming a video from a server far a way, and YouTube considers it low priority compared to people who are watching more popular content, thus your loading time gets horrendously long, and packets lost means that you will experience stuttering in video and audio. You can get almost the same effect by trying to watch a video from a popular channel minutes after it uploads. Call it a conspiracy if you wish, but YouTube doesn't have infinite storage or infinite bandwidth, and the internet is not infinitely efficient, so compromises have to be made to get as good a service as possible for as many users as possible, and sometimes that does not include you.

       Its so clearly explained here... but no, there will always be a reason why someone is special. Please keep in mind that often, popularity and content go hand in hand. /u palinola explained perfectly what is happening, and should be answered with "ah, I didn't realize that's how YouTube worked. Thanks for explaining." But that just wouldn't be exciting.

       it doesn't work like this. This is made at user level, so your experience with the same video will not be the same as mine. This to avoid the obvious danger in having people pointing fingers at a blatant censorship of one video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine one video getting globally blocked. One can post a link and say "Hey they blocked that! Censorship! Censorship!"
      </p>
      <p>
       So is more subtle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is easy to check if you know to analyze what are the meaning of the videos and which one can be a danger to the system. You can recognize this and try again and again to see that particular video till it works. You can insist because you want to see the content you are not trying to be "wake up" by that video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is very effective to people that happen to pass by that particular content that have no clue about the argument. They will say "Fuck it! it doesn't work" and move to another video. Danger of "waking up" avoided.

       If I linked to you the patent that Google owns, that specifically describes this preferential behavior, in detail, and even warns of quality degradation whilst accessing less-than popular-records, would you accept that maybe this is observational bias in the face of ignorance of cloud architecture, or would you still play the victim?

       This is very fascinating if true, considering the recent thread on here about how many of the biggest companies were secretly manipulated and funded by the American government, one of the more notable ones being Google.  A conspiracy theory is formed from correlating facts that provide evidence to a seemingly intentionally hidden idea, and this seems to be exactly that.

       There is an explanation for this though, youtube pre-caches videos on it's servers based on how many times the video is seen per day, as you probably know "fluffy cat" videos get a lot more views than "alternative media" ones.

       Google/youtube manipulates what's seen more than people think. I've been producing videos on youtube since 2006 and the shit google has been pulling to control the flow of information is insane. What's incredible is that you can see it happening in real time if you keep close track of adsense/revenue and your youtube stats.

       Just a coincidence. I used to think stuff like that too. I would read some conspiracy stuff online and then, my browser would freeze or stuff like that. You think they would throttle certain types of material. I don't see the point.

       Well, for one the Corbrett video is plus 40 minutes, and the American Sniper vid is 03:00. So Corbrett will take longer because of of its file size. They both played fine for me with the exception of loading time.

       You're right - because if YouTube is indeed giving some videos or
       <em>
        types
       </em>
       of videos preference (effectively discriminating against others), it is an INTERNAL decision of how they handle the data on their own servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're right - it's NOT a "net neutrality" thing - but it offers a taste of what the Net will look like if net neutrality is abandoned.
