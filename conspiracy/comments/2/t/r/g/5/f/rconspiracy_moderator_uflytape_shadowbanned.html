       Find one single example of a comment I deleted ever, it shouldn't be hard since pretty much everything I submit is immediately archived by SRD or duckvimes.

       No, that was when I mentioned the obvious "swarmfront" gaming of this sub, and you banned me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you told me, "If you want to go fuck yourself now I'm sure SRS would let you borrow a variety of dildos" after I asked why I was banned, even though I never have taken a pro SRS or SJW stance.  I'm just for the white supremacy bullshit to stay in its own subs, without spilling into discussions of conspiracies.

       What you actually did was attack the OP because of his unpopular beliefs, which you failed to mention or quote when you sort of explained to AP why I banned you in SRD.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's okay, I'm fine with you being unbanned as long as you follow the rules going forward.  People have done far worse than you and have been given a 2nd chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as far as the white rights people being barred from participating in conspiracy, that isn't going to happen.  They have just as much right as you have to comment wherever they want.  You don't get to make choices like that.

       As long as they follow our rules, as long as anyone follows our rules, they can participate here.  End of story.

       I didn't "attack op"  I just pointed out that he obviously was part of the swarmfront brigade.  I'm sure he didnt lose any sleep over it.  And my ban actually came well after that comment when I pointed out that you were replying pretty snidely to people.  You went through my posting history, found something you thought would violate the rules, and then banned me for it to protect your own ego.
      </p>

       At least the other mods saw through that and unbanned me.

      <p>
       Westboro Baptists are "dedicated and passionate." ISIS insurgents are "dedicated and passionate."
      </p>
      <p>
       Dedication and passion do not a good mod make, in and of themselves. Those two traits
       <em>
        enhance
       </em>
       a person who has good skills in moderation - namely, conflict resolution (Flytape would
       <em>
        start
       </em>
       conflicts), mediation (Flytape would consistently take sides in disputes), and - most importantly - even application of the sub's rules in a fair manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sweet heebus, was Flytape bad on that last one. Mass bans for anyone who dared show dissent (see: XKCD Kerfuffle), comment nukes, and generally childish attitude when it came down to people contesting bans.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a good mod. He was a
       <em>
        fanatical
       </em>
       mod, which might be mistaken for quality if you squint at it funny, but in the end his behavior was detrimental. Now, as a user? Sure, those traits made him a great user and a major contributor. However, as is true in a lot of hierarchies - be they military, political, or communal - sometimes the best members of the community are not necessarily the best suited to
       <em>
        lead
       </em>
       it.

       And so do military generals with twitchy fingers on the "nuke everything" button, but just because the job's done doesn't mean it's done well, or even in a manner that facilitates a good conclusion to the problem at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Clean the sub out" of who? By Flytape's track record, I can only assume you're referring to anyone who doesn't go with the hivemind? Because that's who Flytape banned - people asking for statistics, people asking for sources (besides Russian state-sponsored media and Neocities text pages), people
       <em>
        disagreeing
       </em>
       with the day's latest assertion of evildoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose I should expound on what I said earlier - dedication and passion for a subject are
       <em>
        enhancing
       </em>
       traits, not good or bad of their own accord. You can be passionate, but being a passionate KKK advocate isn't necessarily a good thing. You can be dedicated, but being dedicated to genocide advocacy isn't a good thing, either. Conversely, you can be the reincarnation of Jesus himself, but lacking conviction to your cause you're no better than a random dude on the street who "thought about working in a soup kitchen once."
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, a good users - or moderator - must be dedicated and passionate. Why
       <em>
        else
       </em>
       would anyone want the fucking job? I've done it, it sucks (hell, it's what led to me getting doxxed). But those traits
       <em>
        alone
       </em>
       do not a quality moderator make; they merely enable the traits that
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       make a good moderator better. Skills such as impartiality, administration, and - most importantly - goddamn professionalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moderators who - with regularity - call those they ban "faggots" pretty much fail that third element.

       Absolutely I can. Back when it was actually about more than israel, jews, and the holocaust. These days you get shadowbanned by flycock if you suggest that the jews are not satans minions on earth. So excuse me if I find this a reason for jubilant celebration and lets toast to the dream that the ignorant trailer trash never comes back.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Im sorry "my friends are jewish" is fucking hilarious.  If you are going to say that you are not the one pushing holocaust revisionist films and bullshit, then ok, if thats your story now.... Lets hope you keep it that way.

        [1] mod in December of 2014. However, I've been posting conspiracy-related material to reddit since early 2007. Can you say the same?

       I wasn't particularly fond of him, especially his moderating style. He seemed super quick with the ban hammer. I guess you have to be in this sub, but it really tends to rub people the wrong way when you harass them and ban them before they get a chance to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO this sub is better without him.

       Agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disagreeing with other users, and calling them out on their BS using logic and science: banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       His reasoning: You should let people say what they want without being attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I can see his point of wanting to create a safe place for fringe topics, stifling legit opposing views and comments by rampantly banning people is absurd, and overwhelmingly damaging to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I believe the guy had good intentions in the beggining, and can kind of feel for the guy. He is too quick to ban people, and seems a bit too.. well, paranoid, at the moment (probably from the stress of moderating a crazy place like this). It is probably a good idea for him to take a break from moderating for a while.

       Its the way you go about it that makes the difference.
attacking a person's character vs attacking the view point. If i was an mod I would be banning any and all attacks on peoples character. It doesn't bring healthy discussions and just ends up sidetracking the issue. An important point that people tend to forget is its that people deliberately use character attacks to distract from the real issues. Those are the kinds of people that dont need to have a voice. You want to talk about something talk about the issues.

       Except that he has been shown to ban people for simply disagreeing with other members, time and time again. Not personal attacks,  just differing opinions.

       It's easy to tell where power doesn't belong when the power is literally unchangable by the people whom that power is granted over. You are on record saying "I will never step down no matter what" more or less.

       This thread alone shows that a majority dislikes you having power over them.

       How convenience that you can just disregard that every single thread about you contains a majority of people who don't want you having mod power. Yet this 'magical secret smart people' are smart enough to know something else.

       No.. we both know what it actually means when you said "I will not step down... no matter what"

       It means you have no interest in anything except having the power.

       They sure can, since I don't believe in most of the inane theories posted here, and I attempt to call out the ones who are mostly here just for "ze jews did it!"

       But... nice attempt at deflection. You attempt to do that in literally every single thread about you as well, almost always pretending like "your account is only blahblah old kek" or some such thing like you just tried with me is actually meaningful in some way. Sure seems like something "The smart people" would just laugh at.

      <p>
       Exhibit A
      </p>
      <p>
       Your commentary here is primarily focused on "calling people out" as you put it.  Which translates in reality to being a dick.  This subreddit isn't about agreeing with everything you read or the people posting it.  Its about having the freedom to have a discussion about ANY topic without being bullied by SJWs who use terms like "I'm calling them out for their bad ideas".
      </p>
      <p>
       So its no wonder that you don't like me, this is exactly the kind of behavior that I moderate!
      </p>
      <p>
       In this instance, since the subject was about me being shadow banned and the subject was real and not manufactured by the drama club, I'm not moderating any of it.  So enjoy your free pass to say nasty things about me here, but outside of this post you'll be expected to follow all the rules.

       Yeah, I just said I call people out when I can see poor ideas and poor logic. I have my few pet conspiracy ideas, and I refute the completely bonkers ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub allows me to do that right? I get the same right to state my opinion as everyone else right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I always follow the rules here, that's why I've never been banned on any of my accounts that I've used over the past 5 or 6 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's funny, is that you are implying that you'd have banned me for what I've posted... yet I've not posted any nasty things about you. Everything I've posted is factual. I've broken ZERO rules in this thread. I have not insulted you personally, I have not insulted anyone personally, I've used no slurs, I haven't even accused you of rulebreaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only one you could get me on is "Attacking a mod"... a reaaaaaal stretch!
      </p>
      <p>
       Which seems to me, that's exactly why people don't want you as a mod. You think that anything I've said here is ban worthy? Yet you are pretty much implying you would have banned me and this is a 'free pass'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your ideas on attacking a mod seem to be censorship of being critical toward you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people should have noticed also, that you've deflected back to post history once again as basically your only point. I mean... me personally... i would feel a bit... weak, if that was the only thing I used in almost all instances such as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been extremely courteous to you here, I've not called you any names or done anything that was not respectfully dissentful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, I am told I would be banned, and I am basically called a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kinda like my case is just falling into place.

       This is untrue, and you know it frankly... can't be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use me for an example. I have zero... absolutely zero interest in wanting to punish anyone for having ideas of any sort. I think posting them and being utterly unwilling to hear criticism of said idea is retarded sure (as evidenced by my constant laughter at how calling someone a 'shill' imo means said person is a total idiot who can't back up his claims properly). But posting ideas is absolutely fine, within reason obviously. I mean... I hardly think the community wants the front page filled with titles like "The godamn dirt jewbags did nuther crimes in the world"
      </p>
      <p>
       I've broken zero rules, I've done none of the things you've mentioned in this post about "can't talk about this and that cause of this and that"
      </p>
      <p>
       So... how does that fit into your idea here, where you clearly implied that a 'free pass' was all that was keeping me from being banned?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can understand why your... what amounts to a threat honestly.. doesn't follow your own standard of rules, then you should understand why not everyone who thinks you shouldn't have the power, and can't be throw aside with using your "no true scotsman" argument that "oh those people don't matter cause they aren't in the real group that matters".

       I'm on record quite a few times in this sub in telling people to chill out when dealing with the mods here, because I know that there is no change in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what happens, (yes I mean literally no matter what), there will be no change here. Which in itself says something pretty clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should have taken my own advice and played the game instead of around the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only sad part is that even if you are 100% right, even if 99.9% of all the people who say you shouldn't be mod are trolls and come from
       <a href="/r/conspiritard">
        /r/conspiritard
       </a>
       , The mere fact that your power is untouchable by those you have power over is enough to know that the power shouldn't reside there. I can say that honestly because as we already know you've said "I will not step down as moderator no matter what"

       There is a very big difference between that, and making fun of people with different ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not believe 9/11 was totally an inside job, but I do not make fun of those who believe so. It is a valid idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should be able to see the difference otherwise I'm not going to bother. Being so open minded that you will accept complete nonsense is equally as stupid as being so closed minded that you believe nothing.

       This is exactly the type of open mindedness that I was talking about. There's an obvious limit. Intense closed mindedness is stupidity, no different than intense open mindedness is stupidity.

       We dont actually know if he exists or not. We have lots of content that tells us he doesn't exist, But in a  little kids world he might exist. It doesn't really matter weather its true or not. Being in a dualistic world where the truth is hidden behind what appears to be a false reality one cant really know for sure if anything really exists or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no limits. The only limits are ones created within ourselves in an attempt to overcome the fear of the unknown which is really all about the fear of death. a psychological attempt at making us feel comfortable in a world of absolute mystery. Thats about as far as we have gotten.

       This is one reason my post history looks the way it does. Talking to people like you who think you are somehow ahead of the curve...while all you do is talk incoherently and then equate the fact that most people ignore you, as somehow being too smart or enlightened.
      </p>

       Intent is all you need to make sense of anything, Content tends to distract from the real truth behind the message.
Its like having a lot to say but with the intent of misleading, or not knowing how to say something with the intent of being understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intent is king, because the intent behind message is whats important, not the message itself.
You can spend all kinds of energy focusing on content and become mislead, or you can look at the intent behind what is said and derive meaning from that. I choose to focus on intent because it always leads me to the real truth.

       No.  I'm not a conspiratard or SRD person.  You don't enforce the rules in a consistent manner.  You let people whose only intention it is to disrupt slide by after multiple violations and then ban your own users when they push back against them.

       Selectively choosing what evidence to believe, and what to throw by the wayside does not make you smart or right, it just makes you blind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is such a thing as a valid conspiracy, but most posted here (and reference in your comment) are unfounded, and rather then actually trying to prove such theories,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ignores the evidence that doesnt match their side of the argument and treats these theories as fact.

       Maybe this will change your mind:
       <a href="http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;amp;artid=167">
        "September 11 - The New Pearl Harbour"

       - Perhaps the best documentary on 9/11 so far and goes into great analysis and details from both sides of the arguments.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Most "Holocaust revisionists" don't deny the Holocaust, but think that history regarding the Holocaust was exagerated and has some half-truths in it and whatnot.

      <p>
       There are definitly oligarchs that run the US and else-where, but I would never bet money on them being reptilians. Symbology is often used by the top oligarchs and certain secret societies that certain oligarchs associate with.

       Which I would say that the removal of flytape as a mod, we can have better discussions, especially without drawing attention from the two previously mentioned subs. The guy was emotional, power hungry and even antagonistic, at times. None of which are good qualities fir a mod.
      </p>

       But can we agree to disagree? I hate these deeply threaded standoffs.

       This sub is left for the worse in the absence of his knowledge base of reddit trolls; and he will hopefully be able to return at the conclusion of this situation.

       I'd be careful to jump to conclusions though. I'm pretty sure recently they've been interpreting following the meta bot to where you were linked as brigading or whatever. Which I think is silly tbh.

       I doubt it, we have users back brigading all the time. If that rule was put in place half the moderators on reddit would be shadowbanned. I'd bet a months shill salary it was vote manipulation if he has multiple active accounts.

       Check the citizen prime thread in the drama subreddit. A few users talk about how they've been banned for it. Citizen prime is the user by the way. Titles something about unwritten rules.

       If Flytape straightens this out with the admins there is no reason he cannot moderate again but as it stands now his account is gone.

       Something similar happened with another one of our moderators some months ago, there was a mistake, he got his account back and he was reinstated to the mod team.

       Maybe Flytape shouldn't have acted the way he did, but he got caught up in the drama that was specifically manufactured to discredit and rile up the sub. Does he pay an ultimate price? That's up to the community. But let's not let SRD influence the politic of this sub if possible, please.

       I dunno if you can throw CN into this.. Plenty of bored dudes who love to troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       I (a regular user) typically ignore most meme/top posts because they are obviously gamed/bought and paid for/used as distractions.

      <p>
       This is something that we as a community cannot combat (or at least I cannot figure out a solution).

       However, it looks like these types of shitposts can apparently be

       , and Flytape (regardless of your opinion of his mod style/policies) may have been a casualty.

       You're right. Reddit is NOT owned by Conde Nast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is owned by
       <strong>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications#Subsidiaries">
         Advance Publications
        </a>
       </strong>
       - which ALSO owns Conde Nast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advance Publications is owned by
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Newhouse">
        Donald Newhouse
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Irving_Newhouse,_Jr.">
        S.I. Newhouse, Jr
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So the same two brothers that own Conde Nast own Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the cow doesn't
       <em>

       the pig, rather, both the cow and the pig are owned by the same "farmers".

       Yeah, its not a "Conde Nast Agenda" nor any parent agenda as Reddit operates mostly independently. Also I dont think "HEY ADMINS" works like a bat signal to call them, you might have better luck messaging them if a rule was actually broken. And drop the "SHUT THIS SUB UP" schtick, you sound like a typical tin-foil hatter which is why this sub is a laughing stock on reddit.

       I know. Sometimes a comment like that can stop a post in it's tracks, but that one just kept going.

       Seems obvious that there was a conspiratard brigade of some kind.

       Seems a little fishy to be honest, and very abrupt.  Hopefully flytape offers an explanation at some point.

       I never had much interaction with
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape
       </a>
       , but I certainly had no complaints against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He did stand up for me one time long ago: The notorious
       <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">
        /u/BipolarBear0
       </a>
       had banned me from
       <em>
        every sub he mods
       </em>
       for what he called "racism" (he
       <em>
        pretended
       </em>
       not to understand the idiom "
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_squeaky_wheel_gets_the_grease">
        The squeaky wheel gets the grease
       </a>
       ")... I had never heard of
       <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">
        /u/BipolarBear0
       </a>
       , and had posted in maybe 1 or 2 of the subs he mods... and the post was NOT in one of those subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I made a self-post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       bitching about
       <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">
        /u/BipolarBear0
       </a>
       's heavy-handed and unjustified actions, and the thread went viral - at one point, another mod "disappeared" the thread, and
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape
       </a>
       stepped in to put it back up (THANKS,
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape
       </a>
       !).
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue of the asshat
       <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">
        /u/BipolarBear0
       </a>
       blew up - even attracting attention from news media outside Reddit. Opened up a big can of worms regarding censorship on Reddit. LOL!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the asshat
       <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">
        /u/BipolarBear0
       </a>
       is a DARLING of subs that HATE
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , such as SRD and Tard Island, and while I'm not very familiar with
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape
       </a>
       's activities aside from the occasional times I have seen him in this sub, I know that he is
       <strong>
        HATED
       </strong>
       by the TardyBoys, the Klown Krew at SRD, and a couple of other subs that I decline to mention due to nausea, but that have their stated goal as DESTROYING
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        V for Vendetta
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don't know what caused
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape
       </a>
       's ban, or what he does in other subs, but I
       <strong>
        do
       </strong>
       know that he has long been incessantly HOUNDED by some of the most lying, vicious, vindictive, villainous scum that has ever slithered out of the darkest, dankest cracks in the floor of Reddit's sub-basement - so he must have been doing SOMETHING right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, is it just my dementia, or are many of those "celebrating"
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape
       </a>
       's demise in this thread total strangers to this sub?

       I think this stinks just a bit... I'm fairly new here and I've talked with Flytape before and he seemed like a genuine guy. He was trying to standup and help out someone with severe mental issues that the conspiratards had been harassing, I think they were trying to push him to do something crazy so they could have some lolz.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all get pissed off and say stupid shit. I'm a bit saddened by this.

       <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">
        /u/JamesColesPardon

       would probably make a very good mod! Or if Flytape returns they could both be mods :)

       Ok.

      <p>
       Well maybe you'll understand this more clearly then.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the only people bitching about me are the ones who want free reign to socially punish people for having ideas that are "bad".

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is untrue, and you know it frankly... can't be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use me for an example. I have zero... absolutely zero interest in wanting to punish anyone for having ideas of any sort. I think posting them and being utterly unwilling to hear criticism of said idea is retarded sure (as evidenced by my constant laughter at how calling someone a 'shill' imo means said person is a total idiot who can't back up his claims properly). But posting ideas is absolutely fine, within reason obviously. I mean... I hardly think the community wants the front page filled with titles like "The godamn dirt jewbags did nuther crimes in the world"
      </p>
      <p>
       I've broken zero rules, I've done none of the things you've mentioned in this post about "can't talk about this and that cause of this and that"
      </p>
      <p>
       So... how does that fit into your idea here, where you clearly implied that a 'free pass' was all that was keeping me from being banned?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can understand why your... what amounts to a threat honestly.. doesn't follow your own standard of rules, then you should understand why not everyone who thinks you shouldn't have the power, and can't be throw aside with using your "no true scotsman" argument that "oh those people don't matter cause they aren't in the real group that matters".

       No.  I'm not a conspiratard or SRD person.  You don't enforce the rules in a consistent manner.  You let people whose only intention it is to disrupt slide by after multiple violations and then ban your own users when they push back against them.
      </p>

       That and the fact you act like a condescending jerk and don't do your due diligence doesn't help.

       Selectively choosing what evidence to believe, and what to throw by the wayside does not make you smart or right, it just makes you blind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is such a thing as a valid conspiracy, but most posted here (and reference in your comment) are unfounded, and rather then actually trying to prove such theories,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       ignores the evidence that doesnt match their side of the argument and treats these theories as fact.
