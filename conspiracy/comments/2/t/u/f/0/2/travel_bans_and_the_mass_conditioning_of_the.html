       Travel bans were issued for much of the Metropolitan area last night, with the curfew being 11 pm Monday night before finally being lifted Tuesday morning.  Major snowstorm expected to hit, so no big deal.  Right?  After all, first responders would theoretically be risking their lives to aid anyone needing help.  No stores would be open.  I could go on and on listing rational reasons to not travel.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's look at the other effects that banning free travel has on mass segments of the population:  To start, the travel ban was enacted ahead of the storm (that ended up not being too bad, but that fact is irrelevant right now with the point I am making).  So what that tells the Public is that the Government thinks something is going to happen, and they are going to take some of your freedom from you in order to make you "safe."  And they have the media illustrate the worst case scenario and plaster it everywhere in order to justify usurping the law and restricting free travel.  People are scared, but they believe that the Government is looking out for them.  So they are happy to allow the Government to tell them that they can't leave their homes.  They also obediently await to hear someone of authority to tell them when it's ok to emerge.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been happening more frequently lately, and what it is psychologically doing to the collective Public is conditioning them to be accepting and apathetic to the Government telling them that they have no freedom should they decide not to give it to you.  People should never be told that traveling in our country is illegal.  If the Government issued travel
       <em>
        warnings
       </em>
       or travel
       <em>
        advisories
       </em>
       , fine.  But all of a sudden it's
       <strong>
        illegal
       </strong>
       and there is a
       <strong>
        ban
       </strong>
       on travel.  Now we have to put up with losing freedoms due to the weather, just like we had to put up with losing freedoms due to "terrorism."
      </p>
      <p>
       But why should people be out in a snowstorm anyway?  No stores are open.  No reason to be out driving.  Right?  But if that is the case, that line of suspicion could be applied to any other night, after a certain time.  Out after midnight?  Well, why then?  Not many stores are open...Must be up to something!  With these seemingly routine "travel bans"- people are being conditioned to support the word of the Government, leading to large percentages of the population being okay with instances like cops targeting people driving late at night, pulling them over just "to see what they're up to."  Cop finds nothing?  No harm, no foul- no one ever hears about it again except the small circle of friends of the poor kid that got harassed for no reason.  Cop finds a little pot, or whatever?  Now the cop is justified, gets to arrest the "scumbag," and the public is behind the hero getting one more "criminal" off the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Travel bans are not merely limited to inclement weather.  We see travel bans popping up more frequently whenever is convenient.  Large areas are now routinely cordoned off when the police are on a "manhunt."  People must stay in their homes.  If you are out driving- car is stopped, car is searched.  People are fine with it, no questions asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there is a lot more going on to aide in conditioning the American Public.  But this subject is a slippery slope, one that goes overlooked by some people, and issues and awareness need to be raised regarding the wording and promotion of these Government-issued restrictions.  They are unlawful, intrusive, and controlling, not to mention unnecessary.

       I thought you guys had a guarantee to travel freely in your constitution? Not that that means much anymore these days. Seems like another case of giving up freedom for the illusion of security.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also heard that the ban stayed on until late into the morning despite the fact that the weather turned out to be not that bad. I wonder if anyone would actually get in trouble in this situation?

       The Constitution hardly matters anymore.  Everything is justified because of "public safety" and "terrorism" and nobody cares that it flies in the face of a truly free people.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, there is an amendment that says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  It doesn't say it can be infringed a little bit.  It doesn't say it can be infringed when times are dangerous or scary.  And yet we have tens of thousands of gun control laws on state and federal law books.   The important words of the Constitution stopped meaning anything a long time ago when busybody politicians had to keep making laws to be seen as doing useful things.

       You do have a right to travel freely....see Arizona and border checkpoints. Or the tsa checkpoints in weigh stations and truck stops thru the Midwest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah tsa I typed that out right. They give you some pamphlet on safety and shake your hand like some pr stunt. They cant legally detain you its why so many you see are fighting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is with this kind of weather they are somewhat right in restricting travel. The fine is bullshit. Oklahoma did it different they said "we wont come save you. If you are out and get stranded oh well"

      <p>
       That's what makes more sense to me. The government is supposed to be here to help us, not be our parents and control us. If they decide that the risk of helping someone is too great due to weather or that the risk of travelling is too great then they let us know that we're on our own and that's that.

       You got it all wrong. The bans were plead by the thru ways and dot of each state. The reason is these fucking residents of each state dont care about road closures and will lift the gates you see on the highways because they think meh whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well the problem is that the dumbasses get stranded and abandon the car. Well in morning when the plows come to clear the roads there are cars all over. Its a simple thing of needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sourse I do inspections on the thruway and dot vehicles for ny, jersey, and ct.

       Its just a good thing shit wasnt as bad as it could have been. And now everyone wants to blame someone for some shit.

       Still seems odd to me to punish people monetarily or by locking them up for traveling during a ban. Makes more sense to me to just tell people that they're on their own if they choose to go out. Do we realy need the government punishing people?

       Your car wasn't likely going to get you very far last night anyway - you were free to walk through the blizzard if you want.

       Crazy as it is, NYC is much more of a walking town anyway. I guess you could've only looked at the thousands of photos of people enjoying the car-free streets before you actually bothered to take him at his word that "any form of travel was banned"

       While I see OPs point of view I can honestly say it was like 100 times easier trying to do my job and clear the streets when no one was out on the roads as opposed to 2010 when there were cars littered everywhere because people were getting stuck and just walking away.  Which caused us not to be able to do our job and in turn people died because ambulances and such couldnt get to where they needed to.  Yes the storm wasn't as bad,  but if you saw New England that could of easily been NYC.

       I doubt that foot traffic was a psrt of that ban. By "travel", i believe they meant public transportation like busses, subways, and airplanes, as well as vehicles using the
       <em>
        government owned
       </em>
       roads.  I doubt that walking anywhere by foot wouldve been banned or restricted. There is a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, as someone who works in the field that clears these roads, i can tell you that the dumbasses who get in their cars and drive during snowstorms are more dangerous than the actual westher. It becomes less of an issue about freedom to
       <em>
        drive
       </em>
       than it is for the protection of other citizens who are cleaning shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, i get your point about this being a slippery slope. But in this case, when weather is a factor, i support it. But, when its about "terrorists" or like what happened in Boston? Now that becomes a constitutional issue. Travel bans are much different, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, if we are going to be sticklers about our freedoms, lets focus on the more important topics like the second amendment, or events/decisions that actually affect the fourth amendment. Thats how i feel, anyhow..
      </p>
      <p>
       I do get your skepticism, though. But in this case im not behind it.

       Just to clarify, I am in no way condoning travel during a serious snowstorm.  In fact, I would be supportive if the Government merely suggested to not travel, such as the case in the past when you would see them issue "Travel
       <strong>
        Advisories"
       </strong>
       .  What I am raising issue with is the terminology they now use (Travel
       <strong>
        Bans
       </strong>
       ) and how dictating instructions in that manner affects people's thinking.  Now all of a sudden it becomes
       <strong>
        law
       </strong>
       instead of a suggestion.  Of course you have to be an idiot to travel in a blizzard.  But now you can be fined and arrested if you leave your house, says the Government.  Why do they need to hold our hands?  Why are they able to usurp what is legal under the guise of saving people from themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone else in this thread jokingly mentioned the "seatbelt law."  Although I think he was attempting to be funny and make light of my post, but examples like "travel bans" are actually direct descendants of laws like "the seatbelt law."
      </p>
      <p>
       And I did acknowledge that this issue is just one of many in the greater scheme to brainwash the public.  But it helps to remind people when instances arise, and make them aware of how the assault on their freedoms is progressing.

      <p>
       Thats the part i am contesting, not the use of terminology. Id like to see the actual text of the order myself, so that i can discern exactly what was meant, but i highly doubt it meant that one could not leave their dwelling. Its much more likely that it was strictly for transportation purposes, i.e. the driving of ones vehicle on city roads. But again, the argument should remsin stale until this text is found and posted on this thread (when i have time later ill try and find it if nobody else has by then).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, if they meant that it would not be legal for one to leave their house on foot, id be on board with your concerns. But, if the only thing banned was vehicular travel on public roads, well, i wont support yout concerns, tbh.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the latter scenario, it would be an argument of whether driving is a constitutionally protected right, which it is not. Thus, banning travel via such means would be reasonable and legal. But, in the former scenario, it would be a much more complicated argument, basically a quarentine, of which the government would not have authority to enact.
      </p>
      <p>
       A similar melody is sung about the seatbelt laws. Is it illegal to drive with no seat belt? Depends. If you are on private property, by all means, do what you want with your own vehicle. But if you are going to be using government owned property (roads, etc.) then we must abide by their laws. Just like speed limits.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all comes down to what is and what isnt vetted by the constitution. Our right to drive a vehicle is not protected (when used on government property), but is protected when on private property. The authority to force one in their dwellings is not grsnted by the constitution to the government, so long as one is not court ordered (e.g. a felon on house arrest). Thats the difference. And until we see the text, the argument for or against your post is all speculative and based on ignorance.

       <strong>
        AGAIN
       </strong>
       , my problem is with the terminology used and the effects it has on the minds of the average person.  It's not a travel
       <strong>
        warning
       </strong>
       or
       <strong>
        advisory
       </strong>
       anymore, it's a
       <strong>
        ban
       </strong>
       and a
       <strong>
        restriction
       </strong>
       .  Just like "Buckle up
       <strong>
        for safety
       </strong>
       " all of a sudden became "Buckle up, it's
       <strong>
        the law
       </strong>
       ".  Just like "Friends don't let friends drink and drive"  became "Drive sober or get pulled over."  It's just the constant attack on and the conditioning of the average American's mind.  What don't you seem to understand about my point?  Every comment you make in this thread is deliberately overlooking the point I am constantly spelling out for you.

       It seemed to me like you were more concerned with the fact that folks couldnt "leave their house." This was at the foundation of your post, after all (with a strong focus on new yorks recent travel ban). Thats why i was focusing on that aspect, as i dont believe people were confined to their homes like they were during the boston marsthon bombing. These are two seperate things in a very fundamental way.
      </p>
      <p>
       But alas, you made yourself clear. Its possible i have misgauged your premise, and for thst ill apologize.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, I dont follow your conclusions as you have presented them, but i do believe a war on words has long been waged on the People. Nonetheless, this became a less interesting thread for me. Ill see ya around, Doc.

       Pedestrian travel was banned in NYC and another claim in MA that a summons would be issued for a predetermined $500 fine. All off the MSM. I agree many people should know enough to stay home, they should "strongly advise" as has always been the case. Northern New Englanders find traveling in snow to be rather second nature, on the other hand the cross Bronx is no place to be in this stuff, alas common sense is in short supply.

       It just highlights it's unneccessary quality, to go beyond a travel advisory, to an outright BAN or travel "curfew".

       All they were doing was staying prepared in case we got hit with a projected 3 feet. If that happened, the city would be a total mess, so the roads would have to be shut down. It's too late to shut them down though once the snow has already fallen which is why they had to do it before.

       Edit: The snowstorm went around NYC, so it turns out that the travel BAN or what they've also referred to as a travel "curfew", wasn't really neccessary, except to control the masses.

       It's more about access for plows, than feared accidents. A parking + travel ban, issued hours before the snow even started falling, allowed for sanding before and intensive plowing throughout today's blizzard. Call me a buzzkill, but I'm happy I will be able to get out &amp; about more easily tomorrow and sat on my ass today!

        But why should people be out in a snowstorm anyway? No stores are open. No reason to be out driving. Right? But if that is the case, that line of suspicion could be applied to any other night, after a certain time. Out after midnight? Well, why then? Not many stores are open...Must be up to something!

       This doesn't work. You shouldn't travel during a snow storm because it's a snow storm. Not because there's no reason to be driving, you shouldn't drive because it's not safe. People are dumb and might cause damage to other people or themselves because they thought they could drive safely during a snow storm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you compare it to being out after midnight on any other night. But there's no direct dangers of going out after midnight. So I don't think you can compare the two like that. I get what your saying but I think it's quite a stretch.

       That's great - I'm sure you recognize that there isn't a single goddamn fucking part of canada that is as remotely dense as NYC. So maybe you can see why in the part of Canada where you live in, where it regularly snows that amount, they wouldn't ban cars from the roads (I imagine most people must drive snow-friendly cars because of that), but in NYC that's not the case. Because in NYC it rarely, if ever, snows as much as it was supposed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And guess what - as soon as the morning hit and the storm passed without as much trouble as expected - the roads were free for everyone to use!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you have your perspective, but you should have the decency and common sense to respect people living in an incredibly different and urban lifestyle. In NYC if the roads are open, they'd be full of jackasses driving around, crashing, and making an even bigger mess for the STATE (who else do you think is going to drive the ambulance, and tow the car, and then fix whatever streetlight you crashed into?) to clean up.
      </p>
      <p>
       They banned travel during what was supposed to be the worst part of the worst snow storm ever. It didn't happen and they lifted it. What's exactly the drama? This isn't Canada - can you recognize the differences??

       It's that same attitude that gets people stranded in snow drifts. Then plows can't do their jobs and emergency vehicles have to respond. People have trouble driving in just rain, never mind several feet of snow.

       You walk to somewhere where you can warm up because you prepared and took sufficient clothing and materials to get you somewhere in the event your car was stranded. Being responsible for yourself is fun.

       Every single thing he posts is to refute claims made by people here and to back up the official story.

       Just to clarify, I am in no way condoning travel during a serious snowstorm.  In fact, I would be supportive if the Government merely suggested to not travel, such as the case in the past when you would see them issue "Travel
       <strong>
        Advisories"
       </strong>
       .  What I am raising issue with is the terminology they now use (Travel
       <strong>
        Bans
       </strong>
       ) and how dictating instructions in that manner affects people's thinking.  Now all of a sudden it becomes
       <strong>
        law
       </strong>
       instead of a suggestion.  Of course you have to be an idiot to travel in a blizzard.  But now you can be fined and arrested if you leave your house, says the Government.  Why do they need to hold our hands?  Why are they able to usurp what is legal under the guise of saving people from themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone else in this thread jokingly mentioned the "seatbelt law."  Although I think he was attempting to be funny and make light of my post, but examples like "travel bans" are actually direct descendants of laws like "the seatbelt law."
      </p>
      <p>
       And I did acknowledge that this issue is just one of many in the greater scheme to brainwash the public.  But it helps to remind people when instances arise, and make them aware of how the assault on their freedoms is progressing.

       Pedestrian travel was banned in NYC and another claim in MA that a summons would be issued for a predetermined $500 fine. All off the MSM. I agree many people should know enough to stay home, they should "strongly advise" as has always been the case. Northern New Englanders find traveling in snow to be rather second nature, on the other hand the cross Bronx is no place to be in this stuff, alas common sense is in short supply.
