       Thanks for your concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I didn't know too much.  I went to SRD because I get a shot ton of username mentions from that sub, so I used an alt account to "defend myself" and laugh at the circle jerk.  I had to use an alt because I'm banned from that sub, and using an alt to evade a subreddit ban is apparently grounds for a shadow ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not know this, but now I do.  I have been unbanned and everything is right with the world.

       I can assure you that he does. You can attack a group of people, like saying all black people are dumb, But you can't attack a single person, like a single racist, by calling them a racist (even if they admit they are one), because that's personal and only a meanie would do that :(.

       Its possible to do that without making it personal but that requires one to have extraordinary tact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you're 100% confident that your comment isn't just a fancy worded personal attack I would recommend that you just stick to the subject at hand and forget about the user.

       If a racist didn't want to be called a racist they should not have said something racist. If they are confident that what they said is not racist they should be able to defend themselves and convey that.

      <p>
       Why do you feel it is important to protect the feelings of those who hold abhorrent, hateful opinions while turning a blind eye in situations in which other rules are broken? the rule against shill accusations being a prime example.

       We definitely act on shill accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as racism goes.  Reality is racist sometimes.  Thus we must be able to discuss it.  We can not ignore the elephant in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy exists to discuss these unpopular ideas.  So we do not appreciate social punishment for people doing exactly what they are supposed to do here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we draw a line on what is too offensive to discuss here then we may as well draw 12 of them.  If we allow users to be attacked for racism then we must define racism, which causes us to draw more lines, and then someone is also offended about dead children being discussed and they want to attack people for that too. Then its feminism and MRAs and then we can't talk about this or that or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the SJWs control the conversation, not the actual community.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we draw no lines except on how you are expected to behave here.  We moderate behavior and not content.

       I have never once seen someone be warned or banned for a shill accusation. And they occur in nearly every thread in which a user posts a dissenting opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you go on a diatribe about free speech regarding the use of words or language while defending the right to ban those who make statements you don't like, such as racism accusations?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not see the contradiction?
      </p>

       Edit: Your attempt to differentiate behaviour and content is a bullshit excuse. You selectively ban that which you don't like.

       The reason you don't hear about it because the people accusing others of being shills don't report back to SRD or some other metareddit to complain about it.  You're only hearing one half of the story.

       No. I am going into threads and seeing comments with users straight out calling other people shills as a means of discrediting them. I am on a phone so linking is difficult, but it is likely unnecessary considering I have a feeling you know how prevalent it is.
      </p>

       Then there are all the times people are called sheep, government apologists, useful idiots etc. Never enforced.

       You seem to be dodging some of my questions so I'll cut to the chase. Why do you think it is appropriate to selectively limit free speech according to your own biases?

       We are outnumbered here on reddit.  If we were to allow this place to be absolutely no holds barred, it would not be a conspiracy sub it would look more like conspiratard.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub if FOR talking about conspiracies, its NOT FOR harassing people who want to talk about conspiracies.  So do we enforce the rules in favor of people who show a genuine interest in conspiracy theories?  Absolutely we do.  Do we outright ignore rules violations by people who show genuine interest in conspiracy theories? No we don't.  Our bias leans in the favor of people who show genuine interest in conspiracy theories, as it should.  Anyone who wants it to be a different way has their own reasons for being here and has no genuine interest in conspiracy theories.

       We aren't required to let people come here and shit on this community for the sake of fairness.

       My question was:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Why do you think it is appropriate to selectively limit free speech according to your own biases?"
      </p>
      <p>
       You've actually answered it quite well. Your explanation perfectly demonstrates the method you use silence those you disagree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       By selectively enforcing the rules based on your own definitions of "genuine interest" you essentially give yourself Carte-Blanche to ban anyone who disagrees with you. See, on my other account, I would likely fall under someone you would label as an individual who shits on this subreddit. In reality, I have a very keen interest in conspiracy theories, I just happen not to believe in many of them. So I debate people here and question motives and conclusions. Using loosely defined rules and language allows you to do whatever you want. As a result, genuine skeptics are scared away or banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are exactly what this sub-reddit claims to hate, but on a smaller scale. An individual who exercises control in their position of power to enforce a specific worldview. Someone who uses the rules and system to their own ends while labelling any who might oppose as a dissenter sent from a rival faction to disrupt the peace.

       Sounds like you just twisted what he said. 
The gist of it is:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        If you dont want to have a healthy debate about the facts or lack of of a conspiracy you dont belong here.
       </li>
       <li>
        If you want to attack a persons character by using inflammatory statements like "You're Crazy" or " "Delusional" instead of focusing on the facts or lack their of - You dont belong here.
       </li>
      </ol>

       This isn't Flytypes personal vendetta against anyone, this is what a mod is suppose to do in this community, keep discussions on track, if you dont like it, you don't have to be here. The fact that you are here and dont agree with this is very suggestive as to your motives.

       That is true. The problem is that there is a blatant double standard. Shill accusations, claims of people being sheep are never, ever enforced. In fact, Flytape often takes part in those himself. But the second you dare imply something someone said is racist... here comes the banhammer. So...

       It absolutely is. It is selective enforcement of the rules to fit an agenda. You are following what you should be here to fight.

       No they banned
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape
       </a>
       years ago for telling the truth about SRD circlejerking in SRD. I used a different account
       <a href="/u/fiytape">
        /u/fiytape
       </a>
       to defend myself in there.  By using a different account to evade a ban, I brought this shadow ban on myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The admins unbanned me because it was pretty obvious that I was summoned there by username mention like 20 times.  The mods of SRD likely reported me for ban evasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've agreed to not comment in SRD from any account in the future.

       And if ban evasion is truly a shadowbannable offense, admins have a

         lot

       Had lost all interest over a year ago because of the rules and the blatant racism. Hebdo happened and I returned, but reddit in general and this sub are clearly not what they used to be.

       Thanks man,

       I was snagged on a rule that didn't exist 6 days ago and I had no idea it existed.

       Using an alt to comment in a sub you've been banned from (in my case SRD) will now get your accounts banned from reddit by the admins.  Rest assured that conspiracy will benefit from this new reddit law more than most.

       Yeah I think I'm caught up in the Flytape Drama™ for now. The rule is interesting though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any way for mods to know that stuff though? I would think it would have to be via IP addresses or something (for the alts) and feel that kind of information would be admin-level, not mod-level. But I am probably mistaken.

       For what it is worth (considering you know nothing of me), I think the fact you rile up
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">

       and
