<hr/>

<p>Let&#39;s assume this is done at Birkenau, in 4 morgues (&quot;gas chambers&quot;) x 2000 each = 8000 per batch for 10 batches. We&#39;ll ignore the problems with gassing and body removal, and just focus on the body disposal:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Raul Hilberg says the 46 crematory retorts at Birkenau could process 4400 bodies/day total, which is an average of 15min/body if they are running 24/7 (in reality you&#39;d need at least 60-90min/body + cool-down time between cremations.)</p></li>
<li><p>cremation: 8000 bodies in 46 retorts = 174 rounds of cremations (per batch of 8000)</p></li>
<li><p>174 rounds of cremations x 15min each = 43.5hrs (per batch of 8000)</p></li>
<li><p>10 batches = 435 hours = 18 days.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One major problem: there&#39;d be no room to store the bodies in the crematory while they were working through cremating each batch, and hurrying the next group in.</p>

<p>80,000 overnight is an absurdity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a pretty good article about an entirely different point of view that painted the Jews in in the camps much differently. Essentially there were self governing hierarchies that would distribute food and clothes within the camp. This is where the corruption was said to have begun and those on top would take and hoard things like food which created a malnourishment problem. The article went on to say they mostly died from this and disease, not gas chambers. The speculated number was also around 400k, which is not the first time I&#39;d heard a number lower than one million in a story that actually made some sense. </p>

<p>Make sure to downvote this low enough so I can&#39;t grab your ankles and bring you down with me.</p>

<p>Yes. The bodies we&#39;ve seen footage of are from several camps in the west which became overcrowded after prisoners were evacuated from camps in the east, as the Soviets were advancing. (They actually gave them the choice of staying and waiting for the Soviets, or retreating with the Germans -- see Wiesel. Most chose to go with the Germans, despite this story that they were being systematically exterminated.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the US and UK were bombing the shit out of Germany. Rail lines were cut, roads destroyed. The entire state was collapsing. Because of this, food and medicine (etc) couldn&#39;t get through to these camps which were suddenly overcrowded way past their design capacity. Disease outbreaks occured, and were much worse than those outbreaks earlier in the 40&#39;s.</p>

<p>US Army doctors actually confirmed this at the time -- that those dead bodies were the result of disease. But for the propaganda films they left this crucial information out, and tried to give people the impression they had been &quot;exterminated&quot; by the Evil Germans.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no &quot;despite&quot; here. That&#39;s basic human psychology. Choosing to take the unknown against the stable (even if the stable involves beatings and killings) is a consistent, known behaviour. That&#39;s how people act. Them choosing to &quot;stay with the germans&quot; isn&#39;t indicative of anything.</p>

<p>Oh. Shocked really. The hundreds of thousands of people who were forcefully removed from their homes and families under constant threat of violence, spent the last 10 years being treated as Non-Persons by the state and then stuck in camps to be worked to death or murdered outright were now suffering.

<p>No, human psychology is to separate yourself from people who are brutally torturing and mass-murdering your kind. To argue anything else is absurd -- but that&#39;s why you&#39;re here. Keep trying.</p>

<p>Lol. Jews weren&#39;t systematically rounded up and put into camps in 1935, friend. Jews in German controlled Europe were placed in camps, during wartime, starting in 1941 (I think), for the same reason Japanese were put in camps in the US. Please at least read Hilberg.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s pretty basic human psychology. Choose the known over the unknown. The familiar versus the not. That&#39;s why kidnapped humans sometimes go so far as to buy and return to live in the same house they. were held captive and abused in for years.</p>

<p>Thats what i said.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Right so the hundreds of thousands of people who were forcefully removed from their homes and families under constant threat of violence, spent the last 10 years being treated as Non-Persons by the state and then stuck incamps to be worked to death or murdered is totally okay because <em>others did it too</em>.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s even making the ludicrous claim that the internment camps of japanese-americans and the concentration camps in europe were really at all similar. Which they weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>Perhaps you&#39;ve watched too many movies. For example, you know that footage of stars being drawn on Jewish shop windows -- that happened for precisely one day, as a symbolic counter-protest against the Jewish Congress declaration of economic war. It was even held on a Saturday so it wouldn&#39;t impact Jewish business too much. Allied propagandists (pre-war and post-war) always leave that part out.</p>

<p>And at this point they had already been the target of systematic violence and a week later be removed from numerous jobs including the civil service sector. They had been facing these threats since February of 1920. </p>

<p><em>Der sturmer</em>, first published in 1923 (and other papers showing up around the same time) espoused racial violence.  That year the hauptsynagoge was attacked and several people beaten and had seen several attempts at jewish deportations. Wissmann (1981) shows the murder of jewish shopkeepers in 1923 and 1924 in  Staat und Synagoge 1918–1938: Eine Geschichte des Preussischen Landesverbandes juedischer Gemeinden. Synagogues were attacked in 1927 and 1928. And there&#39;s the Van Helldorf-lead pogroms in Berlin in 1930.   1931 saw direct attacks on jews in september. Between 22 and 33 there were some ~200 incidences of vandalism and desecreation of jewish graves.</p>

<p>And of course, you could just ignore the non-nazi, violent anti-semitism that followed the end of WW1 and Weimar period.</p>

<p>It was published by julius streicher, a nazi. Hitler himself went on to <em>own</em> another similar magazine.</p>

<p>An &quot;official&quot; policy as in &quot;Beat up Jews&quot; in big bold letter doesn&#39;t mean much when it had been a de facto platform of the party since its inception.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Right and so what you can infer from this is that &quot;powerful well connected people tend to do bad things&quot;.  Jew, Russian, German alike. </p>

<p>Instead of focusing on policies of reducing the effect of &quot;powerful people doing bad things&quot; the nazis simply instituted a specific policiy of Powerful People Doing Bad Things. The aim was never to &quot;reduce corruption and racism&quot; but only to &quot;make me more powerful&quot;. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s entirely relevant, as we&#39;re talking about anti-semitism in Germany. It&#39;s not just about &quot;perception&quot; either, but about the actual behavior of Jews and their involvement in activities which (rightly or wrongly) caused others to dislike them.</p>

<p>And please don&#39;t whitewash the Bolshevik crimes in Russia and the Ukraine, and the dominant Jewish role in the Soviet Comintern tentacles throughout Europe -- nor the threat of a genocidal Bolshevik revolution in Germany.</p>

<p>Not really, in a country of 70 million. Most of them were there for criminal offenses. None were there in 1939 &quot;because they are Jewish&quot; as you tried to say.</p>

<p>Hitler <em>promoted</em> streicher to Gauleiter. Feels like an endorsement to me.

    <div class="md"><p>This is precisely what my grandpop told me. He was interred in Auschwitz and (I believe) Bergen Belsen and suffered many beatings by the hands of Jewish &#39;block commandants.&#39; He confirmed that there were no gas chambers in place; just mobile &#39;gas chambers&#39; that killed small groups of people using carbon monoxide. The rumors in camp that gas chambers existed were very strong though. He said they didn&#39;t know, for sure, if the Germans had them at the time but the block commandants used them as a scare tactic...so I feel that people who were there can be forgiven for believing that such facilities existed. He never saw hundreds of people disappear at a time, though he DID tell me about single days where a hundred or more people would be lost from typhus due to the horrible conditions. Also lots of reprisal shootings by shitty Nazi human beings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a damned shame that I cared so little about this subject while he was still alive; could have learned a lot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just hit on the key piece of evidence.</p>

<p>Bullets and ditches are fast and cheap. If killing people for &#39;ethnic cleansing&#39; purposes that would be the way to go. Do you know how many technical challenges are presented by mass gassings? The Germans had a hard enough time not killing themselves with the properly-designed delousing chambers.</p>

<p>People need to remember that the Jews (and other camp prisoners) were a basically free source of skilled and unskilled labor alike for the Germans...whose (nearly) entire male population was serving in a two-front war. If they were killed off the Germans would have lasted MAYBE two years in an active war...and probably not even that. In the ultimate of ironic circumstances...the Jews kept Germany running. There simply were not enough hands to build the German machines of war without reverting to cruel slave labor practices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>C/pasted from the site &quot;Regarding the gassing vans, precursors to the gas chambers, we find, for example, a top secret document from SS Untersturmführer Becker to SS Obersturmbannführer Rauff (from Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, 1946, Vol. I, pp. 999-1001):</p>

<p>If it has rained for instance for only one half hour, the van cannot be used because it simply skids away. It can only be used in absolutely dry weather. It is only a question now whether the van can only be used standing at the place of execution. First the van has to be brought to that place, which is possible only in good weather. ...</p>

<p>The application of gas usually is not undertaken correctly. In order to come to an end as fast as possible, the driver presses the accelerator to the fullest extent. By doing that the persons to be executed suffer death from suffocation and not death by dozing off as was planned. My directions now have proved that by correct adjustment of the levers death comes faster and the prisoners fall asleep peacefully.&quot; </p>

<p>So it&#39;s about Einsatzgruppen. </p>

<p>&quot;A memo from the Auschwitz construction office, dated March 31, 1943, says Hilberg, Documents of Destruction, 1971, pp. 207-208):</p>

<p>We take this occasion to refer to another order of March 6, 1943, for the delivery of a gas door 100/192 for Leichenkeller 1 of Krema III, Bw 30a, which is to be built in the manner and according to the same measure as the cellar door of the opposite Krema II, with peep hole of double 8 millimeter glass encased in rubber. This order is to be viewed as especially urgent....&quot;</p>

<p>This one is for a Lager. 
With proofs that it was meant for gas chamber and not a morgue. </p>

<p>&quot;The question of whether it can be proved that the cyanide gas was used in the Auschwitz gas chambers has intruiged the deniers. Their much-heralded Leuchter Report, for example, expends a great deal of effort on the question of whether traces of cyanide residue remain there today. But we do not need to look for chemical traces to confirm cyanide use (Gutman, op. cit., p. 229):</p>

<p>Letters and telegrams exchanged on February 11 and 12 [1943] between the Zentralbauleitung and Topf mention a wooden blower for Leichenkeller 1. This reference confirms the use of the morgue as a gas chamber: Bischoff and Prüfer thought that the extraction of air mixed with concentrated prussic acid [cyanide] (20 g per cu m) required a noncorroding ventilator.&quot;</p>

<p>the cyanide is useless in morgue since it doesn&#39;t kill bacteria.</p>

<p>Regarding the gassing vans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For which there is precisely zero proof, see:</p>

<p><a href="http://codoh.com/library/categories/975/">http://codoh.com/library/categories/975/</a></p>

<p>They even had to use footage from a 1947 Polish feature film in a supposed documentary about the &quot;gas vans&quot;! (see: <a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/3276/">http://codoh.com/library/document/3276/</a>)</p>

<p>Regarding Bischoff and the &quot;wooden blower&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To reduce the production of smoke, it was believed in the 1940s that
a better draft of the chimney (hence the inclusion of devices to increase
the draft) and a higher combustion air feed (hence the installation of
blowers for the muffles) were needed.</p>

<p>The importance of the presence of these blowers is borne out by a Topf letter dated June 6, 1942, in which the company asked the Auschwitz ZBL to ship to Buchenwald “a blower with motor,” otherwise it would not have been possible to start up the triple-muffle crematorium oven which had just been built.</p>

<p>As I have explained above, Bischoff’s request for 10 gas flue analyzers (Gasprüfer) for the crematoria ovens fits precisely into this context. The meaning of Swoboda’s words, therefore, is that, even though the essential equipment for the cremations could be used only in a limited way, it was still possible to achieve an irreproachable incineration from the hygieno-sanitary point of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not merely a matter of misinterpretation, but also of falsified documents. You understand with all of these Nuremberg-era documents, the originals are never presented, but a typed &quot;copy&quot; of them. The problem is, that when people go to try and find the originals, they often don&#39;t actually exist. We need to be extremely cautious with any of the early documentary evidence, due to systematic evidence falsification in the immediate post-war period,</p>

<p><a href="http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2011/05/jews-initially-claimed-that-2000000.html">Mauthausen was supposed to have been 2m</a> (&quot;mostly Jews&quot;), and now it&#39;s 95k (14k Jews).</p>

<p><a href="http://oi61.tinypic.com/25sbwg1.jpg">Majdanek was originally 1.7m</a> and now is 80k.</p>

<p>There are at least 10 camps (all in the west) where witnesses and confessors lied about gassings, which have now been discarded from the mainstream historical narrative due to investigation in the decades after WWII. [And there are other crazy stories from the western camps: human soap, lampshades, shrunken heads -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVZ_5yWmBRk">US psych-warfare units had a field day with planted evidence.</a>]</p>

<p>The 6 remaining &quot;extermination&quot; camps we have today were all in the Soviet zone, and they refused to let outsiders inspect them.</p>

<p>At the Nuremberg IMT, all that was required to prove that 4m had been gassed at Auschwitz was a Soviet affadavit, signed by two of the men who falsely claimed that the Germans were responsible for the Katyn massacre in Poland (now acknowledged as a Soviet war crime.) No forensic studies of the crime scenes or murder weapons were required or undertaken by these courts.</p>

<p>Crematory manager Ivan Lagacé testified at the 1988 Zundel trial. (Before you just call him a liar, note that he has not been charged with perjury):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The time to cremate a human being (the cremation cycle) took an average of two hours. After the first cremation of the day was completed, the operator must let the retort cool-down for a minimum of one hour before beginning the second case. After the second cremation, a cool- down period of at least two hours was required. Even with cool-down times, Lagacé testified that cremations could not be done &quot;24 hours a day, round the clock, day after day...the refractory will not tolerate it.&quot; Factory recommendation for normal operation was a maximum of three cases per day in a normal eight hour work day. No more than 50 -- 60 cases should be processed in any month so that the refractory life was prolonged. That was an average of 2 cases a day.  (27-7412 to 7415; 7427, 7428)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, TTrns, the crematoria could not keep up with the bodies. That&#39;s why the <a href="http://www.bergenbelsen.co.uk/pages/Trial/Trial/TrialProsecutionCase/Trial_022_Bendel.html">very same testimony</a> describes what extra steps were necessary:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Would you describe just what happened that day?</strong> - I came at seven o&#39;clock in the morning with the others and saw white smoke still rising from the trenches, which indicated that a whole transport had been liquidated or finished off during the night. In Crematorium No. 4 the result which was achieved by burning was apparently not sufficient. The work was not going on quickly enough, so behind the crematorium they dug three large trenches 12 metres long and 6 metres wide. After a bit it was found that the results achieved even in these three big trenches were not quick enough, so in the middle of these big trenches they built two canals through which the human fat or grease should seep so that work could be continued in a quicker way. The capacity of these trenches was almost fantastic. Crematorium No. 4 was able to burn 1000 people during the day, but this system of trenches was able to deal with the same number in one hour.</p>

<p><strong>Will you describe the day&#39;s work?</strong> - At eleven o&#39;clock in the morning the chief of the Political Department arrived on his motor cycle to tell us, as always, that a new transport had arrived. The trenches which I described before had to be prepared. They had to be cleaned out. Wood had to be put in and petrol sprayed over so that it would burn quicker. About twelve o&#39;clock the new transport arrived, consisting of some 800 to 1000 people. These people had to undress themselves in the court of the crematorium and were promised a bath and hot coffee afterwards. They were given orders to put their things on one side and all the valuables on the other. Then they entered a big hall and were told to wait until the gas arrived. Five or ten minutes later the gas arrived, and the strongest insult to a doctor and to the idea of the Red Cross was that it came in a Red Cross ambulance. Then the door was opened and the people were crowded into the gas chambers which gave the impression that the roof was falling on their heads, as it was so low. With blows from different kinds of sticks they were forced to go in and stay there, because when they realised that they were going to their death they tried to come out again. Finally, they succeeded in locking the doors. One heard cries and shouts and they started to fight against each other, knocking on the walls. This went on for two minutes and then there was complete silence. Five minutes later the doors were opened, but it was quite impossible to go in for another twenty minutes. Then the Special Kommandos started work. When the doors were opened a crowd of bodies fell out because they were compressed so much. They were quite contracted, and it was almost impossible to separate one from the other. One got the impression that they fought terribly against death. Anybody who has ever seen a gas chamber filled to the height of one and a half metres with corpses will never forget it. At this moment the proper work of the Sonderkommandos starts. They have to drag out the bodies which are still warm and covered with blood, but before they are thrown into the ditches they have still to pass through the hands of the barber and the dentist, because the barber cuts the hair off and the dentist has to take out all the teeth. Now it is proper hell which is starting. The Sonderkommando tries to work is fast as possible. They drag the corpses by their wrists in furious haste. People who had human faces before, I cannot recognise again. They are like devils. A barrister from Salonica, an electrical engineer from Budapest - they are no longer human beings because, even during the work, blows from sticks and rubber truncheons are being showered over them. During the time this is going on they continue to shoot people in front of these ditches, people who could not be got into the gas chambers because they were overcrowded. After an hour and a half the whole work has been done and a new transport has been dealt with in Crematorium No. 4.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh good, I guess we should totally believe him then! 80,000 in one night is no problem because he says so.</p>

<p>How about this:</p>

<p>Zyklon-B takes 2.5 hours to out-gas. Morgues cannot be &quot;ventilated&quot; (those two which had ventilation) until this has completed.</p>

<p>Thus, 10 batches x (2.5hrs + 30min ventilation + a generous 1hr to clear room) = 40 hours.</p>

<p>Never mind that they&#39;re dragging 2000 bodies out the front door of these buildings to supposedly burn them in pits somewhere while the next 2000 are lined up, watching.</p>

<p>Never mind that the bodies are contaminated with cyanide residue and couldn&#39;t have been safely handled.</p>

<p>Never mind that Hilberg&#39;s most-cited witness, a supposed Sonderkommando, said he ate and drank while clearing bodies from the morgue.</p>

<p>Let me just ask -- do you agree with Hilberg&#39;s estimate that 4400 bodies/day could&#39;ve been cremated in 46 retorts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should start reading some more reliable sources instead of just Holocaust-denial literature. The ventilation of the gas started after just 20 minutes. If the sonderkommandos (prisoners who were forced to move the bodies) had to enter the chamber before it was completely safe, they wore gas masks.</p>

<p>Some Holocaust deniers also greatly exaggerate the necessary concentrations of cyanide and the residue, extrapolating from the amount used for fumigation. But humans are much easier to kill with cyanide and very little residue is left.</p>

<p>TTrns, I think it&#39;s natural to recoil at the horror of people being so systematically slaughtered. Any sensitive person would want to deny that it could ever happen so ruthlessly and cold-heartedly. It&#39;s hard to think about the men, women, and children crowded into the gas chambers and exterminated.</p>

<p>But it did happen, and it&#39;s important to remember that. It&#39;s not that the Germans were particularly evil. It&#39;s clear that in any population there are many people who can be manipulated to kill and commit other evil acts and a few who delight in such acts.</p>

<p>You may quibble about this or that number, but you should remember on this anniversary that there about 7,000 prisoners still surviving when Auschwitz was liberated. Similar numbers survived at other death camps. There were <em>thousands</em> of eyewitnesses who saw the people who were marched into the crematoria buildings and never came out. There were thousands of witnesses who smelled the stench of burning flesh.</p>

<p>Vast crematoria were built and expanded when <a href="http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/topf/">80,000 a month was not sufficient</a>. There&#39;s no explanation for that except systematic slaughter.</p>

<p>I have yet to hear you try to explain <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/killedtable.html">where all the Jews went</a>.</p>

<p>Zyklon-B takes 2.5 hours to out-gas. There would be no point in ventilating until it had stopped. This is a technical detail that the hoaxers were not aware of at the time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This has been [explained] many times over. Shipped to Palestine off the books by Mossad, transported east by the Soviets in massive numbers, died naturally, died unnaturally, emigrated out of Europe independently.</p>

<p>I think you need to get over your obvious prejudices and actually read the revisionist writers. You might learn something. I&#39;d be happy to suggest some books and essays.</p>

<p>it&#39;s just the tip of the iceburg, but yeah, there&#39;s numbers to support anything any how ya want when done right =) weither ya down vote me or not</p>

<p>also you redditardos, the dv is for off topic, not for answering the question with something you didn&#39;t like in your lil circle jerk. literally you are jackoffs, thank you. (this is for those it applies to only, the rest of you thank you for knowing how to reddit. =)    -)</p>

<p>You know what isn&#39;t efficient <em>at all</em>?  Gas chambers and torture victims/prisoners.</p>

<p>edit: Not saying the Nazis didn&#39;t do horrible and fucked up things re: torture, medical experimentation.  Just saying I&#39;m in the &quot;It was probably less frequent than as is presented in some eyewitness testimonies&quot; group, mainly because they were logically more valuable as slave labor than anything else.

    <div class="md"><p>never said anything on my opinion of what happened in those days. I see your point, i even upvoted your original statement along those lines, and this one as well. Because i agree, if they&#39;re running a death camp, they&#39;re killing ppl in all kinds of ways. you gotta realize though that there were torture victims. Infact, without the nazi experiments on the jews in the camps, brain surgery would still be anchient compaired, because no one ever dared just open someone&#39;s head up and poke around while they were still living and kept them living long enough to study key aspects and regions of the human brain. fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just hit on the key piece of evidence.</p>

<p>Bullets and ditches are fast and cheap. If killing people for &#39;ethnic cleansing&#39; purposes that would be the way to go. Do you know how many technical challenges are presented by mass gassings? The Germans had a hard enough time not killing themselves with the properly-designed delousing chambers.</p>

<p>People need to remember that the Jews (and other camp prisoners) were a basically free source of skilled and unskilled labor alike for the Germans...whose (nearly) entire male population was serving in a two-front war. If they were killed off the Germans would have lasted MAYBE two years in an active war...and probably not even that. In the ultimate of ironic circumstances...the Jews kept Germany running. There simply were not enough hands to build the German machines of war without reverting to cruel slave labor practices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure it is cheaper but it is way less efficient in the long run because it causes more problems. </p>

<p>Remember Katyn and how big the ditches were for 23000 soldiers? </p>

<p>Now x 15 for Auschwitz. It asks for way more hassle and human ressources. The entire forest around A-Birkenau wouldn&#39;t be enough. Also once buried a corpse can still bring infections, diseases etc. </p>

<p>If you burn the corpses: no worms, no flies, no diseases. </p>

<p>Also ditches means proofs, obvious proofs of what was going on. (Which was bad for public opinions, a faster allied interventions.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll ask again: do you agree with Hilberg&#39;s estimate that 4400 bodies/day could&#39;ve been cremated in 46 retorts?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ventilation of the gas started after just 20 minutes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zyklon-B takes 2.5 hours to out-gas. There would be no point in ventilating until it had stopped. This is a technical detail that the hoaxers were not aware of at the time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have yet to hear you try to explain where all the Jews went.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has been [explained] many times over. Shipped to Palestine off the books by Mossad, transported east by the Soviets in massive numbers, died naturally, died unnaturally, emigrated out of Europe independently.</p>

<p>I think you need to get over your obvious prejudices and actually read the revisionist writers. You might learn something. I&#39;d be happy to suggest some books and essays.</p>
