Obviously racism and abuse are still not welcome but the idea is to give the community an opportunity to discuss interests, hobbies and other things.
We&#39;ve seen this kind of thing work on other subs so just wanted to put it out there and see what our readers and contributors think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  &quot;Free Talk Friday&quot; is a pretty bad choice for a name.  I&#39;d rather see it, if we have to have one, simply titled &quot;Open Thread&quot; rather than the implications made with a day of the week being associated with &quot;free talk&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m against most of the changes that have occurred on most of the major subreddits over the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nhv01/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver20/">past 5 or so years</a>.  More heavily structured and moderated, rules etc. in most cases.  I think many of these changes were made and implemented to censor reddit more than they were to improve reddit as its gained popularity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping this particular subreddit can avoid making some of those same changes and mistakes that the other subreddits have undergone, like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, etc.</p>

<p>The userbase, the moderators, and an accurate voting system will all be required to ensure the future quality of this place as a thinking ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t oppose the idea, but I&#39;d prefer to see some organising in topics first. Free flow is important, but the Charlie Hebdo post was an important start. We need compilations of relevant information to easily get people on the same level of consciousness. Otherwise we&#39;ll see irrelevant stuff and double posts burying what&#39;s important, over and over again.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Third party involvement in the rise of ISIS</p></li>
<li><p>Pedophilia in high places</p></li>
<li><p>Important voices in researching certain topics (and discussions about on which topics they are trustworthy and when to be suspicious)</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>How long have you been a user in this sub? I&#39;m only curious, as I&#39;ve been here for almost two years, and by contributing fairly regularily, and reading what other regular users have contributed, I have at least a faint picture of their personalities which helps me conduct conversations with them. This helps make the flow of information more efficient, when both ends know the other.</p>

<p>I support the idea to get the &quot;regulars&quot; to try and get a feel for each other on a deeper, less theoretical side, so that when we engage in discussions about certain topics, we can gauge how to say something and not have it heard or construed in any other way.</p>

<p>I also acknowledge there are a lot of &quot;lurkers&quot; here, and even some noobs, which is cool. This could also give them an opportunity to introduce themselves, give a little bio. Hell, it could give all of us a chance to share our stories and how we ended up in this same place. </p>

<p>Exactly. Could help lighten the mood and provide everyone with some distraction from the dire state of World affairs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though I&#39;m new here (been lurking for awhile though), if like to also see an action sticky mabye for every month or so, where we collectively (through a poll or something) decide on a cause to support or protest (ie/ netanyahu coming to town, tpp trade deal, etc and so forth) and use that sticky as a way to link to related groups, ways to get involved, progress, ideas, etc) I like staying informed about everything, but I&#39;d also like to start getting involved in getting the word out about some of the more serious issues. And with so many news stories coming out daily that deserve attention (police brutality, free speech infractions, net neutrality, false flags, etc) I think it would help to have one common focus as well. Just my two cents. </p>

<p>Also: if it were up to me, I&#39;d start by focusing on the netanyahu visit to the usa in a month or two. That makes me sick on so many levels.</p>

<p>&quot;This is not a conspiracy, and here&#39;s why I think it&#39;s not...&quot; I think is valid, but those stupid, &quot;What&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot; comments are worthless and just an attempt to shut down conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, sometimes the &quot;whats the conspiracy?&quot; comments are warrented. It all really depends on the topic and how thr OP presents it to the rest of us. For instance, a poster submits a link about vaccines. Well, we all basicslly know what the conspiracy is... But if a poster submits something, for example, about geocentrism? </p>

<p>Asking &quot;whats the conspiracy?&quot; can sometimes help get the OP to go straight to the point at hand, instead of jumping around a page or watching 45min. video waiting to find out why its relevant and whether you should continue.</p>

<p>Sure, one could just come up with a theory or speculation on just about anything, making just about everything relevant. But i dont think its cute to leave the rest of the folks in suspense, if &quot;discussion&quot; truely is the aim. Thus, it should be clear or obvious. If not, then ask. Thats how i see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If discussion is the aim for the OP, wouldnt it make sense for him to have his angle clear? If it is not clear, and therr is no conversation yet (such as on younger submissions), then by all means,i support the question, so long as it is done respectfully.(Though I agree with you that most of the time its used as a derailment or a beginning of a trollfest.)</p>
