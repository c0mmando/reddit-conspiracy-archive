<p>The majority of posters agree with you. Whether they&#39;re native to the sub or not is up to debate. But your topics mostly spurn discussion and you have 2 or 3 people with &quot;Ilovehitler&quot; usernames posting about how hitler was a great dude.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think you need even more protection when there is already no rule against anti-semitism, holocaust denial or saying <em>anything</em> about Jews that isn&#39;t the K-word. It&#39;s a pretty easy path to walk.</p>

<p>It just sounds you don&#39;t want people who aren&#39;t pro-hitler posting on your hitler threads.</p>

<p>For a moment, just ignore the &quot;Holocaust&quot; and look at Hitler&#39;s war prosecution in comparison to the Soviets or the British &amp; Americans. Without the &quot;Holocaust&quot; the war crimes of those fighting the Germans are FAR greater and more brutal than anything the Germans did.</p>

<p>There is also a tendency to simply ignore the good aspects of Hiterianism, such as anti-usury and anti-speculation policies,  genuine socialist reforms far ahead of anything in the world at that time, monetary nationalism, etc.</p>

<p>Evaluating Hitler and National Socialism are complex and difficult tasks. No intelligent, thoughtful person would make it a binary &quot;pro hitler vs anti-hitler&quot; situation.</p>

<p>Jailing artists, killing jews, being a dictatorship, manipulating the poor, bombing london, invading sovereign countries, attempting to commit genocide.</p>

<p>You say hitler has some problems or faults, you never actually criticise anything to do with him. What did you think of his process of kidnappiong and murdering political opponents? what did you think of kristallnacht? What did you think of the invasion of poland? You&#39;re pro-hitler on all counts.</p>

<p>Jailing artists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not because they are artists</p>

<blockquote>
<p>killing jews</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For being partisans and terrorists. Murdering Jews was punished by laws in Germany and there are <a href="http://robertfaurisson.blogspot.co.uk/2002/06/punishment-of-germans-by-third-reich.html">records to prove this</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>being a dictatorship</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not uncommon in Europe, or amongst Germany&#39;s enemies. Never mind that referendums were held where Germans could support (or otherwise) the <em>temporary dictatorship</em> which everyone understood would last only until Germany got through its crisis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>bombing london</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Churchill initiated the bombing of civilian cities. It took Germany over six months to respond. Their airforce was not suited to long-range strategic bombing, but to tactical support -- whereas Britain planned Lancaster bomber production in 1937.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>manipulating the poor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>? [Labor protections were strengthened, people were given a free house after 4 children, cruise-liners were rented and built so people could go on subsidized holidays, etc -- you&#39;ve been badly misinformed. Germany&#39;s socialist policies at the time make a lot of countries <em>now</em> look bad.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>invading sovereign countries</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To remove the Polish military dictatorship which was killing ethnic Germans, shooting at German passenger planes, making border incursions, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>attempting to commit genocide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For which the evidence is missing and contradictory, or consists of &quot;witness testimony&quot; which is completely ridiculous when examined on a forensic or logistical level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you never actually criticise anything to do with him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure I do. But mostly I&#39;m correcting idiots like you who get their history from Indiana Jones movies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what did you think of kristallnacht?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hitler and Goering gave orders to stop the anti-Jewish riots as soon as they found out about them. They were in response to two high-profile assassinations by Jews, in addition to numerous other anti-German provocations -- yes, technically &quot;anti-semitic&quot; but you must look at the big picture and take Jewish corruption, racism, and Bolshevism into account.</p>

<p>Well, I corrected your statements where they were historically wrong. Perhaps you set me up for that, by saying intentionally incorrect things.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s actually a site that hosts the research (with citations) of numerous historians and writers. You can&#39;t simply dismiss them all with one broad stroke.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, my point is that there is quite a bit of evidence that contradicts these &quot;found&quot; documents. You realize fraudulent &quot;copies&quot; of documents were routinely presented at Nuremberg, don&#39;t you? These were typed on plain paper, and &quot;certified&quot; a &quot;true copy&quot; by an Allied officer. The originals, in many cases, cannot be located in the archives.</p>

<p>This is a very enlightening debate you are sharing here and I would hate to interrupt, but... your logic is faulty. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a black man. Am I proud of it? Well, it&#39;s not of my doing, unlike my website, which I designed very well, of <em>that</em> I&#39;m proud, but... yeah. I don&#39;t have to make excuses for being black, I&#39;m not ashamed of the tone of my skin, it is who I am so yes, I&#39;m proud of it, just like I&#39;m proud of my beautiful hair. Yet, I find white women beautiful, and asian men, and Native American people as well. All the &quot;races&quot;, skin tones, and particular features like almond-shaped eyes and big butts and huge, beak-shaped noses and fat lower lips are all beautiful, just as I like German Shepherds and Yorkshire Terriers and Rhodesian Ridgebacks and Old English Bulldogs. There is not one race I prefer, or esteem more highly than the other, not one I like least, and not one I want to totally eradicate, exterminate, and wipe from the map of the planet, not one I think should rule over the others or enforce its values over any other, nor one which should be slave to any other. I see they all have different characteristics, a sort of &quot;identity&quot; or &quot;stereotype&quot;, which is mostly, obviously, for cultural, not genetic or &quot;inherent&quot; reasons, but is valuable nontheless and adds to the beauty of differentness and diversity. I think we should all live in peace and harmony, and all I said is true except that I&#39;m European, &quot;white&quot;, with Asian, Frisian, and (just maybe) Jewish ancestors mixed in many generations ago. </p>

<p>Just because some idiot racists who know nothing about history or politics regurgitate some bullshit they found somewhere does not make everyone who makes an effort to share the truths he found an anti-semite, racist, Nazi sympathisant or white supremacist simply by contradicting the dominating narrative. I, for example, think that the best way to achieve peace and prosperity for all mankind on this beautiful planet of ours we will be forced to share for quite a few millennia still is by getting rid of all the lies and taboos that were fabricated to keep everyone in place (divided, that is), and if only for the simple reason that then the idiot racists - be they black or white or brown or pink with yellow and green stripes - would have no ground to stand on anymore.</p>

<p>People should be free to share information about history without being called names. If the information is false, debunk it, so it can go down the sewers of oblivion and background noise. If it is correct, adjust your world view or be stubborn, and carry on. Why make claims that everyone who isn&#39;t ashamed of being white or black or brown or pink with blue and magenta stripes is automatically racist?</p>

<p>So stop talking about racism and it will go away? yeah, that doesn&#39;t work. Honestly I&#39;m not even sure what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>I think we should all live in peace and harmony, and all I said is true except that I&#39;m European, &quot;white&quot;, with Asian, Frisian, and (just maybe) Jewish ancestors mixed in many generations ago. </p>

<p>This is a nice wish but racism exists.</p>

<p>I didnt say any of that. I said people who say &quot;white pride&quot; are all racist. I&#39;ve never talked to a person who wasn&#39;t a racist who was proud of being &quot;white&quot;, whatever that means. I have no problem with peopel taking pride in being a <em>minority</em> or <em>nation</em>. But white isn&#39;t a thing.</p>

<p>I have no idea how a &quot;I don&#39;t see race&quot; person ended up on a thread about Jews. But yeah I have no idea what you&#39;re even trying to say here.</p>

<p>White pride is a term used by white supermacists exclusively. Gay pride, as a counter example, is not often used by bigots. So ... yeah, historical context matters.</p>

<p>Did one? I&#39;m not a &quot;I don&#39;t see race&quot; person, I&#39;m a &quot;I find all races beautiful and I don&#39;t judge by race&quot; person, and I ended up on a thread about how the constant accusations of &quot;antisemitism&quot; and &quot;racism&quot; against each and every person trying to shed some light onto what really happened are totally annoying and not helpful at all. Because I&#39;ve been accused of being a racist as well a lot for saying fiat money + usury is a Ponzi scheme, and I&#39;ve been accused of antisemitism for saying a tower does not fall through and out of itself from top to bottom without some help which shook me deeply back then. It&#39;s a topic I have had personal experience with. I almost really became an anti-semite just to make a point - if they accuse me anyways, without any basis, why not act accordingly? Of course never became a racist. That doesn&#39;t resonate with my spiritual Feng Shui at all. But I still wonder why people are still so quick to draw that blunted &quot;racism!&quot;-sickle to stifle objective debate whenever someone says something they don&#39;t agree with if only somehow a connection can be drawn to (THE) Jews. That&#39;s how a &quot;I find all races beautiful and I don&#39;t judge by race&quot; person ended up on a thread about the suggestion of &quot;a rule banning baseless, knee-jerk accusations of &#39;racism&#39; or &#39;anti-semitism&#39;&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Glad that you asked :-) That all people who are not racist should embroider a swastika on their favourite t-shirt to make its dark magic by association powerless and charge it with positive emotions again as a sign of luck and prosperity, like in the good old days. That people should be able to come forward with their evidence and reasons if they are true and sound, even if everyone else disagrees. That nobody should throw the worst of all accusations around as if they were candy beyond BBE date to disrupt scientific debate, because it renders the accusation powerless after some time, like the kid that cried &quot;Wolf!&quot; too often (I mean, what words will you use if one day <em>really</em> some whackos start sending people of a particular race/creed/nationality into concentration camps again? &quot;Racism?&quot; lol, the last time you said that you were accusing someone on the internet whose intentions you didn&#39;t know at all). That I hope the day will come when all this divisiveness will be over and we can start co-operating instead of fighting each other over bullshit. </p>

<p>Absolutely right. Basques, Nordics, Bretons, you had moorish people (Beethoven!) and Mongolians all over the place in Europe, constant movement north-south east-west because of wars and famines and whatnot. But look if you don&#39;t find differences between East African and West African phenotypes. Or the gradient between Greece, Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Hindistan and Thailand to Japan or the north route via Georgia and Tuva, then around the Bering Strait or Hawaii to the Eskimos and Azteks. They&#39;re all proud of what they are. Why wouldn&#39;t the same be allowed to people who identify as &quot;white&quot;? </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying.  Since mostly banks and politicians and corporations are behind the Ponzi scheme, which, I was told, is a hidden code for &quot;Jews&quot; (presumably because many bankers, politicians and producers are Jews) and so the mathematical proof for the monetary system being a Ponzi scheme only reveals a hidden, latent, racist, genocidal ideology. I&#39;m not making this up, you&#39;re getting the mortal remains of six million people rubbed under your nose when you say money needs demurrage. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>some of your most recent comments seem to be debunking 9/11 conspiracy theories</p>

<p>Yes, I love to debunk plot hole ridden narratives. Where did Gandalf get Glamdring back, or Luke his green lightsaber? Why did the Twin Towers collapse? Why does George Clooney float into outer space in &quot;Gravity&quot; absent the required momentum? Why are astronauts drowning in their suits? Why is ISS footage never longer than a vomit comet 0g-phase? And why did all the dwarves go north - is earth hollow after all?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you don&#39;t really think the jews did 9/11 did you? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, the Jews are cool. But I do think there were Jews among those who profited from 9/11, that I do think. Jews, and Christians, and freemasons, nihilists, atheists, satanists, islamists, even the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses and the Pastafari. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or is this the &quot;dancing israeli&quot; argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know of an Israeli dance, called the &quot;Hora&quot;. It works well to classics like &quot;Havah Nagila&quot;. I know what story you refer to, but is that a Real Case Against Jews like the one Marcus Eli Ravage presented?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;nobody should call people racist because it ruins the word and people will not think racism is a bad thing anymore!&quot; ridiculous logic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that what you take from it? You think too complicated. Laws must be short, sweet, precise and to the point because it later is important to be able to interpret its intent.</p>

<p>&quot;You should not call people racist without reason, because racism is a bad thing!&quot; Replace racist with wife beater or whatever. It&#39;s not cool. Do it only to escalate aggression. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably genocide? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ridiculous! It was called &quot;genocidal&quot; when a Cologne Landgericht decided the amputation of the foreskin without medical indication constitutes a violation of the child&#39;s human and constitutional right to intactness (because a Muslim boy&#39;s initiation ritual got botched and he had to be sent to hospital) to settle a legal question. &quot;Jewish life would be impossible in Germany&quot;, the Rabbi said on prime time TV, how <em>dare</em> <strong>this</strong> very nation impose its laws on the <em>very</em> thing that defines Judaism. You know, a Landgericht. No, &quot;genocide&quot; is too small a word, it&#39;s blunt and used up as well. Try something that really cuts through the heart. A phrase so outrageous, it stirs unstoppable revolt against an injustice of so vast proportions, a horror beyond imagination you can&#39;t describe it. </p>

<p>&quot;Genocide&quot;, pfft. It would not be the first nor the last one in the history of mankind. No, a mightier, sharper word you need. The one to end all debate and make the evildoer realize his idiocy and repent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Racism refers to feeling better than other races, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hm, hm, hm, yes, it says something like that in my dictionary. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ie being proud you&#39;re white and not a minority.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whites are not a minority? What? I don&#39;t quite follow you. You don&#39;t make any sense, please explain. </p>

<p>Only whites can be racist? What? A Negro, a Jew, an Asian, an Eskimo, an Arab, a Massai, a Navajo, an Aborigine cannot be racist? Do they become white from being racist? Flush out all their pigments with their urine by speaking &quot;I am proud to be white, and not a minority, and I will rape and enslave and torture and utterly devour with cleansing fire and flame all Untermenschen with more skin pigments than me!&quot;? Ah, you sweet summer child, you know nothing yet about cruel communities among Islamists and Black Supremacists and the gangs in Israel harassing people of colour, of Turks in Germany complaining about Gypsies and Russians in France about the Polish, how the Han relate to the rest of China and how Native North Americans are secretly plotting the total annihilation of the White Man in retaliation for the genocide. Are they all racist or just scared of something they don&#39;t understand and have no control over? </p>

<p>If you wish, you may now come to your senses. </p>

<p>Im defending both sides, actually. I align myself with those who view pathological holocaust revisionism posting as a sign of blatant or latent (depends) racism. When the comment history checks out, well, it is supportive. But i also align myself with those who say that there are things that dont add up in the official story. Whichever way, i will not claim things as fact, as both sides of the argument are riddled with inconsistencies, logical fallacies, and speculative claims passed along as fact. So i stand apart from both groups, as well. (If that makes sense)...</p>

<p>I havent considered that you might be using an alternate account for such a topic. That makes sense, amd i wouldnt blame you. However, i find that still questionable, as  i have commented plenty of times about holocaust revisionism, and participated many times in these kinds of discussions. Nobody calls me a racist, or antisemetic. Why is that? </p>

<p>I have questioned the official holocaust narrative, and yet nobody sends me PM threats, nobody creates a thread about me over in r/isrconspiracyracist, and nobody attacks me with ad hominem in a manner that you describe. There must be a reason why i am able to discuss these things, when others are less successful. Theres gotta be something that causes others to have to use alternate accounts, when i dont have to.</p>

<p>There is a difference, between you and me, and betwen the others and me. </p>

<p>Btw, for what its worth, i want to thank you for being cordial about this. You must understand my skepticism of your motives, but also keep in mind that there is a fair balance in life, and its grayscale, not black/white. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the part I&#39;d like you to explain. I just don&#39;t get it -- it&#39;s a disagreement about events in history, and the meaning of various types of evidence. Please explain how that works. I know of no other situation where accusations of racism are raised in this manner. I know of no other historical issue where people are imprisoned for talking about evidence which contradicts the official narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There must be a reason why i am able to discuss these things, when others are less successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect that&#39;s because you may attack the anomalies and inconsistencies in the orthodox historiography less aggressively than I do, less frequently, [potentially less effectively, and presumably taking a more moderate position overall.]</p>

<p>I don&#39;t pull my punches -- we know for a fact that witnesses lied about gassings, and false confessions about gassings were achieved through torture. (At least 10 camps in the Old Reich were said to have been the site of gassings, and they were dropped in the 60&#39;s after Broszat&#39;s mysterious announcement.)</p>

<p>Edit: Finally, please try to understand that many people involved in revisionism are (in terms of motivation) far more focused on the Germans than the Jews -- it&#39;s the German people who have been falsely accused, caricatured as monsters, and held collectively responsible. This, on top of what the Western Allies and Soviets did to them during and after the war. I know the Holocaust Industry wants to make all of WWII a Jewish thing, but it&#39;s really not -- it&#39;s far more about the Germans. The people didn&#39;t want the war, the NS regime tried to solve the Polish crisis peacefully, and they repeatedly tried make peace with Britain starting from the very begging of the war, to no avail.</p>

<p>Although framed in a reasonable manner, your comment amounts to a defense of this disruptive, dishonest, and anti-intellectual approach to discussion and debate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im defending both sides, actually. I align myself with those who view pathological holocaust revisionism posting as a sign of blatant or latent (depends) racism. When the comment history checks out, well, it is supportive. But i also align myself with those who say that there are things that dont add up in the official story. Whichever way, i will not claim things as fact, as both sides of the argument are riddled with inconsistencies, logical fallacies, and speculative claims passed along as fact. So i stand apart from both groups, as well. (If that makes sense)...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>separate account for Holocaust revisionism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I havent considered that you might be using an alternate account for such a topic. That makes sense, amd i wouldnt blame you. However, i find that still questionable, as  i have commented plenty of times about holocaust revisionism, and participated many times in these kinds of discussions. Nobody calls me a racist, or antisemetic. Why is that? </p>

<p>I have questioned the official holocaust narrative, and yet nobody sends me PM threats, nobody creates a thread about me over in r/isrconspiracyracist, and nobody attacks me with ad hominem in a manner that you describe. There must be a reason why i am able to discuss these things, when others are less successful. Theres gotta be something that causes others to have to use alternate accounts, when i dont have to.</p>

<p>There is a difference, between you and me, and betwen the others and me. </p>

<p>Btw, for what its worth, i want to thank you for being cordial about this. You must understand my skepticism of your motives, but also keep in mind that there is a fair balance in life, and its grayscale, not black/white. </p>

<p>You are now. Rejoice! Ask, and learn. How is it possible to be proudly white and not be a racist asshole? Easy. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t have time to check but weren&#39;t you pretending to be non-white the post before this? maybe it was someone else. </p>

<p>But no, sorry. None of what you said really made any sense to me. Maybe it was a good read for someone else. &quot;white&quot; isn&#39;t a thing to be proud of. It&#39;s not even an actual ethnicity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I&#39;ve been accused of being a racist as well a lot for saying fiat money + usury is a Ponzi scheme,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t even make sense</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and I&#39;ve been accused of antisemitism for saying a tower does not fall through and out of itself from top to bottom without some help which shook me deeply back then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m so confused, some of your most recent comments seem to be debunking 9/11 conspiracy theories, and you post to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. And you don&#39;t really think the jews did 9/11 did you? I know the conspiracy theory but if it happened the US was behind it. Or is this the &quot;dancing israeli&quot; argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That nobody should throw the worst of all accusations around as if they were candy beyond BBE date to disrupt scientific debate, because it renders the accusation powerless after some time, like the kid that cried &quot;Wolf!&quot; too often</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;nobody should call people racist because it ruins the word and people will not think racism is a bad thing anymore!&quot; ridiculous logic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(I mean, what words will you use if one day really some whackos start sending people of a particular race/creed/nationality into concentration camps again? &quot;Racism?&quot; lol, the last time you said that you were accusing someone on the internet whose intentions you didn&#39;t know at all)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably genocide? Racism refers to feeling better than other races, ie being proud you&#39;re white and not a minority.</p>
