        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Every taxi / uber on the road takes 10 - 20 personal vehicles off the road.  It&#39;s in the best interest of auto/oil companies to keep the number of taxi/rideshare vehicles at a minimum, via the current limited-supply medallion system.  Taxi companies benefit from this limited supply as their permits are worth more.  It makes sense for both car companies and oil to fund anti-Uber PR to keep auto and oil sales high.  Taxi/auto/oil are likely collaborating on helping spread &quot;Uber-rape&quot; and privacy scare stories.  It&#39;d be very hard for GM and Toyota to publicly say &quot;We don&#39;t want rideshare service to spread&quot;, but they can quietly fund their distaste for rideshare via the taxi industry.  Compared to giant worldwide Uber, taxis are just &quot;the little guy looking out for itself.  It&#39;s a great narrative that the general public and policy-makers can get behind.  Meanwhile behind the scense, auto/oil players lobby for measures that prohibit rideshare.</p>

<p>Looking to the past with the same logic, there&#39;s an argument to be made that auto/oil was behind the implementation of restrictive taxi medallion systems in the 1930s to keep the number of shared cars on the road at a minimum, and purchase of private vehicles at the maximum.  I mean, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy">it&#39;s been widely acknowledged that auto/oil teamed up to buy/bankrupt public transit systems in the 1940s-50s</a>, so why wouldn&#39;t they also want to limit the number of taxis at that time too ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any form of efficiency Or sustainability implemented in our socieities kills businesses, profits, the markets, the economy, value of the dollar and is anti-capitalist by its very nature of saving resources or labor.  That is why any monetary system / capitslist system is all bunk / rotten / corrupted to the core.</p>

<p>Uber makes it possible to car share, it&#39;s not the most effective way of implementing a widescale car sharing program (as it&#39;s not teh most cost effective means) however, it is effective enough to be adopted by a large enough minority of the community that it dents the pockets of car manufacuters selling more cars, reduction in employment - taxi drivers fee collections, government tax collections through car sales and gas sales, loss of sales of aluminium/steel and other metal manufaturers to car manufacturer corporations, reduction of fees for car insurance collection agencies with less cars insured, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>Car sharing represents a serious threat, and as the greater amount of society notices how effective it is, it has the possibility of only requiring 1/40th - 1/100th the production of cars that are currently being used.  That type of loss of sales could crash the entire economy, destroying the currency, and causing a world market crash / great depression.  </p>

<p>And thus, Capitalism and / or the monetary system, is completely Anti - Sustainability and Anti-Efficiency. We can Never have a healthy just society / world, without getting rid fo capitalism and the monetary system all together.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>indeed, but it&#39;s more of a challenge then most think.  Think of programs for not just car sharing but Tool sharing, agriculatural farm machinery sharing, room sharing, sharing services like internet and such, sharing of more free education, sharing access to 3d printers to print our own products instead of purchasing them, sharing of open source technology openly instead of patenting, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>Every form of sharing whatever service, anything that increases Efficiency of our labour (more for less) has an impact at hurting capitalism / monetary system. We have a lot of battles ahead of us, and the market will be fighting us every inch of the way... A contraption meant to serve society, will openly be defying the peoples interest until we change the system and rid ourselves of our chains to any means of exchange.  If we wont, then they will want to keep exploiting us every opportunity along that way... guess the big question is, which path will we end up choosing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the type of communist model everyone thinks of is tyrannical in nature too, the reason why is because it is a Centralized form of control using the monetary system as well, just like capitalism, socialism and feudalism. The ideal economic model to move away from Tyranny requires government (vertical authoritarian power) and the monetary system (any means of exchange) to be abolished. Power has to be distributed horizontal(thus decentralization of power, hence my name, the key to freedom), amongst the people. This is a type of Anarchist lifestyle, also why the attack on &#39;anarchy&#39; for the last century by hollywood, media, politicians, etc. They want to redefine the term to mean chaos, which is a fucken lie! It is everything but chaos, we already have chaos under their rule.  If we removed their rule, there would be freedom not chaos, but the propaganda war against the term has been pretty effective in destroying its philosophy / message.</p>

<p>here&#39;s something i compiled the other day;</p>

<p>NL-RBE &gt; Anarcho-Syndacalism (and similar other anarcho ones minus capitalism one) &gt; Communalism &gt; Ubuntu &gt; Collaborate Commons &gt; Stead State Economy &gt; Capitalism &gt; centralized Communism w/ monetary system &gt; centralized Socialism w/ monetary system &gt; Feudalism.</p>

<p>From best to worst in terms of overall human and environment well being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah quite a few people know about the taxi mafia/cartel set up.  What I&#39;m suggesting is a much larger motor vehicle lobby is funnelling their messaging via the taxis so it looks like Big Bad Uber is &quot;taking out the local little guy taxi companies&quot;.  Customers and policy makers will try to shut down Uber this way, resulting in less availability of on-demand transportation services like Lyft/Uber that results in higher prices of those services so that people continue to purchase, drive, service, insure and park personally-owned motor vehicles.  </p>
