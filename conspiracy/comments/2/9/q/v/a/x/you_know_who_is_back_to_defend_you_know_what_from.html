<p>Now that I look again it looks like the rebuttals have far, far more upvotes than they did just a few hours ago.</p>

<p>It could be happening organically but <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/29pe6z/sandy_hook_hoax_proof/cinh8qn">totes meta bot</a> shows that the thread was recently linked in other places.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s that compelling of a picture, I said my opinion in the thread, but I think it&#39;s pretty clear that people from subs other than conspiracy are joining in now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good response, thanks. I&#39;m only sporadically in this sub, so there may in fact be a vote brigade. As a side note, the theories about governmental control/social engineering and experimentation with social media seems very credible to me. I have little doubt that some &quot;shills&quot; do exist, sock puppets are used  on occasion, etc. Whether they&#39;re being used here, I can&#39;t say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect they would be on reddit too. But this argument about vote brigades or sophisticated social engineering being used to dismiss Sandy Hook begs the question, &quot;Why would the government manipulate conspiracy theories of Sandy Hook,&quot; with the implication being:  the government carried out Sandy Hook as a hoax and is now covering it up. I find this dubious since I don&#39;t think a good case has been made in the first instance for disbelieving the basic mainstream narrative and don&#39;t believe it to be a hoax. To then chain the logic one link further and maintain that social engineering is being used to cover it up seems far fetched. Of course, social engineering might not be connected to the underlying topic at all, but that&#39;s not how I took OP&#39;s post.</p>

<p>And no, I don&#39;t think saying &quot;there is a perfectly good explanation for why people are wearing badges&quot; at the scene of a heinous crime shortly after it began, is sufficient evidence to negate the hoax along with all of the other evidence that just doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a single &quot;live video feed&quot; shows ANY evidence that anybody shot anything, multiple accounts aren&#39;t consistent, witnesses can be paid liars, the police conferences released conflicting statements about where evidence was found, and there is zero proof Adam Lanza was even a real person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No single piece of evidence is likely to provide all answers. For example, even if we had video of Lanza shooting the kids, we&#39;d still have to compare it to photos of him. Then we&#39;d have to establish the photos were really of Adam Lanza. Then we&#39;d want to make sure we were seeing the whole picture, maybe a terrorist was holding a bomb off camera compelling Lanza to take the shots, etc.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t have complete and comprehensive proof (nor would I ever claim that), I think I can reliably say that there was an event at Sandy Hook that day (many camera crews, people, accounts, etc), Lanza was a person (witness accounts, biographies, pictures)...</p>

<p>Now is it possible that someone didn&#39;t create the whole thing? It&#39;s possible I suppose. It would have required a massive coordinated effort involving nearly every media crew in the US, an entire town of people, and the list goes on.</p>

<p>Could it be done? Tell the town you&#39;re shooting a movie or conducting a psychological experiment....still would be tough as people would talk.</p>

<p>But back to the point--yes, plenty of evidence for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of people purportedly knew him and have given accounts about him. Photos are attributed as being him. </p>

<p>Indeed, I never knew Adam Lanza, and he could be a fictionalized character created to manipulate me in some way. But, while that&#39;s true, that&#39;s true of almost every politician I&#39;ve ever voted for, and but for a few celebrities, everyone I&#39;ve ever seen on TV. For Adam Lanza, I sure know a good deal more about him than most I see on television. His biography could be faked, the photos might not be him, etc, but I have far more evidence for his reality than just about any author I&#39;ve ever read, any artist who&#39;s works I&#39;ve admired, architects who&#39;ve designed the buildings I&#39;ve lived in, etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny, too, because the instant someone disagrees with someone like you, they get lambasted and insulted.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t want to find the truth, you want to find people who simply agree with you.  You want attention.</p>

<p>You never actually explain your ideas/thoughts.  You insult and run away.  You make another thread complaining about the other thread instead of actually standing up for your comments.</p>

<p>And, your title here makes it sound like you actually want a discussion about Sandy Hook...but you don&#39;t.  In reality you want to throw all your ideas out into the open...and by &quot;open&quot; I mean the small field where everyone will agree with you.  If you really wanted a discussion you would stop insulting people, you would actually discuss your views in detail, and you wouldn&#39;t make threads like this.</p>
