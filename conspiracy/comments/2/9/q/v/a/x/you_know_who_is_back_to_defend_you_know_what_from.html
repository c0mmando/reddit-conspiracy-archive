       I saw one guy early on that had a 7 year club, which is kind of rare around here.  But he stopped posting 6 years ago and only one post 2 years ago and none of them was in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  As of 4 months ago, almost exclusively, all his posts were in this sub.  So, do we have an abandoned account sale going on and/or mods identifying these kinds of accounts and handing them out?

       I like how the best the paid-to-be-here crowd can do is act like they're too stupid to understand something and ask for someone to hold their hand and explain it piece by piece.  They're not the brightest bunch, especially when trying to be sly and act out their little performances, but that's what makes spotting them so easy.

       Actually when I woke up this morning almost every single of the top level posts that had a significant amount of upvotes was in support of the image.  I was actually very surprised. Usually this kind of stuff is full of rebuttals by the time it hits the front page.
      </p>

       Now that I look again it looks like the rebuttals have far, far more upvotes than they did just a few hours ago.

       I don't even think it's that compelling of a picture, I said my opinion in the thread, but I think it's pretty clear that people from subs other than conspiracy are joining in now.

       That's a good response, thanks. I'm only sporadically in this sub, so there may in fact be a vote brigade. As a side note, the theories about governmental control/social engineering and experimentation with social media seems very credible to me. I have little doubt that some "shills" do exist, sock puppets are used  on occasion, etc. Whether they're being used here, I can't say.

       I suspect they would be on reddit too. But this argument about vote brigades or sophisticated social engineering being used to dismiss Sandy Hook begs the question, "Why would the government manipulate conspiracy theories of Sandy Hook," with the implication being:  the government carried out Sandy Hook as a hoax and is now covering it up. I find this dubious since I don't think a good case has been made in the first instance for disbelieving the basic mainstream narrative and don't believe it to be a hoax. To then chain the logic one link further and maintain that social engineering is being used to cover it up seems far fetched. Of course, social engineering might not be connected to the underlying topic at all, but that's not how I took OP's post.

       I think I'm upset that you people only show up if Sandy Hook is on the menu.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I don't think saying "there is a perfectly good explanation for why people are wearing badges" at the scene of a heinous crime shortly after it began, is sufficient evidence to negate the hoax along with all of the other evidence that just doesn't add up.

       For me, it's interesting because I see very little to make me question the official narrative (which I'm sure is wrong in some regards). But, that basically, a psychiatric case did something pathological, shooting up a school--seems an obvious explanation that needs pretty hard evidence to sway me from.

       You're apparently convinced, and  that's fine, but to me, I just don't get the theory.

       Not a single "live video feed" shows ANY evidence that anybody shot anything, multiple accounts aren't consistent, witnesses can be paid liars, the police conferences released conflicting statements about where evidence was found, and there is zero proof Adam Lanza was even a real person.

       No single piece of evidence is likely to provide all answers. For example, even if we had video of Lanza shooting the kids, we'd still have to compare it to photos of him. Then we'd have to establish the photos were really of Adam Lanza. Then we'd want to make sure we were seeing the whole picture, maybe a terrorist was holding a bomb off camera compelling Lanza to take the shots, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't have complete and comprehensive proof (nor would I ever claim that), I think I can reliably say that there was an event at Sandy Hook that day (many camera crews, people, accounts, etc), Lanza was a person (witness accounts, biographies, pictures)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now is it possible that someone didn't create the whole thing? It's possible I suppose. It would have required a massive coordinated effort involving nearly every media crew in the US, an entire town of people, and the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be done? Tell the town you're shooting a movie or conducting a psychological experiment....still would be tough as people would talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       But back to the point--yes, plenty of evidence for me.

       The theory is that aside from you being told that's what happened. There isn't evidence to suggest that it did or that a kid named Adam Lanza ever existed.

       Plenty of people purportedly knew him and have given accounts about him. Photos are attributed as being him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, I never knew Adam Lanza, and he could be a fictionalized character created to manipulate me in some way. But, while that's true, that's true of almost every politician I've ever voted for, and but for a few celebrities, everyone I've ever seen on TV. For Adam Lanza, I sure know a good deal more about him than most I see on television. His biography could be faked, the photos might not be him, etc, but I have far more evidence for his reality than just about any author I've ever read, any artist who's works I've admired, architects who've designed the buildings I've lived in, etc.

       A road construction sign saying "everyone must check in", the multiple portapotties, the badges that many people are wearing, and the fact that evidence was apparently tampered with,  no photos of ANY crime scene evidence showing the front window which was supposedly blown out, should I continue?

       Precisely. They feel it's our duty to provide evidence of an obvious conspiracy. It's not enough that we point out that there is no evidence of a crime. Baffling really.

       It's like you guys live for the circle jerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny, too, because the instant someone disagrees with someone like you, they get lambasted and insulted.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't want to find the truth, you want to find people who simply agree with you.  You want attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       You never actually explain your ideas/thoughts.  You insult and run away.  You make another thread complaining about the other thread instead of actually standing up for your comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, your title here makes it sound like you actually want a discussion about Sandy Hook...but you don't.  In reality you want to throw all your ideas out into the open...and by "open" I mean the small field where everyone will agree with you.  If you really wanted a discussion you would stop insulting people, you would actually discuss your views in detail, and you wouldn't make threads like this.
