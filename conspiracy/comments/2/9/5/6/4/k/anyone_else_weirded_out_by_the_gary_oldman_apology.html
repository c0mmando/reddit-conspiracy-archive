       Apparently he made some anti-semetic remarks, and he just "apologized" on TV. It was eerily similiar to Jonah's apology when he made some remarks that didn't fit the bill. Pretty sure Gary was making fun of Jonah while also proving that Jews are certainly at the point of control where you can't even call them out on their bullshit without serious repercussions.

       made the same comment long time ago on reddit, I was compared to hitler at some point.

       the same old shit everytime  when You say some truth about the jews.

      <p>
       look how the movie industry is doing perverting people at young age.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example when you see jonah hill explaining how he got his part in the wolf of wall street movie as if he  begged leonardo di caprio to get him the part its totally bullcrap, he was imposed as part of the cast by the higher up jews.

       how the movie industry has vilified African Americans since forever, from the eye rolling scardey actors of the thirties, to the pastiche and semi-serious modern attempt of Psyche.

       I'm getting tired of "apologies" after making statements.  Don't apologize for saying what you believe.  It doesn't matter if I like or dislike what you say.  Stand by what you believe, don't back down and cow tow for other groups.  I have a painting hanging on my wall for my kids to see.  It says "speak the truth, even if your knees shake".  If you believe it is the truth, stand up and say it.  Even if you fear the repercussions.

       In practice you are right.  In theory, if enough people do it, they cannot stop everyone.  You can't ostracize everyone without making a scene.  Had both mentioned Mel Gibson being taken down for speaking out, people would listen.  Maybe they wouldn't.  Guess I'm the type that will go down in flames if I believe what I'm standing for is right.

       The idea that how you mean things doesn't matter sickens me. How you mean something is everything. You can say one thing and a million people will have a million interpretations of it. It's not up to me to try and find a way to say something that will make all of those million people feel OK.
It's my job to express how I feel and do so in a way that satisfies my need.

       sins, removing the chosen people marker and making all humans God's children.  By apologizing and saying the Jews are the chosen people he is blaspheming our God

       You did not, what I 'm trying to say is that jews only care about themselves I live in a small french city, and the jewish community are the 1%, they live in the most expensive areas and occupy the highest paid jobs in the city, nothing trickles down no money no oportunity its like they closed the game.

       Why be sarcastic about this though?  This "chosen people" propaganda results in politicians talking about Judea-Christian principles as if that is or even could be a thing.  Gary Oldman's a weak shill.  I bet he said those offensive things, just so he could apologize later.
      </p>

       Gotta remember, Gary was in the Dark Knight series and everyone here knows how that was part of NLP programming.  Why not this?

       You obviously don't understand english people or their humor, as he was obviously taking the piss, moreso in his written apology which "wasn't good enough" for emperor Foxman from the ADL. Even in Gary's televised interview he smirks at :55, right when he's copying the HR script that Jonah probably based his apology on. Obviously Oldman is scared for his life in the interview, but doesn't mean he can't be a little cheeky. They probably threatened his life, more importantly his family's so of course he has to apologize. And the Dark Knight issue... some of the guys on that project tried to warn us and were killed for it, have some respect just cause they are on a project doesn't mean they are in on it.

       Think about it: it's against Judaism to believe in Christ so no Judea-Christian values.  It's against Christianity to put anything before Christ so no Judea-Christian values.  And if you don't believe in the whole lot(!) then it's against your values.

       Yeah, we had the same God but then the Romans killed Jesus while the Jews rejoiced.  There are similarities, but also many differences.  Judea-Christian values do not, nor have they ever existed

       It's still the same God. The God of Abraham and Isaac. Both Jews and Muslims recognize Jesus as a prophet.

       Judeo-Christian values have existed for decades, unless you deny the Ten Commandments. That is why the term exists.

       If Christians, Muslims and Jews all believe in the same God why is it Judeo-Christian values instead of Judeo-Islamic-Christian values?  Or Abrahamic values?

       Judeo-Christian values is a propaganda term and I think you realize that yourself since you said they've only been around for "decades."  Jesus has been around longer than decades sir!

       There are many terms that have only been around for a short time that are related to religion. I get that you have an axe to grind so there is no way you will admit to anything Jew related, but facts are facts. I'm sorry that upsets you.

       Yes, i agree and that's why I stand by my original statement.  I do not mean to quarile, my statements were only meant to highlight propaganda used by politicians, not sow division.
 I'm sorry if I have upset anyone by any of my previous statements but the facts remain: "judeo-christian values" is a catchphrase used by the Illuminati as a slogan for their war in the Middle East.  People need to be aware of what these phrases mean because they describe policy, without knowledge of which, citizens cannot expect to be free.
