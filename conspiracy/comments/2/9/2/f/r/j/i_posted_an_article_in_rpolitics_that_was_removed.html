       deflects blame from Walmart, and shifts it to the state of the economy.

       that was deleted for being "Off Topic."
      </p>
      <p>
       Though both posts point to the same article, the title in the new post was changed. Changing titles to fit a narrative is against the rules, but the post wasn't removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question is: Why was this post allowed to remain up while another identical post was removed for being "Off Topic?"

      </p>
      <p>
       Our rules are all publicly posted. They weren't before.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a wiki with all domain removal reasons documented.
      </p>
      <p>
       We post comments or flair on every removed article.
      </p>
      <p>
       We vote on each change to policy, and don't make changes until a formal vote has been taken. Each time there's a change, the publicly accessible wiki is updated to reflect it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are significant changes that have increased the transparency massively from the 'old days'. There's no inner workings; everything is posted up for all to see. If there are inconsistencies, that is purely the work of the human element, moderator training (Half of the staff are newer-ish) or simple differences in opinion on how to apply the rules. These inconsistencies are always on our mind and we are constantly working to make everything more uniform as we go.

       I've asked 5 times in modmail over the past 2 weeks why every single comment or post I make to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is instantly deleted and not a single one of you has replied to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been given no reason for the actions against me.  I broken none of the rules of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no "transparency", you just add people to your censorship lists and hope they'll go away.

       One last question: What are the steps involved in adding a new moderator to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a background check of his account?
Is there any way to verify he doesn't belong to a political organization or works PR for a corporation?

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Vote to start accepting new moderator applications
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Write app thread, and vote on the finished product application thread (which I wrote and posted, by the way)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wait for apps

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Vote to close app thread
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wait 2 (or more) weeks while moderators watch post histories and read past histories. (Someone usually writes up an analysis table with pros/cons for each user)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Open nominations from the app pool

       <li>
        <p>
         Vote on nominated apps
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Send out rejection/approval notices
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mods are added with extremely limited permissions (link flair, modmail, post approval/removal)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         After a certain time, they're given access to the wiki via a vote by the full mods
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Eventually they're nominated to become full mods with ban power and subreddit config access

       Post histories can be completely fabricated though. If I posted in
       <a href="/r/TwoXChromosomes">
        /r/TwoXChromosomes
       </a>
       for six months you could reasonably assume I was female.

      <p>
       It would be
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       easy to crate a neutral post history and portray myself as somebody who would moderate without bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       is why I don't trust the moderators, and believe that moderator logs should be public instead of private. I also believe users should be able to democratically vote out moderators who abuse their power.

       Unfortunately, we mods can't change the way the Admins built the website. You're right that post history can be fabricated, but so can educational credentials, government issued ID's, and anything else in the world.

       I don't know, but to be fair and consistent we removed it. It should have been removed sooner but an error by one of our newer mods caused this issue which does happen from time to time. We are just human volunteers after all.

       What kind of answer do you expect?  Reddit is not a democracy.  You cannot vote off moderators you don't like.  The constructive reaction is to create your own subreddit, and run it better.

       The kind of answer an intelligent adult would provide, not that defensive childish bullshit.  For real, you should be ashamed of yourself.

       In response to your second statement, police forces aren't democracies either and yet even they have (limited) repercussions to their actions.  I would say it isn't a stretch to consider mods like the police force of Reddit.  Is it too much to ask that a lazy/shitty/corrupt mod be able to be stripped of their influence/authority?  If you honestly can't see the necessity of those types of measures, you aren't fit for any sort of authority to begin with.

       These same guys that commented here from politics banned me for pointing out to the people that already commented that the post had been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the real kicker, the guy who took down my post, put up his own right afterwards.  I point that out and get banned.

       I think this is just proof that people abuse their power.

       Edit: reworded for claritry.  Use to state that I didn't think it was a conspiracy, but I meant it to be a huge conspiracy on a global level and what not, but I believe it is a bunch of small people thinking they are going to change the world through controlling content on a website.

       Why is it that a group of mods need to come to explain/protect the mod that did whatever. Why can't it ever be just one mod or THE mod that deleted to defend against his/her actions. So much baiting in some of their answers as well just beating around the bush with a non-answer.

       Has this whole situation not taught you to be wary of blindly putting your trust in a website?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason reddit is being attacked so hard is because it has such a large audience. Diffusing that audience into different websites is itself a successful attack on reddit.

       whoaverse has about 100 users and one person running it. What do you know about that one person? Did you read the privacy agreement? What is to stop that one person from deciding to make unilateral changes? He was overwhelmed by 100 new users.

       I can post links important to me here on reddit and know thousands of people can see it, or post to a hundred people on a site run by one guy who has total control.

       The rule you are questioning is temporary to combat the bots and trolls. It will be removed in a couple months when the community can combat them without vote restrictions...

       I just don't see why there's a point in using that site with such a horribly rigged voting system. It lets the people who have been there the longest decide what ends up on the front page. No thanks, I'd much rather reddit's current voting system.

       I didn't call you retarded, I simply stated that your argument reeks of a member from conspiratard. You being so devastated that you have to have imaginary internet points in order to downvote people, it kinda says that you want to go over there and downvote away, but since you can't... you are upset about that fact...

       I'm not devastated. I just think it's a shitty system which doesn't allow most of its members to have a say in what content gets to the front page or not. I don't even have an account there, I was put off by the vote rigging and the fact that the entire site is run by members of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       so it seems a bit like an echo chamber.

       All I can say is maybe you should understand why things are done instead of blasting it with no understanding. Once again, it's not rigging, it's a protection in order to stop people with ill intent from making an impact. Because honestly, I would rather deal with a downvote restriction than have my account go from +70 to -43,254,365,442,312 overnight

       Guys, if you don't know by now this site is a farce, there really isn't much left the admins and (many of the) mods can do to show you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like America has(had) the illusion of freedom, there exists the illusion of democracy on Reddit.  As Frank Zappa once said, the illusion is no longer profitable:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The illusion of freedom will continue as long as it's profitable to continue the illusion. At the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain, they will just take down the scenery, they will pull back the curtains, they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater.”
      </p>

       I would give gold for this if i could for the Zappa quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being somewhat new, i don't know or haven't had enough experience to see or form an opinion of subversion on Reddit. However, since it is basically a totally open forum. And nefarious  intentions could proliferate here easily. If the CIA or whoever wanted to start a massive disinformation campaign, which the odds are there probably already is somewhere on this site. Then nothing can stop that really.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been of the opinion lately that while the internet has seemingly made us "more free" as a global community as a whole or at least opened the doors to conversation, education and brought people together. It is easily more likely that it could be turned against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without constant exhaustive research on topics, and information found on the internet. We really have no way to tell what is true or half true, or biased or utterly false. Most people don't have the time for that, and those who would want to spread disinformation for an agenda know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our governments know and in fact rely on the basic ignorance of the people.

       What kind of answer do you expect?  Reddit is not a democracy.  You cannot vote off moderators you don't like.  The constructive reaction is to create your own subreddit, and run it better.
