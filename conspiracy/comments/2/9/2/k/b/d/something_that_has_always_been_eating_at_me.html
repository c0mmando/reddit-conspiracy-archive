        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have read the rules at I think this fits within them. I do not have a link to submit as the following information is from my own observation. </p>

<p>I grew up in a town that only exists because of the Manhattan Project. Before then there were only a few farms. Being that this town exists because of that project, the people who settled here are from all over the United States so there really wasn&#39;t any common enthnicity.</p>

<p>In school there were about a dozen kids in my class of about 80 who were all with the same blond hair, blue eyes, extremly magnetic personalities, excelled in academics and athleticism,  and had lots of money. There weren&#39;t any children who matched this description in any other age group.</p>

<p>These people were all friends and didn&#39;t associate with other children outside of school. Any time I would attempt to talk to them, they would get upset, almost angry, and push me away. Everyone seemed to love them but I couldn&#39;t understand why. I have seen others try to associate with them and get pushed away, even abused, and still admire them.</p>

<p>Even more strange thing is that some of their parents didn&#39;t even have these features. It seemed way out of the ordinary for this to be a coincidence. Was this a case of selective breeding? </p>

<p>This all happened in the 90&#39;s and early 00&#39;s. I could be crazy, I could be on to something, and I could just be posting this in the wrong place. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?</p>

<p>-Quick edit. Added paragraphs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alexander The Great. He didn&#39;t look like either parent; he looked like Apollo, whom his mother maintained he&#39;d been sired by until her dying day. All king Phillip knew is that the child hadn&#39;t been sired by him, and was as certain Alexander would never be king of Macedon as his wife was that he&#39;d never get another child. Upon his father&#39;s murder, and his extraordinary brilliance and cruelty managed (just barely) by Aristotelian logic, Alexander went on to conquer and unify the Hellenic world. And when it looked like his conquest would end in defeat at the siege of Tyre, &quot;flying shields&quot; appeared and blew holes in the city&#39;s 40 foot thick walls so his army could enter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paragraphs dude!</p>

<p>Wow this is pretty interesting (though, ill take it with a grain of salt, obviously...). Ive always wondered about the possibility of something like you suggested, but ive never seen it myself so i reserve my belief in something like that until i get tangible evidence.
Let us know if you find something further...</p>

<p>Also, this is a good place to post something like that, IMO. Thiught provoking material is always welcomed (by me, at least). I actually prefer self.posts over links because they tend to support discussion more... </p>

<p>With that said, if youd like to speculate on some details and go further (while keeping in mind it will be speculations/conjecturing, as there is no evidence you can provide--as you said) then im sure some of us here would be willing to play along. Whether its true or not, its still entertainment. The plausibility of it, though, is whats intriguing.</p>

<p>Maybe it was that &quot;blond boy&quot; thing of the 90s where people are physically attracted to them. It still doesn&#39;t explain why all of them were both more acedemically and physically advanced compared to the rest of the students. Perfect grades and never tired during P.E. and recess sports. There was a little league team with a bunch of them and they always won by a huge difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First time I open a self.conspiracy and I am not disappointed :)
Unfortunately I don&#39;t know nothing about it :( But since I like animes and saw a bunch of them that made me think, for some reason what you are saying make logic and seem tangible, although without something like a pic it&#39;s hard to really get in touch with your parameters of equality nor verify the aspect of the subject, anyways I read some of your responses and the way you describe your statements seems true so having that on mind..</p>

<p>What if they were just a small community at the beginning and then grown up.. the academics, well since they were a community sharing knowledge like ways of learning or even traditionally self-instructing themselves and somehow got it easy at school..    </p>

<p>Some other side of this coin, could be hybrids.. it&#39;s well known that we human are aliens, since the cells that ultimately evoluted and now are called &quot;humans&quot; were carried by a meteor..  Another good insight in this matter is to research about the Sumerian theory of life which was also their religion, and it points out that we were the 7th planet, since or solar system has 10 planets, the last one being nibiru and the 9º pluto the smallest planet on or solar system, they also provide  information about the formation of rhe rings of Saturn, they also talk about how human beings did not evolute from mokey but with genetic manipulation, since the first human being didn&#39;t had a belly button ;) and yes it&#39;s caled Adam in the bible ( I am not catholic ) and drew the shape of the DNA although they shouldn&#39;t had the knowledge of its existence.
So why not hybrids like some said..</p>

<p>Ultimately a government project.. They are so many technology that goes to public, and a little of that are things like &quot;chips in the brain for diabetes&quot;, it does work but what&#39;s next nor going on?</p>

<p>Cheers :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of them seemed to be the alpha of the group. He is pictured in the right of the image that I submitted. I remember him once talking to another one kids saying something along the lines of &quot;I always get what I want&quot;. I have not seen any of them in person since early high school. I think they all went to some prestigious colleges and never returned.</p>

<p>I do remember one instance where in middle school I bummed a ride from my brother from the local super market since I ran into him there. A group of those kids were all standing out front and staring at me with this disgusted look on their faces as I was walking out and also as I was leaving in my brothers van. I&#39;m not sure what their deal was then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some gated communities but the only people who lived there were old retired golfers. The area that the school is in is the upper class area of my town. All of the industrial stuff is in the two neighboring cities mostly. No undergounds and this area was built starting in the 70s. The northern part of town has been around since the 40s</p>

<p>North of here is the Hanford site which is where the United States produced most of it&#39;s plutonium but all that ended around 70s I think. It&#39;s all cleanup now and I think the last of the plutonium was removed in the very early 90&#39;s. I worked out there for a while and it&#39;s all empty buildings with only some spots of contained radiation. There is also a nuclear power plant with nothing special about it other than 2 unfinished reactors next to it.</p>

<p>South of here is a chemical weapons depot that has been closed down for a few years. </p>

<p>West of here is the Yakima firing range, which is where the military does exercises at along with the japanese.</p>

<p>East of here is really nothing.</p>

<p>-edit: now that i think of it there were 2 large fallout shelters and pipeworks/tunnels between the high school and middle school but they have since been removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The place with the cranes is the &quot;Vit&quot; plant. Its full name is the vitrification plant. It glassifies radioactive waste by superheating it. It&#39;s not finishes and has been delayed way too many times. The water spots are probably part of the whole &quot;pump and treat&quot; system. It sucks up water from the aquafer below the site and cleans it from leaked waste. Those pools may just be holding non radioactive water to be pushed in since it&#39;s cheaper than building tanks for it. I looked at it again and the singular squar pools used to be a part of the old coal power plants that were located next to them.</p>

<p>I have seen others try to associate with them and get pushed away, even abused, and still admire them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not blonde-haired, blue-eyed or even attractive, but I have the type of personality that often does that to people. The pushing away, that is.</p>

<p>The oddest thing I&#39;ve found in it is that some people&#39;s response is to want to keep trying to get closer. It&#39;s as if the rejection increases their desire to try again. They want what they can&#39;t have, just because they can&#39;t have it? Human nature at work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right and It could be human nature to want what they cant have. This could all be a coincidence and I&#39;m just over thinking it. The kids who were pushed away didn&#39;t seem phased by it though. They still seemed to idolize them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah tri-cities. I didn&#39;t know about that area, Hanford I mean. It&#39;s neat to browse that area with Maps. It looks like they&#39;re either putting warehouse/factories up or tearing them down. They could&#39;ve always built something underground if they still call the area private property. You never know, plus its fun to think about secret genetics.</p>
