<p>Disclaimer, I&#39;m not knowledgeable of the movement with exception to the one google employee, Justine Tunney who took the twitter hastag. From one article a I saw a while ago she seemed to get the banker picture, though the article wasn&#39;t very exploration besides that one aspect... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Info wars site links are mostly truthful, as A.J. does it to legitimize himself which gives him a platform to viraly seep his fear mongering to his audience. Fear mongering in consecutive rounds causes a psychological anomaly known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">learned helplessness</a>. Other things like the A.J. Stratfor connection are covered and documented well by this individual <a href="http://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/">Fitzpatrick Informer</a>. Stratfor has been discovered to be a intelligence program used to cattle and spy on dissenters, people signed up on the infowars site might be signing up to a watch list. Former employees have come out an talked about A.J. as well, Jack Blood I recall being one of the more predominant ones. </p>

<p>I still go to infowars for links, as long as their not tainted with A.J.&#39;s over the top fear mongering or mass predictions of doom and as long as they properly linked to their sources, a practice carried out by real citizen journalists. The final crux for me with A.J. is that he was invited to film an Illuminati ritual, there&#39;s no way in hell anyone can film one of those without being killed, unless they&#39;re part of the same group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, thanks for the info.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, Jones goes over the top many times in his radio broadcast (which he admits from time to time, ie-&quot;I make the show unlistenable when I get excited&quot;), but I don&#39;t get the feeling at any time that he&#39;s lying about anything, doesn&#39;t believe what he&#39;s saying, or disseminates misinformation or disinformation. I&#39;ve been listening daily since about 2006, and I cannot recall anything he&#39;s ever said or done that would please, or be of service to, the elite. The fact that he constantly exposes things that need to be exposed for the betterment of humanity is evidence enough for me that he&#39;s trying to do good.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The fact that infowars.com subscribes to the Stratfor newsletter, along with Michael Ruppert and Mike Rivero doesn&#39;t mean much, other than they signed up for the <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/free-reports">Stratfor newsletter</a>, which anyone can do. Why wouldn&#39;t a news service, or someone monitoring the elite sign up? Hell, I just did because I&#39;m interested in what sort of info they&#39;re disseminating. It seems any news service worth their salt would, if they have some sort of worthwhile intel. Even if Stratfor disseminates disinfo, people well versed in elite chicanery can easily sift through that stuff. Know your enemy, right?</p>

<p>This Fitzpatrick fella says &quot;<a href="http://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/stratfor-had-two-alex-joneses/">Stratfor had two Alex Joneses</a>.&quot; The thing is, the article states that only one Alex Jones worked at Stratfor, who he admits is not Alex Emerick Jones, the radio show host. Because someone at infowars.com signed up for the free newsletter doesn&#39;t mean Stratfor &quot;had Alex Emerick Jones,&quot; which is what Fitzpatrick is insinuating.</p>

<p>If you do a <a href="http://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?q=%22alex+jones%22&amp;amp;mfrom=&amp;amp;mto=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=0&amp;amp;file=&amp;amp;docid=&amp;amp;relid=0#searchresult">search</a> in the Wikileaks dump for &quot;alex jones&quot; with quotations for exact-match, what you&#39;ll find is Alex Jones, the Stratfor webmaster talking about tech stuff, and the Stratfor staff talking about (making fun of) Alex Emerick Jones. Nowhere in the emails will you find any evidence of Alex Jones working with Stratfor. The fact that the staff is bashing Alex Emerick Jones is more evidence that Alex is trying to do good in my eyes.</p>

<p>Jack Blood</p>

<p>Yes, I remember when Jack Blood &quot;exposed&quot; Alex. The only thing immoral that he talked about was Jones&#39; staff faking Jones&#39; autograph. That&#39;s pretty low, but isn&#39;t enough for me to stop listening to him, or thinking he&#39;s a bad person. I believe Jack Blood was telling the truth about this, but there&#39;s always the chance that he was seeking revenge for feeling back-stabbed by his former friend and business partner. This really isn&#39;t provable unless Jones admits it himself. Woops, just saw you provided the YouTube link. I&#39;ll re-listen to it now. I still listen to the Jack Blood show on occasion (I got out of the habit of checking deadlinelive.info for new shows when he was only doing new ones sporadically. Looks like he&#39;s still not doing many new shows lately, which sucks. I really liked his show.)</p>

<p>Wait, what? How did I miss this? Can you provide a source? You aren&#39;t talking about Bohemian Grove are you? Because he wasn&#39;t invited to that.</p>

<p>And, <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/08/02/why-alex-jones-bashes-the-nazis/">really</a>? Do you identify as a Nazi? Was a family member of yours a Nazi? I&#39;m sorry, but I have no sympathy for Nazis, National Socialists, or Adolph Hitler. If that&#39;s your underlying reason for not liking Alex Jones, well, then everything about your perspective makes sense to me now.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to reassess some things as you&#39;ve raised some valid points, as well thank you for taking the time to read my sources, such an investment of time more then I could ever ask of anyone. </p>

<p>I do encourage you though to look into Learned Helplessness, if you observe A.J. you&#39;ll know his over the top predictions are part of the programming. This leads into my major point of contention with A.J. which I forgot to mentioned prior, that being that he&#39;s not here to bring others, generally anyone with any curiosity who&#39;d temporarily step outside of the MSM(mainstream media bubble) into the truther fold. I&#39;ve seen rock solid citizen journalists who source everything they say in their podcasts or live radio streams with links to the things they talk about. They lay out the facts and approach a viewer new or established with this base so that the viewer themselves can research. A.J. does not do this, he does not fight with logic, his performance which it is is a joke, he turns off so many people including myself before I was deep enough into independent media to take a second look at him, and I came out of the MSM bubble through libertarian media thanks to this fellow at <a href="http://porkinspolicyreview.wordpress.com/">Porkins Policy Review</a>. </p>

<p>Now for the Nazi accusation, I wish to relay simply that history is nothing like we&#39;ve been told. Nazi and WWII research was not my area of interest to research, I thought before too that the Nazi&#39;s were flat out murderous, genocidal maniacs who murdered Jews for sport. That&#39;s until someone posted the Leuchter Report and the following Gremar Rudolf reports which show in factual basis that the Gas Chambers in the camps were in fact not real, that they we&#39;re perpetuated lies by western governments, then I found footage from a film reel that Spielberg made showing camp members telling their stories which appeared to be from an alternative reality, that&#39;s how different the stories and the propaganda are from reality.  </p>

<p>Then there are a host of books on Allied and Communist atrocities carried out against the German people after WWII. I remember my history text book which was awash in allied heroism when the fact of the matter is that our governments are truly the axis of evil as shown below in the materials.</p>

<p>To preface some of the materials, Fred Leuchter was the primary manufacturer of gas chambers in the United States, he sold a host of death equipment to state prisons including electric chairs, intravenous injection material and was the go to man for consultation on death equipment. Leuchter became interested in examining Auschwitz when he was solicited for the defense of Ernst Zündel, a Canadian who also worked to expose the holocaust lie, and whose free speech was unconstitutionally violated by the Canadian government. He hired Leuchter to prove that Auswitz was in fact not a murder camp as propagandized by western governments and as such the Leuchter report came about, along with the analysis of certified chemist Gremar Rudolf. These two men went to jail for speaking out against this lie and Leuchter was unfortunately ruined by western governments for helping to expose the Zionist Rothschild conspiracy. </p>

<p>So when Alex Jones or anyone else in the field says their a history buff, and that they say in the same swath that Hitler was evil, they&#39;re straight up liars. I do not have a lot of materials for Hitler, its excruciatingly difficult to find materials on the true history of WWII because of the absurd amount of historical revisionism. The one thing I know is that the MSM and the Rothschilds revile Hitler considering he&#39;s so heavily vilified, this also has lead me to research who golden dawn in Greece truly is, possibly another true anti Zionist Rothschild banker party. </p>

<p>The materials are lengthy, but so is this lie, I cannot expect you to waste all you time on this however know that history is nothing like we&#39;ve told. </p>

Fear mongering in consecutive rounds causes a psychological anomaly known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">learned helplessness</a>. Other things like the A.J. Stratfor connection are covered and documented well by this individual <a href="http://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/">Fitzpatrick Informer</a>. Stratfor has been discovered to be a intelligence program used to cattle and spy on dissenters, people signed up on the infowars site might be signing up to a watch list. Former employees have come out an talked about A.J. as well, Jack Blood I recall being one of the more predominant ones. </p>

<p>I still go to infowars for links, as long as their not tainted with A.J.&#39;s over the top fear mongering or mass predictions of doom and as long as they properly linked to their sources, a practice carried out by real citizen journalists. The final crux for me with A.J. is that he was invited to film an Illuminati ritual, there&#39;s no way in hell anyone can film one of those without being killed, unless they&#39;re part of the same group.</p>

<p>Gremar Rodulf report isn&#39;t to long, its quite solid in showing the gas chambers to be fake, part of historical revisionism by western nations.</p>

<p>Alternative History: Nazi Germany, the alternative version(discliamer, this topic is extremely hard to research, I do not, and cannot vouche for the accuracy of this version of events as shown below). </p>

<p>Hmm, I posted a lot, though the issue is not small in its context... Hope this is somehow informative and a little direct as mentioned above, and as usual if your curious make sure to research, there&#39;s a lot of disinformation and I have trouble myself verifying the facts in a sea of misinformation. </p>
