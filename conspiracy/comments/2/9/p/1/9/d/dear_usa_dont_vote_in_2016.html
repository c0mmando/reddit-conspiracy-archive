    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my thought. Even if you had 30%, that would send a message. The problem it Americans are too cowardly to get out in the streets. Too ignorant to know what to protest anyway. A lot of people know things are fucked but people don&#39;t know what to do. I say stop paying your &quot;membership dues.&quot; It&#39;s not like it matters. They got the magic money printing fed. Who cares if they don&#39;t get my return or money. I mean, really, how does it even matter when we&#39;re pushing $18 trillion dollar debt, not even factoring in unfunded liabilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been actively waging this very campaign since I turned voting age.  It&#39;s been over twenty two years so far and counting.  Haven&#39;t visited a ballot box once.  It&#39;s literally all bullshit designed to keep the plebs dumb and powerless by giving them/us the false impression that we actually have any choice in matters that have zero to do with us and whose outcome was already decided long before any vote was publicly presented.</p>

<p>On this planet, there&#39;s the government that&#39;s presented to the people, and the government that <em>really</em> exists...and one often has little to do with the other.</p>

<p>I can almost guarantee you that there will be a whole hoard of people getting on the &quot;Go, Hillary Clinton!&quot; bandwagon and pushing for her to become president so that they can &quot;cry tears of joy on this momentous, historic, civil rights occasion!&quot; when she gets elected.  <a href="http://static.tumblr.com/wudjgth/RWwm1k4b0/shoot_me.jpg">Woohoo!</a></p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t you see it?  Don&#39;t you <em>get it!?</em>  This shows and proves that we REALLY <em>ARE</em> as a country and as a people moving forward into the new millennium!  Look!  We have a <em>female</em> as our president!  Oh this is the happiest day of my life!  Almost as happy as when we had the fist <del>black</del> half black president!  Oh, such joyous times we live in!!&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah.  It&#39;s <em>really</em> all bullshit in this country.  Hillary will continue the hilarity of bullshit which is the United States.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people in the general public know just how surreptitious and lacking in honor and morality this person is.  I wonder how many people know that her <a href="http://www.stewwebb.com/2013/05/13/hillary-clinton-fired-from-watergate-committee-for-fraud-ethics-violations/">history of immoral activity goes back <em>at least</em> 40+ years</a> - in which time she&#39;s probably done much, <em>much</em> worse and has had ample time to perfected her shitty dealings.</p>

<p>Ya&#39;ll think Barry is bad? (and, boy oh boy is he bad)...Just wait for Hilarity Clinton to laugh her way to the oval office.  I wouldn&#39;t be the least surprised if shit <em>really</em> hits the fan even worse then.</p>

<p>Ultimately, OP, I think your idea would be absolutely frickin&#39; awesome if <em>everyone</em> did it.  It would definitely send a message to TPTB.</p>

<p>I bet the boat will continue sailing on, however, even if - hypothetically speaking - NO ONE voted.  And what would that show?  It would show that votes never counted for shit all along anyway.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you vote or not.  The same shit-heads will get in power anyway.</p>

<p>Something vastly different (other than thinking that voting as its set up in this country will change anything) needs to be done if things are to change and improve here.</p>

<p>While I still suspect most elections in American (and abroad, in certain nations) are likely rigged, with U.S. Presidents chosen years if not decades in advance, it would be counter-intuitive to simply not vote out of protest. In the event you are mistaken in your assertions, you&#39;re essentially allowing your own preconceived notions to silence yourself politically. </p>
