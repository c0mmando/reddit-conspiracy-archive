I googled &quot;troops&quot; and &quot;Arizona&quot; and here is the screen shot. Headlines go back to May..

    <div class="md"><p>The problem that I have with this story is that it&#39;s full of &quot;may haves&quot;. First, as mentioned in several sources, the incursion, if that&#39;s what it was, amounted to 100 yards into the U.S. in a desert area with poorly defined boundaries. That could happen in seconds. Second, the sources that have provided details state that the helicopter fired two shots, hardly a war. U.S. sources also state that BP agents were in a unmarked vehicle and nobody was harmed and there was no property damage. Finally, there is no mention anywhere at all  that U.S. law enforcement agents were involved in a drug interdiction operation. In fact, the Mexican government stated that it was the Mexican Army that was involved in an anti-trafficking operation and U.S. sources do not disagree. It looks from all sources that the U.S. BP officers just happened to be there, in their unmarked vehicle.  A hundred yards is very close range in a firefight with helicopter cover, so it is much more likely that the Mexican LEOs in the helicopter were firing back towards Mexico. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe... and I&#39;m just throwing this out here-</p>

<p>As stated in comments, the helicopters are contracted help by the US, or maybe they are part of our government. It seems to me that the shots fired, were warning shots. It just sounds like they were there to guarantee a precise path and to prevent interference.</p>

<p>What if the sickness/contagion reports are a lie meant to serve as one more reason to do something now. The one clip I saw was stagged. Kids, not sweaty or looking parched, calmly waiting in line to get a drink of water out of a jug (FOR THEM TO SHARE WITH ALL THAT DISEASE). They were standing beside what I recall to be a bus. Kids, hot ass desert, sick... soooo, lets stand in the heat in line sharing a jug that some lady who appeared to be in the medical field is holding onto. Wouldn&#39;t heat exhaustion/stroke be a real issue with that day&#39;s heat, illness, blood pressure, No emotion to read at all. The shot was framed, and the kids were posed. I <em>might</em> be wrong. </p>

<p>Pretend I am 100% right. Why stage this? What is the goal?</p>

<p>I seem to remember the border being a campaigning tool, with the GOP wanting to shut down the boarder while dems where accused of being sympathetic to law breaking criminal aliens.</p>

<p>Finally, if Mexico is firing on us, that&#39;s an act of war. Shoot the kids. Blow them up. We do it all the time overseas. I guess people of color are people as long as they aren&#39;t Muslim. That&#39;s progress. <em>looks at cup of water, considers the cliché, and notices scabies floating in it.</em></p>

<p>EDIT: What if the disease thing will serve as the reason why they are quarantined, and we cant see them. I mean, that&#39;s a lot of children. They will have to be taken back home if this is a false flag. </p>

<p>Has anyone noticed anything regarding clothing or such that would indicate northern or southern Mexico, gang affiliations (I know they are kids), or perhaps a country further south? Maybe dialect?</p>
