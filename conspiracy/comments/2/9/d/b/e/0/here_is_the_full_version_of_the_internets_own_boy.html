<p>Thank you so kindly to <a href="/u/nullc">/u/nullc</a> for this upload; his beautiful words are beyond anything I can muster on this at the moment. The world lost one of its best with Aaron&#39;s passing; and may we never forget what he did for this site, this internet, and this world. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The work is an poignant, factually focused work, suitable both for people who are closely familiar with the background and those who are not. The film is heavily sympathetic to Aaron and his plight, but not at the expense of accuracyâ€” in my personal experience. I found it a bit difficult to watch at some points, but that might be due to friendships with so many of the people being interviewed. I&#39;d happily recommend this film to anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, after watching this documentary, I&#39;m inclined to believe Aaron was murdered. After all he went through, does it make sense to commit suicide, by hanging of all things, just weeks before your trial, after you fought and won all those impossible battles?
If I was facing that jail time, I&#39;d at least wait for the verdict. Plus his father said that the government killed him, and all of this was downplayed very skillfully by the msm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And death by hanging was used as an example to transgressors of the law, it was supposed to be more of a deterrent than a punishment, cause it takes so long to die by hanging by the neck. If he was really fed up with everything, why not jot down a handful of pills and drift to sleep from which you never wake up?
Only reason somebody would hang himself would be to draw attention, and he had the eyes of the world on him.
I don&#39;t see him doing this, not when he was winning, not in a million years. I never knew the guy, but he fought for me even before I realized I was under attack. I feel as if I lost a brother that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m, honestly, still on the fence about the whole damn thing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Aaron wanted to be a burden any longer at that point; but I also think that he was being targeted by the government in a manner which they knew would lead him into a bad place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you mean, but what I got from this documentary is that he made a fool out of the DEA, and was raising hell of a mess with the establishment. He made laws disappear that would otherwise be in place even then, the SOPA act was drafted by 40 congressmen, they needed 60 to pass it. With Aaron making it public, he showed the people what kind of power they really posses. The details of the &quot;suicide&quot; are also sketchy, as is the coroner&#39;s report. He was winning, and so were we. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time they deal in such a way with threats they cant publicly. All of this reeks to high heavens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American government is very effective at psychological torture. Once they profile you, and  they learn of all the ins and outs of your life, all they have to do is twist things to place you in a dark depressed cell of your own creation. If you become a problem, and won&#39;t take yourself out, they have systems that will take you down. Incarceration and &quot;accidents&quot; are popular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest evidence I&#39;ve seen for murder was his final photo.  Who was taking the photo?  Why not tell Aaron he was being photographed so he&#39;d look at the lense?  Why capture a somber moment with neither smiling, and only the girlfriend looking at the camera?  His girlfriend also found him fwiw.  Inventing the securedrop method of submitting documents to the press shows how dangerous him being alive could be to the establishment.

    <div class="md"><p>I was very sad through the end segment of the documentary handling Aaron&#39;s death. But when I heard how pancreatic cancer &quot;kills the shit out of you&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but laugh. The smile stayed with me through the end as this development <em>has</em> to be convincing enough to allow for easier access to scientific journals. If there is one thing that can act as the end all for meaningless disputes like this, it is the literal &quot;cure for cancer.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What bothers me is the insistence of his friends and family that he wasn&#39;t a criminal; as though being a criminal is a monstrous accusations.</p>

<p><strong>We are all criminals</strong>, if only because of the computer fraud and abuse act; but also because it suits those in power. The justice system does not exist for us, let alone to protect us, it exists to control and suppress us.</p>

<p><strong>Do not empower the powerful by fearing criminals</strong>. That is easily one of the most effective tools they exercise in controlling us, and it is enabled by our complicity.</p>

<p>Aaron was showing how &quot;they&quot; want to control everything. If anyone threatens that control they come with &quot;full force&quot; after you. It also shows how the government / corporations looks down at the smart people. The nerds comment was the worst!</p>
