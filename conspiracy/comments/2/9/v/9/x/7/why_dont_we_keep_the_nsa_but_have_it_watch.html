       I hold out hope for the hackers and NSA employees to change the system. The worst enemy is from the inside and the NSA employees live in a 1984 environment. And are watch all the time. All they have to do in get mad about it and they will trust me. Plus the Government doesn't work now and will fall if it does not catch itself.

       If my observation is wanted: Right now there is much "

       We know that some leaks have been of things done in response to Snowden, after he no longer had access…  and we have been told that other leaks were not part of Snowden's material.  We
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       know how many more people with access have grown a conscience, but the minimum number is one.  This is encouraging.  "The NSA" is seen as an agency gone rogue against its own people, but it's staffed by those people it works against, and some of them may not have been corrupted.  Hopefully there are enough good people working at a bad job to fight it from within to bring the monster down.

       I guess it's not commonly known that this was the original purpose of the NSA, to monitor
       <strong>
        government employees
       </strong>
       in order to prevent espionage and treason.

       Don't preclude the near-certainty that the deep state agencies (CIA, DIA, NSA, the Pentagon and whoever is behind various black budget offshoots) are higher on the pecking order than "Congress" - a body everyone seems to hate and a useful scapegoat to run interference. I believe
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       members of Congress have a measure of influence, but it just dovetails with their official position

       The NSA is under direct control from those on top. The politicians are under NSA surveillance already. If they don't do, as the wealthy at top please, dambing evidence collected by the NSA is released.

       Look at Spitzer, consistently goes after Wall Street for corruption, voilà mystery leak of sleeping with hooker released by unknown sources to the wealthy controlled media. Wonder who could have done that.../s

       The NSA is mine I pay my taxes and it is yours too. I know it watches everything but does not do any good for the US people and as for your third point it does benefit them this is not 1980, it is 2014 and will lose all power and repect( if it has not already). Thing are moving faster and by 2020 the USA might not be here if we don't wake up and start helping people live good lives or we all die.

       If you think that paying for something makes it yours, then why isn't all the stuff welfare people buy in my house? (I totally agree with your point, but "our" government uses our money to pay for trillions of dollars' worth of goods &amp; services they then tell us who pay for it, "oh, that's not yours.")

       This reminded me of that picture I saw on here awhile ago. It was a comic strip showing the nsa putting more and more radio dishes over U.S citizens but the moment one was faced at the government they had a big problem with it.
