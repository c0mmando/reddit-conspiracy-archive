       I've noticed this on both sides of the conspiracy fence. If you don't actually know, or have any clue on either side, why can't that just be how it is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single "shill" or "conspiracy theorist" has always had an answer for every question, or a youtube link if they didn't actually have the facts.

       Is being a conspiracy theorist, or a believer, like a religion? Truth doesn't matter, but dogma does?

       The people who don't know the answer tend not to speak up, while the people who think they know everything will never shut up about it. So it is they that get noticed more.

       That sure seems to be the case for a lot of people who are convinced that their theory is correct rather than merely worth considering.

       If you are on a conspiracy theory site, it's pretty much assumed that all statements are hypotheses and not statements of fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       People could state "I don't know for sure, but I think..." before they say something but it would get very repetitive and serve no use.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's merely assumed that when someone says "Putin is taking over crimea to access oil rights in the black sea." that what they are really saying is "I believe that Puting blah blah blah".

       A common tactic of shills, or those who mean to discredit you, is the "solve the crime" gambit. Basically, if you take a position that the 'approved' version of events is questionable, your opposition proceeds to try to force you to furnish every detail of how it must have
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       happened. The end result, is that you get so mired down in bickering over the minutae of the sequence of events, that the original argument is completely lost.
       <br/>
       For example, I've seen forum threads run 28 pages with arguments over what temperature thermite burns. I've seen 20 page threads arguing seating capacity on a Boeing 757. I've seen links to entire chapters of Physics textbooks reviewed, dissected, and parsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being, it's perfectly fine to say "I don't know". If you're of the opinion that Something is Rotten in Denmark -- sing your song, baby. Don't get sidetracked trying to figure out how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.

       It seems like with science, as with reality, if you have an explanation for something, you will provide evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can disprove the "official story" of anything, you will be able to provide proof, that is both verifiable, and peer reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody here bitches about the "official story" about the theory of gravity, or germ theory. (Or maybe they do, anti-vaxxers).
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual science would require actual work, where as most people who don't understand or believe the "official story" are not the type of minds to be able to actually disprove it.

       My point, exactly, is that there is five dollars under the pillow. The onus is not on your nephew to explain how it got there.

      <p>
       We aren't discussing gravity here. Or germs. The scientific definition of "theory" doesn't apply to current (or not-so-current) events. I doubt you're intentionally trying to obfuscate things, but the gulf between "theory" and "explanation" is signifigant. If I find a trout in my milk, as the saying goes, and you provide an explanation, I'm not obligated to furnish a complete re-enactment of how it got there, down to every detail, just because I find your explanation lacking.

       The scientific definition applies to everything. It is the difference between a theory, a hypothesis, and a wild guess. It's very important to make a distinction between the different levels of evidence.

       I disagree. It's one thing to say that the approved version of events has holes in it. But it isn't enough, because
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       versions of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       events have holes in them, if you look hard enough - and conspiracy theorists are typically looking very, very hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't expect me to take a conspiracy seriously, unless its proponents can come up with an alternative scenario which fits the data better than the approved version, or at least until they can establish beyond reasonable doubt that the approved version in unsustainable. Holes that have credible. non-conspiratorial explanations e.g. the BBC pre-announcing the collapse of WTC 7 just don't count. And their explanation must be able to stand up to the same intense scrutiny they apply to the approved version.

       I agree - but that would fall into the category of "establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the approved version is unsustainable." However, I would not be satisfied at all with acknowledging my milk is fish-flavored and leaving it at that. To me, that's the START of the inquiry, not the end of it, and I wouldn't be happy until I reached a satisfactory explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm not seeing many trout here, probably because that's the nature of conspiracy
       <em>
        theories
       </em>
       . What we see here tends to be much more speculative, so should be treated as such, and questioned,
       <em>
        every bit as much as the approved version
       </em>
       . If it can't stand that, it's really no better.

       Truth should always be the driving force in most conspiracy theorists quest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having the ability to say one doesn't know opens up the discussion.  Having the ability to admit when one is wrong  is evidently a sign of weakness.

       I wish I could agree more. It seems like both sides are so invested in their positions they can't admit when they don't have an answer for something.

       If you want an extreme example of this, just search out the flat earth society. I still think it's more of a logical test then people
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       believing the earth is flat, but they do help you understand the type of arguments you use.

       check out a recent freakonomics podcast on this very topic it is quite interesting, it boils down to how we are raised and trained (school environment) to always take a shot at "knowing" something, because we are generally punished for that more consistently then we are for guessing and being wrong.

        Put another way, if you piss on my leg and tell me it's raining -- it isn't necessary for me to prove how many pints of ale you may have drank the night before.

       I'm pissing on your leg, you can literally see it happening before your eyes. Why exactly would you have to furnish the details of what I drank, and how exactly does that relate to the point you are trying to make?

       Please help me here.
