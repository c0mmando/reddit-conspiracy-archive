<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I seriously believe various psychotropics can add perspective to your experience of &#39;reality&#39;, but I don&#39;t think &#39;yay drugs&#39; is a panacea, and the druggy world isn&#39;t some romantic underground collective of enlightened individuals fighting for truth against an oppresive force.

    <div class="md"><p>yeah in the UK liberty caps are native, but &#39;prepared mushrooms&#39; are class A (wat?!) so you can technically get in trouble if you are selling them dried or have a fucking fridge full, but as they are all oer the ground during silly season they are sorta de-facto legal.</p>

<p>There used to be some quirk in the law where truffles were legal and there were quite a few mushroom cafes back when I was at uni.</p>

<p>Doing shrooms and watching that shit terminator 3 film in the front row of a fucking massive cinema was one of the most amusing experiences of my life. But I digress, yeah I don&#39;t really think psychedelics are high on the list of old bill busts, the market kind of regulates itself.</p>

<p>Terminator 3, not sure I could handle that, especially on the doses I was taking. For psychedelics over here we All I&#39;ve done is Salvia as it is legal. I was dubious of the acid because, from the Cocaine that went around I doubted the purity, quality and overall likelihood of any actual LSD in the Acid that was supplied around here, as it is a shithole. I&#39;m also certain I&#39;d go insane if I actually did something that lasts 12 hours as intense as acid is.</p>

<p>Salvia on the other hand... fuck me.</p>

<p>Of the dozen or so times I&#39;ve decided to hit some salvia, it has been without fail, a horrible disturbing and lonely experience. Literally nightmare fuel.</p>

<p>Yeah, never liked the long duration of acid, even with shrooms after a few hours you get the &quot;i&#39;ve had enough now&quot; feeling. It gets tiring a day and a half later, start feeling like syd barret!</p>

<p>Lol, indeed, I could give the scientific reason, suffice to say they can&#39;t make it an illegally scheduled narcotic it because they don&#39;t know exactly what the fuck it is, chemically. if that makes sense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s understandable that not everyone enjoys it. After my first time though I loved it to be honest. Can&#39;t say I wouldn&#39;t do it again later in life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the laws, it&#39;s also not just legal to grow opium poppies in the US, it&#39;s actually the opium poppy strains specifically that are protected (papaver somniferum) ... and, not just papaver somniferum, the last time the law was touched directly was by Nixon when he <em>expanded</em> it to <em>also</em> include papaver bracteatum.  ....but <em>only</em> for ornamental purposes.</p>

<p>The DEA has cracked down on this <em>non-</em>elusive wording, and books have even been written about it... to scar them? even accidentally? you&#39;re basically a grower, distributor, dealer, user, etc... to dry the pods and bring them inside? (ie, for &#39;ornamental purposes&#39;) perfectly legal....</p>

<p>the point in question to this is though... why those two strains specifically? There are <em>hundreds</em> of poppy strains... that are all but impossible for the naked eye to tell apart... ornamental or otherwise....</p>

<p>... esp when <em>only</em> somniferum and bracteatum contain opiates (somniferum contains ~90% opiates and &lt;10% thebaine... which converts to codeine) ... bracteaum, on the other hand, contains no, to almost-no morphine, but contains 90% thebaine....</p>

<p>...ie, you grow somniferum for morphine and other opiates, and maybe during the refinement process, get <em>some</em> thebaine (ie, codeine) out of it, but you grow bracteatum for codeine... and pretty much codeine specifically...</p>

<p>so, my point is, I think that there may&#39;ve been a bit more to The Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942 than <em>just</em> &#39;protecting ornamental poppies.  the wikipedia history section on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_somniferum#History">papver somniferum</a> has been edited <em>many</em> times over the past few years alone... and many many many of the articles across the internet have been pulled even remotely bringing into question interpretations... including ones even writing about interpretations in question. The history, and a clear line of it, is, as the wiki history section on it reports, &#39;vague&#39; and &#39;remains somewhat controversial in the US&#39;.     and it <em>definitely</em> no longer mentions Nixon&#39;s 1971 <em>expansion</em> of the Act protecting <em>bracteatum</em> for &#39;ornamental purposes&#39;. </p>

<p>But, it&#39;s still legal to grow them here, next to impossible to prove that they <em>aren&#39;t</em> other poppy types w/out doing a full on chemical analysis of each individual pod, and the seeds of <em>p.somniferum</em> specifically are used for ALL sorts of culinary purposes... vs other poppy seed types.</p>

<p>You can (easily) find the seeds on ebay, I&#39;ve even known friends who&#39;ve grown them for &#39;ornamental purposes&#39; with great success on creating... &#39;potent beauty&#39; in their &#39;ornamental arrangements &amp; concoctions&#39; ....</p>

<p>they&#39;re legal in the UK too, and seemingly <em>much</em> less ominous in the way the drug enforcement agencies approach them there...</p>

<p>At that, the crazy thing is; go to walmart, home depot, lowes, target... whole foods, etc... less and less those now vs what they carried not even 2 years ago... and you can buy poppy seeds of <em>other</em> papaver varieties easily... and they&#39;re in <em>most</em> wildflower mixes sold... ....the <em>other</em> papaver species... <em>not</em> somniferum.  But, I&#39;ve been to locally owned garden centers who&#39;ve said that they&#39;ve specifically had officials come in and tell them not to order more and carry them... in store. ... and this isn&#39;t even papaver somniferum, but poppies in general, and even implied that carrying them on their websites is... potential to open their businesses up to &#39;closer inspection&#39; where it was otherwise protested as being &#39;silly&#39;. </p>

<p>And I&#39;ve run across things that imply that the major seed manufacturers are ceasing product lines both for papver varieties in general, and somniferum specifically if they ever had them for somniferum to begin with.  It would be <em>nothing</em> for an agency to put a business under investigation for a wide number of reasons... the easiest, of course, being IRS audits. or using agents specifically to go over taxes-filed vs just letting automated systems red flag them.. which is also easily done. As a business owner, I can assure you, the less encounters I&#39;ve had with the IRS the happier I&#39;ve been.. and I&#39;ve had them.. and they can most <em>definitely</em> put you through a ringer if they like... and they can do so continually... year after year after year after year. Increased IRS scrutiny alone is reason enough to not want to piss off gov&#39;t officials who are just a phone call away from their IRS counterpart in raising suspicions on a citizen or business&#39; practices.</p>

<p>I obviously deviated <em>far</em> from your point.... which was basically to say: you can grow questionable shit just be careful with what you do with it <em>after</em> it&#39;s grown. (paraphrasing of course).</p>

<p>It would seem though that the <em>less</em> you know about it, or can be implied that you &#39;know about it&#39;, the less likely you are to get in trouble for growing them.  ....and, yes, the various agencies most definitely <em>do</em> have a right to check out what you&#39;re growing.... </p>

<p>..even the linking choices in the wikipedia articles are &#39;dead ends&#39;.... i mean, it shows a link to &#39;turkish opium&#39; (two separate links) ... on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_bracteatum">p.bractteatum</a>&#39;s page as if to &#39;<em>imply</em>&#39; that it&#39;s going to go into more history on it... but it doesn&#39;t... it just links you to a page on Turkey... thus implying, &#39;here, A.D.D. on this and don&#39;t look into the other any farther&#39;.</p>

<p>These pages <em>used</em> to have entire sections dedicated to the &#39;controversy&#39; with multiple links and references backing them up and &#39;riddled throughout&#39;.  Even the &#39;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Papaver_bracteatum&amp;amp;action=history">view history</a>&#39; link implies quite a bit of activity within the past few years.. and a <em>helluva</em> lot in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Papaver_somniferum&amp;amp;action=history">p.somniferum&#39;s &#39;view history&#39; section</a> ... esp if you scroll to the very bottom and choose &#39;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Papaver_somniferum&amp;amp;offset=20120610182457&amp;amp;limit=500&amp;amp;action=history">500</a>&#39; from the list of how many to show</p>

<p>I only go into this because it&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>... and there&#39;s currently been a <em>boom</em> in opium activity around the world, in S.America (read: Columbia) and <em>esp</em> in Afghanistan.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing for or against opium, opiates, poppies, or what not, more transparency....   I tend to lean a bit more towards a &#39;Libertarian&#39; ideology than anything else... going with the idea that all drugs should be legal and the Constitution protects individual rights along such lines... or, well, did... Portugal has had great success with their drug legalization programs ... and saved a <em>ton</em> of money in the process.</p>

<p>You may have but I read every bit of it regardless. Overall I&#39;d say, if I read the intent right, your noting the logic behind the legality of growth and possession of certain plants and substances, as strange and convoluted, with which I fully agree.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It is actually interesting you mention opiates and specifically  Codeine however as OTC drugs such as 22.2&#39;s, (AKA Codeine) are largely abused up here, and the amusing thing is that the Canadian supply comes from legal farms in Australia. Which is why I may lack the mental motivation to address you line by line, as I am currently on a large dose, but again, know I am reading it thoroughly.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never really looked into Wikipedia&#39;s articles on drugs, I mostly use it for Politics, history, war and that sort of thing, but I have noticed <em>a lot</em> of dead links on some &quot;hot topics&quot; recently.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Agencies like the DEA don&#39;t do what they do for American safety and security, but for profit. At least it seems that way since they do nothing about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_and_Contras_cocaine_trafficking_in_the_US">CIA drug smuggling</a> or <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/drug-war-american-troops-are-protecting-afghan-opium-u-s-occupation-leads-to-all-time-high-heroin-production/5358053">US military protection of Opium fields in Afghanistan.</a></p>

<p>It was informative, and I&#39;m also fairly keen on expanding my knowledge about all psycho actives, whether I plan on doing them or not. And I think your suspicions are certainly welcome and relevant in this subreddit.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Even long before I was an addict, I&#39;ve shared that same libertarian ideology. I think it is entirely a waste of money and resources, let alone a violation of individual freedoms to incarcerate anyone for using <em>chemicals</em> not deemed socially acceptable by &#39;reefer-madness&#39; era ideology.</p>

<p>If we were to legalize all substances, it does not have to mean Heroin, Methamphetamine, and Cocaine are to be sold in every corner store like it was in the 1930&#39;-40&#39;s, it just means less wasted money on incarceration, militarized home invasions etc..</p>

<p>This may surprise you to know if you didn&#39;t already, but up here we have &quot;clinics&quot; where Heroin and Methadone are decriminalized, and people can come to treat their addiction, which in my opinion is the best way to settle the problem if done right. Perhaps Portugal has/had something similar?</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;m high as fuck so I enjoyed reading it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha!!! good. I had actually stopped typing it half way through &#39;Portu....&#39; yesterday and came back to it and realized I was boring the shit out of myself relative to rereading what I&#39;d written... why i actually sent it I have no clue but... I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it. </p>

<hr/>

<p>One of the things I did yesterday while typing it was do a little bit of research and printed off a few articles... which I subsequently read over my morning caffeine. I actually found them really interesting and they were pretty quick to read. I had some problems with the longer of the two as it has some incorrect elements and opinion and conjecture riddled throughout, esp as it progressed, but overall it was still an interesting read, def starts out stronger than it finishes though ( <a href="http://www.heroinhelper.com/curious/history/opium_history.shtml">here&#39;s the one I &#39;had a problem with but still found interesting&#39;</a>) </p>

<p>and <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/aof/aof32.html">here&#39;s the other one</a> that is a bit more in line with your DEA sentiment perhaps...  It&#39;s obviously more a &#39;food for thought&#39; to be &#39;rattled around&#39; with other &#39;observations and such&#39; but still found it quite an interesting little read... quick too.</p>

<p>as far as drug legalization... i think Portugal has done a pretty damn good job with it from what I&#39;ve read. I tried to find a post I made a few months back with a bunch of links in it... it had about 5-6 but each was basically arguing the merits of both pro- and non- of Portugal&#39;s approach... ...with progression of it. Sort of an &#39;internet review&#39; of sort that i did for fun or out of intrigue.</p>

<p>In short: from the time it started (ie the earlier articles covering it) until the most recent ones (as of a few months ago).... it&#39;s been &#39;adjusted as it&#39;s matured&#39; but overall, it&#39;s been a great success... and is saving Portugal a <em>ton</em> of money (more, literally, if printed and weighed in $100 bills) and it actually seems like it&#39;s helping people.  Much like legalization in Co... crime is <em>way</em> down, productivity across the country is <em>way</em> up, and overall, people seem happy about it.  ...and, <em>not</em> just &#39;drug related crimes&#39;... crime in general.. across the board... is down. The drugs? they&#39;re also widely available... and quality seems to&#39;ve gone up. </p>

<p>that&#39;s actually something that&#39;s covered in the longer link (I believe) about how as quality increases, people seemingly adjust in a positive way.</p>

<p>Backing out of that...</p>

<p>My argument for how it should be done in larger countries (more focus on geography but emphasis on population as well) is that it should be done locally and/or regionally... much like how in the US Colorado is doing it.. and then others and others, each community adjusting on its own with the federal gov&#39;t more there to.... &#39;police the transition&#39; and to &#39;make sure shit doesn&#39;t get out of hand&#39;.</p>

<p>Clearly there will be bleed over where areas where its legal grow for areas where it isn&#39;t... but... i think that this will adjust things as well... but i personally believe that this will be a good thing... fore, again, quality will potentially increase and people will react accordingly, and ultimately, as successes are shown in those areas, and resentment builds among the local populations... pressures will be put on them as well.  But, also good about it vs a top-down federal approach is each community gets to do so at its own pace and, more or less, within its own structure... some working better than others, period or in-general, and others working better in one community or population-type, while others may not work so well... but a sort of &#39;decentralized learning&#39; can happen more easily this way vs some &#39;do it this way because we, the federal gov&#39;t, say for you to&#39;  ...trying to fit each community into a system that may not necessarily apply for them, and may also make transitions much rougher than they normally would be.... ..also the likelihood of individual or local successes is higher this way, and, thus, more likely to &#39;stick&#39; ... hopefully putting this century-long prohibition behind us.</p>

<p>Personally <em>I</em> don&#39;t &#39;smoke&#39; ... opium? may change things, but it seems &#39;easy enough to get away with&#39; if I were so inclined... i&#39;m not. and pills and other forms are just as easy to get ahold of vs building an addiction across a wide-range of opiate-types, vs the specific ones of codeine, morphine, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>part II of that &#39;wall o&#39; text&#39;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Which leads me to.... &#39;class of drug&#39;. Meth is seemingly the most addictive and destructive drug out there, crack behind it... but heroin and/or opiates very close behind that and arguably tied with crack... coke alcohol, etc falling behind, and ... well, then there&#39;s obviously nicotine but it&#39;s a bit different on the &#39;mind altering&#39; aspects of it ... read: i&#39;ve never thought twice about smoking a cigarette in front of a cop, where the others on the list..... even the legal drinking.. usually has me waiting until they &#39;pass by&#39;.</p>

<p>point is.. the one thing I liked about Portugal&#39;s approach is similar to accidents on the Audubon .. against popular belief, there is actually very little of the audubon that is &#39;speed limit&#39;less&#39; ... and, obviously there are car accidents in europe... but, with the audubon being what it is, and esp with the speed being a bit more liberal... (fines are drastically increased, which sort of plays into the overall arch of what i&#39;m going to say, but not the emphasis with this analogy)... the road seems to &#39;self regulate&#39; ... meaning, people don&#39;t want to get hit by a car going 100-150mph... so they get the hell out of the way... but, even more so than just-personal selfishness or fear.. there also seems to be a respect that isn&#39;t here relative to that... at least not on the same level (is it here).  .... but, also... beyond &#39;respect&#39;... ..and fear... there seems to be less accidents too... but, when there <em>are</em> accidents, they tend to be pretty freakin&#39; bad.</p>

<p>The same seems to be the case with how Portugal polices drugs.... basically, they don&#39;t. ... until there&#39;s reason to.   ... but when there is, they come down hard on the perp committing the crime.   So, lets say I get into a fight... i get arrested, I get a 3 month sentence out of a possible maximum of 5 months. but, rewind &amp; redo... lets say I get in a fight... but I&#39;m drunk. Now I don&#39;t just get 3 months out of a possibly 5 month maximum sentence... the maximum sentence rises up to 6 months... and I get sentenced <em>to</em> all six.   ..and, I have to do mandatory b.s. alcohol classes while there... sort of like crap court ordered classes here.  but... if i do the optional alcohol classes while <em>also</em> in jail, my sentence gets reduced.  so, instead of the mandatory &#39;once a week&#39; i now do the optional 3x a week or 5x a week or whatever... my sentence gets reduced respectively.  The same seems to be said about their &#39;anger management&#39; classes.. that may <em>also</em> be attended... regardless of drunk or sober... relative to &#39;public brawling&#39;.</p>

<p>point is... as i take the classes, my sentence gets reduced... from 6 months down to 4 months... gotta make it sting a bit vs fully erasing a substance&#39;s involvement altogether... but... because I <em>also</em> do the &#39;anger management&#39; classes, my &#39;fighting alone&#39; portion gets reduced as well.. by a month.... so, now the overall sentence is reduced... to 3 months .... vs, if no alcohol had been involved, i&#39;d get out in 2 with the optional anger management classes....</p>

<p>...but, there&#39;s also something to note about these &#39;optional&#39; classes.   ...they&#39;re &#39;optional&#39; ... so, their &#39;quality&#39; changes.  vs being some mandatory throw the book at me deal where i&#39;m taught a bunch of random in one ear out the other crap... these optional ones I have to <em>want</em> to do.. and actually ... or at least seemingly... <em>want</em> to get better...   ...and, with that, <em>that&#39;s</em> the most fascinating part.  the people that get into these &#39;optional programs&#39;? whether actually crime-related or not? do better.... such as to say... sure drinking may still be done, and sure it may still &#39;cause some problems&#39;.. but, overall, this &#39;experiment&#39; really seems to imply a desire to get better ...and, even better than that... an actual genuine success with it... whereby... even <em>with</em> the legalization of drugs... there&#39;s actually been an overall <em>de</em>crease in the amount of drugs consumed overall... throughout the entire country.</p>

<p>...almost as if to imply that the laws themselves, and the entire authoritarian approach seemed to really &#39;stress people the fuck out&#39; ...... obviously it&#39;s just a &#39;few years into it&#39; ... and tings may change.. </p>

<p>which brings me to the next level...</p>

<p>now lets say it was brawling, alcohol... <em>and</em> cocaine involved.... 3 months not just jumps to 6, but 6 months jumps to 12 or even more... ie, the audubon car accident analogy... there may be less cases, but when you <em>do</em> get caught... you get hammered.   ...the same shit applies... and, with less people tied up in the criminal system, the criminal system really has a lot more time and energy to focus on and isolate out individual prisoners... truly trying to figure out what&#39;s wrong and taking an actual genuine solution approach towards helping to heal the prisoner (/ pseudo-patient) and actually genuinely truly effectively &#39;rehabilitating&#39; them vs just locking them up for a while and then rereleasing them into the wild with an &#39;at-prisoner-expense&#39; ankle bracelet... and rules designed to otherwise just lead them right back into a life of crime then jail.</p>

<p>side note: probation works the same way. obv &#39;jail time&#39; for a &#39;public fight&#39; may be a bit harsh... or, rather &#39;prison time&#39;... getting locked up in &#39;<em>jail</em>&#39; may happen and make sense, but upping it from &#39;jail time&#39; pre-court to &#39;prison time&#39; post-sentencing is a bit severe for &#39;public brawling&#39; ... it&#39;s just an example.</p>

<p>that being said.. while on probation, sentence terms (to probation) can be reduced in time periods as well if optional classes / therapy are sought... parole / probation ... whatever, you get the idea.</p>

<p>Thus, the &#39;classification&#39; of the drugs.. the scheduling / class structure of the drugs still applies... but only where it overlaps with <em>other</em> crimes first.</p>

<p>another / better example would be: steal a car... vs stealing a car while coked up.  both land you a prison sentence, but the second a longer one and &#39;harsher treatment&#39;</p>

<p>The basic concept could&#39;ve been explained in less words, I feel but... overall, the idea is that &#39;drugs are legal&#39;, quality will increase, availability may need to remain a bit stricter... like.. a pharmacy vs a coffee shop or corner liquor store... but, overall, a general feeling of <em>not</em> living in a police state would be nice.</p>

<p>Backing out of all of that... I have one thing I&#39;m still watching for relative to it all... and, it&#39;s obviously something that&#39;s been addressed already, but I&#39;m curious the longer term ramifications of it... and that is... addiction. Some of these substances... a lot of them in fact... are <em>extremely</em> addictive. Meth is horribly so. Alcohol &amp; opiates are arguably addictions you <em>never</em> recover from... and can and almost always usually do flare up again... and oftentimes even <em>worse</em> than they were before.  ...kind of like a prisoner coming home, doing good for a while, really turning things around, but... eventually... going back to it simply because &#39;old habits die hard&#39;</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m more a libertarian of sort... which <em>I</em> interpret to generally lean towards being <em>more</em> conservative than &#39;the conservatives&#39; and even <em>more</em> &#39;liberal&#39; than &#39;the liberals&#39; ... with a sort of mix and twist of my own thrown into the whole shebang.</p>

<p>Overall though, I think that even the medical and psychological/physiological components can be worked out... maybe not with (mental) therapy alone, but.. as science progresses, and as less and less people are tied up in jail and/or fear.. and are allowed to explore what the OP was going with... and &#39;opening their minds&#39; to &#39;new ways of doing things&#39;... solutions to much of the biological limitations may <em>also</em> be able to be discovered... relative to biological addiction to heroin, alcohol, meth, etc.</p>

<p>But, also, going with OP&#39;s line of thought relative to psychoactive drugs (LSD, shrooms, etc).. these don&#39;t seem heavily abused.... not the same way.  ..they seem much more &#39;recreational&#39; in their usage patterns... if... IF... something can be &#39;figured out&#39; relative to the other drugs that <em>are</em> more prone to addiction... maybe they <em>too</em> can become more casually recreational? and, thus, more socially acceptable?  Maybe I&#39;m not just being an idealist... but, at least one that&#39;s hopefully that a &#39;cure&#39; can be <em>found</em> rather than one who assumes that one already has... in the form of more government regulation, intervention, and... ultimately.. &#39;handouts&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr: just read the part between the two lines</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol, again, I read the whole thing, thank you for the links. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s late and I don&#39;t have the ability to leave a message half finished like you do, that made me chuckle, but I&#39;m still not motivated enough to respond line by line so I&#39;ll give a summary.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll get not arguments from me about larger nations needing legalization. And those results do sound promising. You make the strongest anti-Prohibition arguments I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally I don&#39;t &#39;smoke&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve quit doing illegal drugs, not entirely to my enjoyment, and it may not necessarily be a permanent decision. I may want to experiment more in my life.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Responding to your second:</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>a general feeling of not living in a police state would be nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarize my response to the above section, it sounds like Portugal does have the right idea. And I think I get the Audubon analogy. I think those policies are reasonable considering the benefit in the long run.</p>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>addiction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, here is where I should have personal experience, it&#39;s something I take seriously. It is generally a problem in my life, though I&#39;m fortunate enough to not hold any dependance on the most severe of substances, it&#39;s still something I don&#39;t need.</p>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall though</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Especially as science improves, I think we will find better ways to treat addictions and perhaps the solve the root of the cause entirely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OP&#39;s line of thought ...  if... IF... something can be &#39;figured out&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something that not only fascinates me but also startles me with this concept is the fact that some of the most intelligent individuals have not only experimented with such substances, but are also the chemists who made them. Like Albert Hoffman, Alexander Shulgin etc.. I feel that once mankind moves beyond it&#39;s general fear of the unknown, once we evolve to the next step mentally, it will be with the assistance of chemicals that alter brain chemistry in ways we cannot even imagine.</p>

<p>To reinforce this notion:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That argument <em>may</em> have validity amongst the most minute of enforcement circles and mindsets, but there are many many other reasons or &#39;logics&#39; for why the powers that be would make psychedelic drugs &#39;restricted&#39;.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other things that are capable of &#39;opening ones mind&#39; to status quo disrupting perspectives and approaches ... Just look at the early US responses to communism from back in the earlier days of the 20th century, or banned books, etc.</p>

<p>I will definitely buy into the idea of those in control wanting to not have their control undermined or questioned, as well people in general not wanting to deal with people that are of &#39;questionable sobriety&#39; or that don&#39;t conform as easily to preestablished structures or models...just look at the various ways civilization has dealt with its &#39;(mentally) handicapped&#39; throughout even the past century, let alone the dozens before it... but, maybe also because people that are on them tend to be a greater danger to not just themselves but to others as well. Have you never had a conversation with someone on acid? ...that&#39;s insistent on  driving?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>to be fair, <a href="/u/Vailhem">/u/Vailhem</a> wasn&#39;t drawing comparisons to booze or anything, just saying people on acid can be a fucking liability. Which is an absolute truth....</p>

<p>I&#39;m an absolute advocate for full drug legalisation across the board, but I accept some of those drugs make us incapable or potentially dangerous.</p>

<p>The fact we can absorb that impact from alcohol (arguably one of the most dangerous and problem causing drugs out there) only proves we can probably cope with trippers and ravers and junkies without it causing too much trouble....</p>

<p>I mean, aside from a raging PCP lunatic I&#39;d sooner cope with anyone on any drug aside from alcohol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree man, I think the entire argument is <em>far</em> more nuanced than &#39;govt. hates free thought, that&#39;s why they condemn psychedelics&#39;, but I do think that doorways to perception can sorta be opened and I do think psychedelics have massive social value (personal value too!).</p>

<p>But once again, that isn&#39;t saying we should brew shroom tea for breakfast everyday!</p>

<p>I think if anything, the hippy movement and that fucked up hive of activity where Zappa hung out and the mamas and the papas and joplin and crosby and nash and Charles fucking Manson, and where <em>all</em> those people died. If that proved anything, it proves that people on lots of acid are pretty easy to manipulate and motivate to do your bidding.</p>

<p>Something curious, rebellious and hubris filled psychonauts should bear in mind!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Defending illegal activity is dumb&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Psychedelics are so good and I&#39;m so smart for using then I don&#39;t associate with people who haven&#39;t. But illegal stuff is wrong!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The govt doesn&#39;t spy for our protection, they&#39;re trying to arrest us all!&quot; </p>

<p>You&#39;d make a funny tv show character, always whining and throwing a tantrum over something you don&#39;t know anything about. Go take some more shrooms and tell everyone how amazing they were for the 100th time, everybody is super impressed. You&#39;re so smart for worrying about this stuff when everyone isn&#39;t, they&#39;re just ignorant. They&#39;re just dumb, not you! Keep on goin you! Hahahahahahahahahaha </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is really dependant on the surroundings and your frame of mind. </p>

<p>Ive done liberty caps which grow in the northern hemisphere a couple of times in the last 10 years. I found the experience soul refreshing ; something akin to a reboot. Maybe im being romantic but I experienced a chil d like wonder and intrerest in the world. I think mushrooms maybe act as an prepatory antidepressant . They appear in autumn and prepare you forvthe winter perhaps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A reboot is kind of how I&#39;d explain it too. Particularly, as over the years likewise, my trips (at least mushy ones) have tended to be seasonal and somewhat spontaneous - that even if not necesarily the experience itself which can be varied from amusing, insightful, confusing, spiritual, boring, or terrifying or all at once....it&#39;s the feeling the day after which is curious, it really feels like you&#39;e done a system cleanup, deleted your .temp files and defragged your hard drive. A seriously pleasant, chilled out and not like &#39;binge-crash&#39; drug effect, temporary type feeling. It&#39;s a lasting effect. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good to hear that someone else is on the same sort of page. I get what you are saying about the aftermath. Drink, speed, cocaine, ecstacy anything like that leaves you like shit afterwards. It&#39;s almost the opposite with mushrooms. Like you&#39;ve been cleansed rather than poisened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I can say is that, I&#39;ve done shrooms thousands of times, but when I first smoked Salvia, it was the first time I questioned my reality, which was mildly frightening at first, but long after and many trips later it was actually a very relaxing feeling, based on the philosophy it is hard to explain.</p>

<p>I became introduced to all manner of ideologies, as I was a Christian-turned Atheist most of my life, but I would say the original trip and &quot;research&quot; eventually &quot;converted&quot; me to Agnostic, I began to doubt my certainty in <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>Then I cut back on usage of those drugs. I think the lasting after affects, and being introduced to social media bolstered my view on politics. Since I&#39;ve lived in a shithole my entire life there really isn&#39;t much to do. And that&#39;s pretty much my experience.</p>

<p>That said though, you do make a good point. Nobody should post in this thread unless they appreciate it&#39;s contents are officially &#39;on record&#39;.</p>

<p>Welcome to the internet :/ :D</p>
