<p>It really is a matter of semantics but I wish most of you accusing everyone else of &quot;blasphemies against mankind&quot; realize that YOU PERSONALLY are degrading an official world over religion who willingly and gladly pays taxes to each nation they are a part of. Please stop using words and phrases you are seemingly ignorant of. Satanist have no other agenda other than personal happiness through whatever means. True satanists are individualist and do not need much more than food, shelter, love, and a little mystery.</p>

<p>How much of that is genuine and how much of that is reactive or &#39;playing on a meme&#39; is up for debate, but both the history of presidency in the US and the history of pop culture is soaked in this weird occultism that I have no idea how to parse, aside from thinking it&#39;s weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For proof that those in control are satanists, Freemasons, Illuminati, Jesuit, Rosicul ect..</p>

<p>Go to Google maps and look at the street layout above the white house. Its a pentagram, and the supreme council of Freemasonry is right on top of it where baphomet&#39;s torch would be. Learn about Egyptian symbolism about the obelisk and reflecting pool, the bohemian owl around the state house. All the symbolism is there, and a lot of other places, like where JFK was ritually murdered. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to believe what the religion they do, but that doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t in control.</p>

<p>If your interested in learning about them, I would read Albert Pikes (very famous Freemason) &quot;Morals and Dogma of the free and accepted Scottish Rite&quot;, the kaballah, &quot;The book of the law&quot; by Aleister Crawly. You&#39;ll find out a lot from those to start. I&#39;m currently looking for a good Egyptian story and hieroglyph meaning. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The irony.. considering I happen to have read LaVey&#39;s Satanic Bible, LaVey&#39;s Satanic Rituals, Aquino&#39;s Setian &#39;Church of Satan&#39; book, Barret&#39;s &#39;The Magus&#39;, among various works on Luciferianism and goetia, among dozens of other grimoires and works of an occult or esoteric nature. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are already completely over zealous in their own ( or programmed ) religious beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an agnostic pantheist, who was an atheist prior to that since age 12, and raised a Catholic until I had enough common sense to realize organized religion is a farce, I find that statement laughable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using it for a shock factor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what would anyone here have to gain from that? I can&#39;t think of any conceivable way that would work to one&#39;s advantage or what anyone would gain from doing so, other than potential further ridicule from those who are equally dismissive of such claims without researching them, such as yourself (OP). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mean elite secularists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If, by &quot;secularists&quot;, you truly mean the Luciferian elite who have been prominent among the American and European banking dynasties and aristocracy for centuries, albeit in secret (and for good reason), certain secular Satanist groups (i.e. Church of Satan and mainstream satanism, which is a joke at best), and more curious: theistic Satanist groups as with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Order_of_Nine_Angles#cite_note-33">Order of Nine Angles</a>, not to mention the mainstream faux-Christian religious groups who have been infiltrated by closeted Luciferians (the Vatican, Mormons, etc.), the closeted Luciferians hiding among the higher degrees of Freemasonry, the LHP (left-hand path) Thelemites of the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis), then sure. </p>

<p>Perhaps specifically, those who created the phrase: <em>Novus Ordo Seclorum</em>, which literally translates to <em>&quot;New Secular Order&quot;</em> but has also been interpreted as <em>&quot;New Word Order&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;New Order</em> (or <em>New Secular Order</em>) <em>of the Ages&quot;</em> whose goal (since 1776) has in part been to establish a system of global governance / dominance, to destroy the old world&#39;s monarchs and systematically subvert the democracies that replaced them since they had fomented the first revolution of its type in France via proxy with the <em>hidden hand</em> of their <em>Grand Orient</em> lodges, to establish a system of authoritarian plutocratic oligarchy under the guise of freedom and democracy for the masses, to gradually abolish the world&#39;s Abrahamic religions (Islam, Christianity &amp; finally Judaism), replacing the <em>Old World Order</em> or old world theocracy with a supposedly secular society that under cloak of darkness embraces the esoteric, occult and Luciferian doctrines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it not plausible that the founding fathers who many of which were Freemasons found this symbolism inspiring? Is it a pentagram of an inverted pentagram (that used by Satanists) a pentagram is an ancient symbol used by the pythagoreans (i believe) to represent the four elements of nature and the fifth of spirit. Satanists inverted the pentagram to disgrace the holy trinity and uphold the duality of mankind. I feel less qualified in addressing your other issues and will do some research.</p>

<p>Edit: I believe the owl has been used for a very long time as a symbol of wisdom which is akin to enlightenment. Symbolism to my eyes and mind is not proof. Things like Monsantos ceo/pres working for the government now is PROOF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He mentions the powerful ability in which the traditional SYMBOL of Lucifer has over the human intelligence. To claim Freemasons worship Lucifer may be another story, the last time I checked most Freemasons demand only that you believe in a creator, however it seems predominated by Christianity, not Satanism. And that is indeed why the Baphomet has a torch, it is merely a symbol for you to use, as a tool, towards your own enlightenment and search for truth and happiness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone interested in this topic needs to see the work of Ted Gunderson: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EBowBPwNW4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EBowBPwNW4</a></p>

<p>He served as head of the FBI in Memphis, Dallas, and LA.  Relevant excerpt from his wiki :  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a 1995 conference in Dallas, Gunderson warned about the proliferation of secret Satanic groups, and the danger posed by the New World Order, a shadow government that would be controlling the US government.[9] He also claimed that a &quot;slave auction&quot; in which children were sold to men in turbans had been held in Las Vegas, that four thousand ritual human sacrifices are performed in New York City every year, and that the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was carried out by the US government.[9] Gunderson believed that in the US there is a secret widespread network of groups who kidnap children and infants, and subject them to Satanic ritual abuse and subsequent human sacrifice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s a huge part of their system of control. The Satanic initiation ritual serves a gatekeeping function -- keeps all people with any sort of conscience locked out. And it is perfect blackmail material -- do as we say or we&#39;ll release video of you raping a little kid.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about total control.</p>

<p>Not for the faint of heart:

    <div class="md"><p>You have obviously read none of the aforementioned comments related to this discussion? Satanic Panic 1980&#39;s Google it.
Satanic Initiation? The only officially recognized group of Satanists is the school founded and a direct descendant of that made famous by Anton LaVey has an initiation. It&#39;s costs you $200.00 USD on their website and can be revoked at ANY TIME for ANY REASON.</p>

<p>I certainly do not agree with any form of violence that is not warranted by self defense. Things such as child rape, trafficking, rape and murder are vile aspects of the human condition. Using the term Satanic to mean inhuman acts perpetrated by humans is likes me calling every single kind-hearted act an act of God.</p>

<p>EDIT: Most of these &quot;Satanic&quot; acts are conducted by perverse theistic hooligans trying to appease some devil of this or that cause. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are numerous types of Satanic rituals and I cannot with 100% certainty that this may not be some sort of improvised ritual. I can however say that ritual is a very private purging of emotions. I wouldn&#39;t be doing my Satanic duties if I gave away all of the tid-bits to ye now would I? A quick google of either The Satanic Bible of Satanic Rituals (LaVey)  and a visit to their website can help you gain an understanding of some of the more common types of ritual.</p>

<p>Edit: My personal opinion of this &quot;Satanic Ritual&quot; is just like any other major religion, it is an organized event designed to elicit a particular state of mind of effect.</p>

<p>What&#39;s that mean? Satan wrote a manifesto?</p>

<p>True satanists are individualist and do not need much more than food, shelter, love, and a little mystery.</p>

<p>This is your problem. Satanism existed long before LaVey and all the other posers co-opted the word. Real satanism is anti-human. If you want to make up some other religion (which you have), then you should find a new name to call yourselves. You wouldn&#39;t make a New Age cult and call it Church of Jesus, would you?</p>

<p>All I am asking is that if you are willing to subscribe to circumstantial evidence and suddenly claim is it PROOF of this or that theory would it not behoove yourself and other you are trying to enlighten with actual first hand information? I do not deny the myriad of links between corporate America and secret societies, not one bit. But to bring another completely unrelated religion into the game because it sounds bad or you personally do not believe in it&#39;s philosophy does not automatically make it part of your universal conspiracy.</p>
