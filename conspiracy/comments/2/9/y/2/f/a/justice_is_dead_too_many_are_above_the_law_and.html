        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s my opinion that there are numerous wealthy and powerful individuals that are sick individuals, above the law, and possibly are part of an interconnected group/organization. Their actions range from pedophilia, murder (assassinations), bribery, blackmailing, economic exploitation, and plenty of other crimes. The wealth, power, and connections these individuals have essentially made them above the law. A lot of people in this world, particularity in the US, are simply untouchable. I see this as a huge problem facing our society today, our courts and various petty laws have become a tool used to keep the poor and unfortunate oppressed. Individual freedoms have been limited by said petty laws, so has our bank accounts from ludicrous amounts of fines/taxes. Justice should be applied to everybody equally, and when it doesn&#39;t, it creates a mockery out of our laws. Or more accurately, it creates a system of oppression for those who have no influence over world affairs. That&#39;s how it seems to be, at least by my perception.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t real justice anymore; the lower class is fined/jailed via petty laws, while corrupt persons are generally protected from their crimes, even when it&#39;s against humanity. Cops shoot unarmed men, and almost always their trail is a farce; leading to just a paid vacation. People with power get away with all sorts of crimes, way more than we are aware of. People, or groups, continuously getting away with their crimes is one of the reasons we have a poor economy and infrastructure here in America, presumably. I find it appalling that corrupt bankers, stockbrokers, and corporations can so easily exploit both the working class and the economy continuously; extensively rigging it in their favor, breaking numerous laws in the process, yet they receive no punishment. No new regulations, no oversight, nothing is done to prevent it and solve a real problem. Instead, they get bailed out with our money; even though they&#39;ve been stealing it for years. To be fair, sometimes they&#39;ll be fined a minute amount but it doesn&#39;t put a dent in them. Overall, I&#39;d say most of them are never caught, and maybe some aren&#39;t supposed to be. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been alive for 21 years, in that time I&#39;ve seen an astounding amount of horrible, guilty people set free and given special privileges; all because they had money, power and connections. That&#39;s crooked justice. Lady Justice has no blindfold. None of those politicians are going to be given a proper trial, if any at all. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to hear what some of your opinions are on the current state of justice here in America, or wherever really. Not just justice, but the laws we have, the ones who break them without consequence and the affect on society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a bit of a different take on it. </p>

<p>People think that the rich are untouchable, but that&#39;s not true. It&#39;s not so much the rich as it is those essential to the system, those who control the levers of power. </p>

<p>You see, a guy like Bernie Madoff breaks the law and he goes to jail for life. But a guy like Ben Bernanke breaks the law and he&#39;s rewarded with $250,000 speech opportunities at Goldman Sachs. If you attack a wedding and kill everyone there you get the death penalty (rightly so), whereas Obama drops a bomb an innocent people attending a wedding, nothing happens. </p>

<p>The rich are only immune to the level to which they are integral to the system of current power... whether it be through the contributions they give, or if they employ enough people (ie. impact on the economy), or if they have something the gov wants (weapons of war or ability to tap into users internet data). </p>

<p>Edward snowden breaks the law and he&#39;s facing life in prison. James Clapper lies before congress and nothing happens (he should have got 5 years in prison for that). The difference is Clapper is part of the system of power, whereas snowden wasn&#39;t. </p>

<p>So the laws still apply to 99% of the population, they just don&#39;t apply anymore to the 1% (but that 1% is not always &quot;rich&quot;... there are some folks who aren&#39;t rich yet hold positions of power and they too are untouchable). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, and share most of your opinion. Like you said, the system is manipulated to benefit itself and those who serve it well. On the flip side, it is also used to prosecute those who threaten it, cross it, or do not meet it&#39;s needs. </p>

<p>I do believe there&#39;s some exception to that rule however. People with millions, and the right connections, have a get out of jail free card as well sometimes, even if they&#39;re not an important part of the system. When you have money like that, you have a lot more options at your disposal than others to get out of some crimes, or if convicted make the sentence and punishment laughable. A rich individual is also going to have access to some great, and likely corrupted/connected, lawyers and legal teams which can likely win them a trial or prevent one. Bribery is of course another option for the rich to utilize, which surely they do. This is all presumptions on my part, but it should be close to the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh for sure... if you are rich you definitely have a better chance of getting off simply due to having better lawyers. </p>

<p>The real problem we&#39;ve got now is that criminality is now expected of people. You cannot be a politician if you aren&#39;t willing to take bribes. You can&#39;t run a Fortune 500 company if you aren&#39;t willing to take advantage of slave labor. You can&#39;t be in the military if you aren&#39;t willing to wage war on countries for no reason other than imperial expansion. </p>

<p>It&#39;s basically like a cancer, it keeps spreading and multiplying until its infected everything. </p>

<p>And just like cancer, the earlier you catch it and treat it, the better your odds of beating it. The first opportunity to fix it was in 2001 with the tech bubble meltdown... but instead of fixing it they creating the housing bubble (which led to the 2008 crash). Similarly in 2001 was 9/11, which should have just been a simple round up bin laden and his group and kill them, but instead led to 13+ years of war. </p>

<p>So really since 2001 we&#39;ve had this cancer that has grown and grown and no one has treated it but rather made it worse. </p>

<p>Personally I think the patient is now terminal. This is so broken and so corrupt that I don&#39;t think you can fix it any longer. All that&#39;s left is for the country to rot away and eventually die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true, proper ethics have vanished from Governments, banks, and corporations. I find our current state of Capitalism to be a cancer of it&#39;s own. For the giant corporations, the bottom line is expanding profit margin which is why they bribe politicians, use slave labor, treat employees like shit and generally cut all corners possible no matter what the affect may be to society, Government and the economy. I believe those problems originated from improper regulation, and by giving Corporations too many legal rights. That&#39;s a whole other topic though.</p>

<p>The Government also has a cancer, like you said. The military is focusing on gaining as much control as they can get away with, much like a toleration Government. They&#39;re ruthless and use whatever methods at their disposal to accomplish objectives, which are generally aimed towards more control; including exploitation of foreigners, and we the citizens. Sending young kids to war for profit/power, using Hollywood and propaganda to brainwash the masses, and slowly stripping away our constitutional rights are all serious effects from that cancer. They, like those giant corporations, are above the law. Then again, they basically are the law. </p>

<p>I find cancer to be a proper analogy, and it certainly has spread everywhere. Where I do disagree with you however is in regards to the patient being terminally ill. I&#39;ll never give up on what this country should and could be, and I&#39;ll always believe there&#39;s a way to fix the corruption. The way I see it, the best way to rid Capitalism and our Government of this cancer would be reform. More regulations intended to protect people&#39;s rights, more oversight to prevent corruption from being as prevalent, and a better modernized constitution written with the original in mind. I think that last bit about a better constitution is important, because America has changed vastly over the years so we need a clearer and more inclusive constitution. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all idealism though, I know that. It would be incredibly difficult to achieve any of those goals, but what I&#39;m trying to show is that it&#39;s theoretically possible to cure that cancer we&#39;ve got so bad. </p>

<p>I hate saying this but they now control pretty much everything. </p>

<p>They control the economy through the banks and the fed. They control the police and military. They control the internet or at least can spy on everything you do or say on it. 
And they control the political landscape. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I hope you are right but I personally think the corruption is so pervasive that there&#39;s no fixing it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A sentiment felt by many others throughout history, and some have found a way to temporally fix it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Short of a million people storming the white house and congress and throwing the bums out nothing is going to change. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way I see it, there&#39;s two ways to change. One is through fear, by making them afraid of we the people, we can take back control. The second one is through an organized collective protest/strike aimed at damaging unjust parts of the system without any violence. I&#39;m hoping we&#39;ll one day have that huge protest. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t see where a genuine challenge to their control is going to come from </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one thing they can never fully control is people. They can brainwash them, and make them believe in falsehoods, but they can&#39;t ever keep them from finding their own independence. That&#39;s where the genuine challenge comes from; from people realizing things are not quite what they seem. They say at a certain point an idea spreads like wildfire throughout entire populations; maybe it&#39;ll happen and we&#39;ll live to see and participate in this country&#39;s best hope. Who knows really, but always have hope man. If you lose that hope, and truly believe they are unstoppable, they have won. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way i see it is the people have more power. If we all said FUCK YOU, I REFUSE TO WORK then it would ALL come to a stop.
We need to pry the power from the Bankers. Remember that ditch your bank day a few years back when people closed their bank accounts in favor of credit unions?
Well, here&#39;s my idea. We set up this new system of banks. Banks where the profit goes back to the community. Each pool of money is themed, say like one is for farmers. Lots of farmers&#39; money is pooled, and much of the profits from this mass pooling goes back to the farmers. So it serves the people who invest in it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious what we&#39;d like to do about it, or most of us I assume, but it&#39;s not currently practical. So while we cannot start a political movement and change the laws and system right now, we can still talk and learn about it. </p>

<p>&quot;This charge refers to the fact that several of the colonies had been obliged from their establishment to submit their laws to the King for his approval. This power, the Declaration implies, was never consistent with the fundamental principle of just government: consent.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the corruption is due to everything becoming a business.  It&#39;s not just our justice system, but pretty much everything.  For example; Child Protection Services needs to accomplish something in order to constitute funding, so they will pick on a poor family that can&#39;t afford a decent lawyer, and come up with some excuse to take their children away.  They do this just to continue getting funded, so they can keep their jobs.</p>

<p>Another example; our police are no longer interested in peace.  In fact, peace is the last thing they want, because they also need to accomplish something to constitute funding, which means making arrests.  Making an arrest is the most important thing to them.</p>

<p>Our teachers no longer care about educating their students.  All they care about is conditioning people into accepting and regurgitating whatever is told to them, and if they can&#39;t or won&#39;t, then the student is ridiculed, made an example of, and failed.  Even if the information is proven to be wrong, the teacher only cares about being respected as an authority figure.</p>

<p>It&#39;s everywhere.  How could this happen?  How in the world did we let it get this insane?  Because we allowed sociopaths to rise to levels where they gained the power to make these changes.  A sociopath sees this world like a playground, and they want to play too, but they can&#39;t play like the other kids, so they instead force the other kids to play like they do.  This way, they appear to be the normal ones.  They appear to be functional and rational.  The truth is, and they know this, they are far from rational or normal.  They&#39;re freaks, and there&#39;s only a few of them.</p>

<p>How do they get in power?  They lie.  They cheat.  They manipulate.   </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of that before, but it&#39;s believable. Do you happen to have something I could read up on?</p>

<p>I agree about the police, it&#39;s mainly about arrests. They have other serious problems though.</p>

<p>Education here is horrible, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really the teacher&#39;s fault. They&#39;re like puppets for the most part, following a state&#39;s education agenda. Quite a few of the teachers I knew thought the education system was bullshit. That a lot of what was taught isn&#39;t important for children to learn. Even counter-productive to a child&#39;s development, in certain regards. </p>

<p>This one down to earth global politics teacher I had used to tell me that education today is intended to keep children from questioning and being objective, to submit to what the Government deems important; never teaching them what&#39;s truly important. I learned a lot at a young age from that guy. Education could be a lot better if ever reformed, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s meant to keep us dumb and brainwashed. </p>

<p>I agree fully with you last few paragraphs. We supported it, and were mostly complacent. Our lives are played as if it were a game of chess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing to keep in mind is CPS has become a multi-billion dollar industry.  Case workers, social workers, judges, lawyers, psychiatrists, therapists, counselors, foster parents, adoptive parents, everyone&#39;s involved and stands to lose their paycheck unless they manipulate the system to take as many kids away from their parents as they can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a difficult thing to wrap your head around, because it&#39;s such a horrible concept.  Also, the people being targeted are typically poor and uneducated.  They also tend to ignore the really bad cases, because those cases tend to be too difficult and take up too much of their time.  Besides, if the parent kills the kid, the media will explode the story to make people think we need MORE CPS, but we rarely ever hear about the many more death and abuse from foster parents, because that would make CPS look bad.</p>

<p>Let alone the number of kids that simply disappear.  It happens all the time.  They take away a person&#39;s parental rights, hand the kid to some stranger, and <em>poof</em>, the kid just &quot;disappears&quot;.  It&#39;s suspected that there might be some involvement in human trafficking, but there&#39;s no direct link discovered as of yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the most important factors in a democracy is rule of law. If certain classes, certain groups, are above the law, it creates a climate of disrespect and resentment and tends to break down the entire system. People see their leaders getting away with crimes and ask themselves why they are obeying the law. They start to think that the only justice is vigilante justice. A true free society must have a rule of law that is equal for everyone, regardless of social status or wealth. That has been lost in America. There is no longer even the polite fiction that the law applies to everyone equally. If it did, Obama and his advisors would be in prison.</p>

<p>&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness, That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.

<p>Child Protection Services needs to accomplish something in order to constitute funding, so they will pick on a poor family that can&#39;t afford a decent lawyer, and come up with some excuse to take their children away</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of that before, but it&#39;s believable. Do you happen to have something I could read up on?</p>

<p>I agree about the police, it&#39;s mainly about arrests. They have other serious problems though.</p>

<p>Education here is horrible, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really the teacher&#39;s fault. They&#39;re like puppets for the most part, following a state&#39;s education agenda. Quite a few of the teachers I knew thought the education system was bullshit. That a lot of what was taught isn&#39;t important for children to learn. Even counter-productive to a child&#39;s development, in certain regards. </p>

<p>This one down to earth global politics teacher I had used to tell me that education today is intended to keep children from questioning and being objective, to submit to what the Government deems important; never teaching them what&#39;s truly important. I learned a lot at a young age from that guy. Education could be a lot better if ever reformed, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s meant to keep us dumb and brainwashed. </p>

<p>I agree fully with you last few paragraphs. We supported it, and were mostly complacent. Our lives are played as if it were a game of chess. </p>
