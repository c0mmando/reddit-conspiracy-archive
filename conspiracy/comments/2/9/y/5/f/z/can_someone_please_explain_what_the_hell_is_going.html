       It started several months ago mostly because of a massive misunderstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Obama administration decided that children, brought here by their parents, will be allowed to stay in the United States legally.  Under the new rules children that we brought here prior to 2010 without a criminal record can stay legally.
      </p>
      <p>
       In central American countries though, this was announced as "bring your kids to America and they'll be allowed to stay."  Which is incorrect.  It was likely a mixture of actual misunderstanding and smuggling organizations intentionally misleading people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So anyway, this cased a massive influx of aliens into south Texas.  The numbers are so great that it's forcing us to release them anyway because we simply don't have the resources to hold them all.  Everyone has the right to plead their case to a judge and we just don't have anywhere near the number of immigration judges to hold everyone in custody until their court date.  So they're released with a pending court date which, of course, they will never go to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, because so many people erroneously believed that they would be allowed to stay they are probably going to be allowed to stay anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
       The asylum thing isn't really relevant.  None of them (or at least very few) are seriously claiming asylum.

       It's really not that difficult or expensive to travel that far.  They just spend a few weeks on buses.  Mexico is offering 30 day visas for travelers just passing through.

       No, Mexico is NOT offering 30 day visas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most they can receive is a 45 day notice that they can return to their appointment for their refugee status interviews and are only allowed to be within the state that they applied for asylum. This applies to every country that ratified the international refugee conventions, which is most of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the tactic is to apply for this interview and use the notice to attempt to make it to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_tren_de_la_muerte">
        The Beast

       , from there they go up north. But, they're hounded the entire way. Extortion, bribery, blackmail, rape, death, prostitution. Kind of like a continuous Trail of Tears.

       Another interesting fact, the recent appointee to head the Instituto Nacional de Migracion (Immigration Department) is a hard head who has turned immigration processing centers into detention facilities. He's actually a

       Crossing illegally, barring certain specific circumstances, is an administrative crime akin to getting a traffic ticket.  it would be misleading to call a guy with a speeding a criminal.  Crossing illegally is the same.

       While in the US for 11 months I received two traffic violation tickets totaling nearly $500.  I had to sign a piece of paper to not be sent to jail and then my "bail" amount came in the mail.  I sure felt like a criminal but I'm glad that you don't see it that way.  Currently I'm living in Europe and so keeping my self clean in America.

        'Brown shirts' threaten medical staff with arrest if they talk about immigrants

       <p>
        A government-contracted security force calling itself the "Brown Shirts" have threatened to arrest doctors and nurses if they say anything about contagious diseases at a refugee camp for illegal immigrants set up at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, Todd Starnes reported at Fox News on Wednesday.

       The illness concerns are mostly overblown.   Many of them have scabies which is a minor skin condition that can be cleared up pretty quick.  A few of them have more major diseases but everyone is medically screened.

       They're being housed in various military bases and holding facilities around the country.   It doesn't matter if it "makes sense."  Every single person on US soil is constitutionally entitled to due process under the law.  They must be held somewhere or released pending a court date. This is not negotiable.

       I don't see any positives for the Obama administration from this.  This surge has guaranteed that no immigration reform will pass any time soon.  I don't see why the left would plan this.

       We're being overwhelmed.   We have to many in custody to hold them until their court date so we have to release most of them and give them a day to show up in court which they'll never go to.  Then they call all their friend and family in their home country and tell them they were allowed to stay in the US which just brings even more people.

       The solicitation for escorts for up to 65,000 UACs several months ago would indicate otherwise. I hope by "no one" you meant the individual agents out in the field. The guys at the top sure had their expectations.

       I wasnt really concerned with due process. Im more concerned with the sheer amount of resources that will be involved. Maybe you can help with my ignorance here. If someone is caught illegally entering the u.s. (say, maybe half a mile from the border) do they go to court, first? Or do they get deported immediately? I understand offering everyone due process, and how this all overwhelms the system. Butbmy main concern on this point is the amount of taxpayer assets going towards kids who dont belong here legally. The way i see it, by providing shelter and whatnot for this huge amount of people, they are also extending the duration for a solution (like deportation.) Once all the kids find their place on bases and other holding areas, some will no doubt be there for quite some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       That money is better spent, at least imo, on making the border more secure in the first place, and to reinforce the judicial process for deportations. Treat the underlying problem rather than the symptoms. The way they are going about it makes it seem like they are supporting these kids for perpetual residence.

       Well, some people woukd theorize that he is going to provide them with amnesty. Seeing obamas track record for selective enforcement of duties, i dont think thats too farfetched to ponder. For the record, i dont think that will happen, but i woukdnt be surprised. The benefit for obama there woukd be an influx of folks who would vote for him and his ideals for granting them amnesty. Then theres that whole "love me because i am a humanitarian" type of persona he likes to portray himself as.

      <p>
       What do you mean they wont get deported? I understand if they wont get deported immediately, but they need to be deported promptly.

       Another question:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Are you even a little suspicious of this situation at all? Or do you view this as more of a random, one time type of thing?
       </li>

       I've heard reports that there are almost daily greyhound bus dropoffs in places like corpus christie, and that the crime rates have skyrocketed there (mostly break/enter/theft.) What do you know about this?

       That was from the DHS's solicitation for escorts for the children in question. I couldnt find anything about what he claimed about no searches for the children or anything along those lines, but there does seem to be some air charters providing transportation.

       While in the US for 11 months I received two traffic violation tickets totaling nearly $500.  I had to sign a piece of paper to not be sent to jail and then my "bail" amount came in the mail.  I sure felt like a criminal but I'm glad that you don't see it that way.  Currently I'm living in Europe and so keeping my self clean in America.
