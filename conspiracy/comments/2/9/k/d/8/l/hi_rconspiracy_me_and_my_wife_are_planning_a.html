    <div class="md"><ul>
<li> You may be required to show your passport to prove you are not a terrorist sympathizer. PROTIP: If you are brown, it won&#39;t matter.<br/></li>
<li>Americanized versions of foreign movies are available through Hulu, edited for content and patriotism. Importing movies will incur the wrath of the MAFIAA, and you will be financially penalized based on the totally arbitrary pirate matrix rating of the movies.</li>
<li>Protesting has been completely outlawed in the US as of 2009, mostly due to a lack of interest. Attempting to avoid fluoride intake is a double ungood thoughtcrime, punishable by several forced viewings of Nancy Grace. </li>
<li>If you must talk to locals, please attempt to sound as Anglo as possible. It doesn&#39;t hurt to research the behaviors exhibited in American reality television shows, as this is how you can expect the compliant sectors of the population (approx. 85% at last count) to act. If you want to get lucky while in country, pretend to be outrageously Jewish. Stockholm Syndrome is all the rage Stateside these days. </li>
<li>Foreign tourists are not expected to salute Obama shrines unless they are on private property. (WalMart, Wall St, Federal Reserve, ect.) However, your voluntary compliance is appreciated and in some cases, enforced. </li>
<li>The healthcare system is not a joke, because it is American. Only American citizens that vote in our rigged elections and succumb to the threat of violence from the state to pay non-representative taxes are allowed to malign the health care system. And even then, they must do it in the privacy of their own homes. Publicly speaking, Americans accept that they have the right to participate in the least effective, most expensive healthcare system in the developed world and they are thankful for that right. </li>
<li>Currently, the only military coups that can be expected in Stateside involve the uprising of the local police forces against American citizens. Your local embassy will issue warnings far ahead of time to get you out of country and out of the crossfire. These police forces have no interest in you unless they can rob you immediately, so you are relatively safe from persecution in that regard. </li>
<li>You should be able to survive on $750 fiat dollars a day easily. If you get here this week. </li>
<li>You are free to engage the Federally sanctioned local tour guides at each point of interest. Be warned, however: The commonly accepted historical timeline in the US diverges wildly from the understood historical timeline common to the rest of the globe. Recommend that you DO NOT, under any circumstances, attempt to correct what you would see as... inconsistencies comparative to the globally accepted historical timeline. This could potentially cause an incident where you are accused of making &#39;terroristic threats&#39; against the relative ignorant peace in the vicinity. SWAT teams WILL engage. If you need any information on how SWAT teams operate, the youtube is a vast eye-opening resource. </li>
<li>You are best served to wait until after you have returned safely to your home country to engage in collection of subversive materials. You could accidentally end up a permanent resident of the Fascist States Of America otherwise. This will, most likely, be your only warning. </li>
</ul>

<p>Try to enjoy your stay, or you will be fined. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about these things in Russia either. Maybe NK, but I am sure most of that is fear-mongering Western propaganda.</p>

<p>If you are <em>actually</em> going to the US, don&#39;t expect to end up in a US city and have the conveniences found in the rest of the cities on the planet: 24 hour money exchanges, easy public transportation, people holding signs for hotels/rooms.</p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t have a car then you are fucked.</p>

<p>The real irony is that depending on what country you are coming from, you should expect to be harassed by US officials at the border.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t talk to the police. In this country they are not here to help you.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t expect anyone to know your language. They will probably just yell at you to &quot;SPEAK ENGLISH OR GET OUT.&quot;</p>

<p>Nice try though with your troll post.</p>
