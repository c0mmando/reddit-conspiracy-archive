        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-06-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Laura_Poitras.html">Laura_Poitras</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://rt.com/usa/162576-nbc-snowden-september-attack/">Snowden believes in the official story on 9/11.</a></p>

<p>First off, if you don&#39;t know who Laura Poitras or Pierre Omidyar are, then you have much reading to do before you even consider if Snowden/Greenwald are limited hangout.</p>

<p>Consider Snowden and Greenwald to be part of a limited hangout operation where they serve as dis-info and controlled opposition agents. </p>

<p>But, why?</p>

<p>Many reasons..</p>

<p>Most importantly, IMO... is fear and having a controlled opposition figure for those who TPTB view as the bigges threat (people who value liberty and the Constitution)</p>

<p>1) Fear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But do consider that in Eastern Germany, for instance, it was the fear of a machine of surveillance that people believed watched them at all times — rather than the machine itself — that drove compliance and passivity. From the standpoint of the police state and its interests — why have a giant Big Brother apparatus spying on us at all times — unless we know about it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to best combat dissent (which they are definitely doing), and to fight for national security (the security of certain governments controlled by TPTB), you need the people to be scared. </p>

<p><strong>They want everyone to know</strong> that whatever they type, whomever they call, whatever they text and email, who they call and what they say, they know about it too.</p>

<p><strong>What was the aim of COINTELPRO</strong>? Go after certain groups that were deemed a <strong>threat</strong> to the status quo. (Anyone who questioned the Vietnam war).</p>

<p>Consider this: <strong>The biggest leak that Greenwald thinks</strong>, that should be released soon, is <strong>Who they are targeting</strong>... We already know who is targeted! </p>

<p>Skeptics of Snowden and limited hangout talk would say, &#39;but they told us about JTRIG!&#39;. Did you not already know what they do online in places like internet forums? </p>

<p><strong>What was the aim of Operation Mockingbird</strong>? Use media as propaganda to control thought and the conversation. Obviously you know that today&#39;s coprorate news is propaganda. On the American front you have CNN/NBC/Foxnews, British BBC or Guardian or Qatari Al Jazeera etc etc. </p>

<p>Perhaps the best signal that you should be highly skeptical of Snowden is the 40 minute interview with Brian Williams. Please, if you are hearing about it by the corporate news it is done so for a reason.</p>

<p>But again, it is fear.</p>

<p>They want the people to be scared of their government. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything they do, they will justify it as combating terrorism and fighting for national security. (protip, securing the status quo)</p>

<p>2) Controlled opposition figure, hero for the masses.</p>

<p>When Snowden came out, I for one loved him. I loved Greenwald. They were fighting for justice against the tyrannical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if they are on the front page of the NYT or WaPo, they aren&#39;t revolutionary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) Controlling the conversation</p>

<p>Classic limited hangout operations, which &#39;release selected portions of a scandal to prevent further criticism/hangout in the public eye&#39;, is done so to control the conversation.</p>

<p>Article by article, Greenwald has told us SO much. (remember, nothing important or new has been released, NOTHING ON 9/11). </p>

<p>But, they&#39;ll say the documents were from 2009 and such, or they&#39;ll say hey we know of PRISM and JTRIG.</p>

<p>... If anything, Snowdent old you the name of the programs that have been in operation for ATLEAST a decade.</p>

<p>Limited hangout is telling everyone that all phone calls in Afghanistan are recorded... in order to prevent them from knowing that <strong>EVERY PHONE CALL MADE IN THE WORLD IS RECORDED</strong></p>

<p>4) Condition and desensitize the people</p>

<p>&quot;Stay tuned for the next big leak!&quot;</p>

<p>The slow process that Greenwald has done is thang desensitizes the people to the issue. They get used to hearing it, every few weeks they see an article and they get used to it.</p>

<p>&#39;oh well, i have nothing to hide&#39;</p>

<p>Remember, TPTB view the people as the threat, they view us as animals. They know how easily the masses can be manipulated. But, they are also scared of a certain type.</p>

<p>The type that.. questions things. The divergent one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They don&#39;t want a population capable of critical thinking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yes, believe  what the corporate media tells you about 9/11, and believe what they tell you about Snowden. </p>

<p>So,</p>

<p>In brief, if you think 9/11 was a false flag, you probably think Snowden/Greenwald are limited hangout. </p>

<p>You may ask, what do they have to gain by having Snowden leak?</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Snowden said that he carefully reviewed everything he leaked because he thought it&#39;d be in the public interest. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-docs-did-snowden-take-2013-12">Where did Snowden get the time to vet 1.7 million documents?</a></p></li>
<li><p>You will not know everything Snowden &#39;leaked&#39;. Whose decision is it that decides what the people will and will not know? Well, if it &quot;leads to deaths&quot;, Greenwald believes that the information shouldn&#39;t be made public. General Keith Alexander also lobbies against such leaks because they&#39;d <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/03/25/nsa-director-to-jimmy-carter-agency-not-spying-on-your-emails/">lead to deaths</a></p></li>

<p>Snowden&#39;s revelations are being disclosed for the same reason most any event of significance has occurred since 9/11 or so, and that reason, in summary, is as follows: you are meant to distrust the system. Listen to me. <em>All</em> suspicion of the crooked system, no matter how slight, will incline a person more closely toward <em>investigating further.</em> To investigate these matters, then, is to subject oneself to the same radical outlets and fringe sources to which <em>we,</em> the conspiracy theorists, are exposed. As a <em>result</em> of being made aware of the information circulating through these particular channels, an observer, by his exposure to this broader pool of data, is, thus, <em>prompted</em> to entertain new beliefs, and prompted, <em>specifically,</em> to adopt two new perspectives that are each of a particular significance.</p>

<p>you should recognize these perspectives immediately, as they arise naturally in response to encountering the same information to which we are so readily exposed. One of these perspectives, of course, is that rejecting the present system is justified, and even necessary. The other is that there exists a spiritual truth, suppressed by the forces currently in power, the acknowledgment of which has the ability to deliver man from bondage, evolve his consciousness, and even directly affect reality by the use of willpower. Sound familiar? What I am telling you is that each of these two beliefs is intentionally being cultivated among the general population, and that this process is being performed through the avenues of, for one, selectively released information, and two, behaviors which arise in response to that information.</p>

<p>the purpose of this process is to encourage the individual, and, eventually, the population at large, toward replacing the current system with a new, global society structured around the <em>mysteries,</em> just as secret societies in present day are structured around the mysteries. The result of the completion of this process is the very New Age spoken of by Aleister Crowley and all manner of esoteric wisdom teacher -- a New Age of Illuminism, existing specifically for the purpose of turning the entire world away from Jesus Christ. All of this is ultimately a spiritual matter, and these things are all much more real than your current paradigms will likely allow you to believe. But all of that is going to change <em>very soon,</em> and within your lifetimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I promise you, these folks would never let the real true spiritual reality of who we are be made known to the public. We are spiritual beings. But we are being deeply suppressed from our true nature. Honestly to me, Christianity is just another box that keeps people from their true nature. In the west, our main spiritual-mythology is Christianity. But that&#39;s completely arbitrary because in other parts of the world, it&#39;s a different mythology. But they are the same: Watered-down avenues towards a shallow, cartoon brand of spirituality which cloaks a hierarchical top-down command structure to keep large groups of people in line. </p>

<p>People are spirits, it&#39;s just that simple. Some individuals don&#39;t need this connection while playing their game in this Hologram (atheists, disinterested agnostics, people having too much fun just living life, etc), but as a species &amp; society, it behooves TPTB to have a ready made structure for the spiritual nature of mankind, so that it can be dampened down, tranquilized, poisoned &amp; eventually destroyed. Certainly leading us away from the deeper truths, keeping us in conformed groups, following laws, repeating phrases, pantomiming, genuflecting, getting locked into their system basically. Illusions of spiritual depths, but very shallow &amp; rudimentary. </p>

<p>Not going to disparage Jesus Christ, though I have learned enough about post-pagan &amp; pre-Christian Gnostics that I definitely do not buy most of what the Bible puts out about him. Too many similarities to various other pagan deities designed to simply adulate the sun &amp; the cycles. But what drives me nuts is how most Christians care way more about the old testament than the life this guy supposedly lived.  I always thought his life was supposed to be a lesson to other humans: &quot;Watch Me. See how I treat Others. Use that as a template for You. This is what I &amp; My Father wish You to become.&quot; Seems pretty clear, but no, it&#39;s all hellfire &amp; brimstone, throwing stones at those who don&#39;t follow god&#39;s laws, etc etc. Most Christians fall well short from their self-created perches, at least the ones I deal with out in the real world.</p>

<p>No sorry, that&#39;s not the grand solution that&#39;s going to save mankind. But we are spirits &amp; that is being repressed &amp; obfuscated by TPTB. That alone is a huge piece of the puzzle. What does that imply? Those that enslave you, wish to keep this information away from your mind... Why?  It&#39;s because you are powerful beings, when you have your shit together. </p>

<p>I want you to know that your understanding of <em>this,</em> in particular, is <em>completely</em> accurate. The one God absolutely <em>does</em> intend we each attain to a stature and fullness exactly like the stature and the fullness of Christ, and he did, indeed, place Christ before us for the specific purpose that his example might serve to bring us into this fullness, which it is entirely able to do. All of this is the truth, and we do not disagree at all about these things.</p>

<p>your understanding falls short, however, in regard to what you have concluded is the appropriate response to this information. I will explain. You have come to believe, as far as I can tell, that this truth of Christ suggests there is a <em>divinity within man,</em> perhaps able to be accessed by the efforts of man alone, and perhaps able to be accessed by adopting a particular mystical practice or spiritual worldview. I understand that it is tempting to believe such things, and I also understand that many schools of thought and lines of inquiry will indicate such things are true, but I must assert: this belief is insufficient and false, and is demonstrably so by further analysis.</p>

<p>further analysis is <em>absolutely necessary.</em> For the example of Christ in no way encourages man to attain to spiritual integrity except <em>exclusively</em> through the avenue of an obedience to the God of Scripture and a concession to his Anointed and his redeemer, who is Christ. Furthermore, the example of Christ would have us regard Scripture as holy, as indomitable by the sabotage of man, and as correctly descriptive of God&#39;s will for us as men, demanding we understand its proclamations as truthful and its instructions as integral to walking in righteousness, <em>just</em> as Christ himself understood. That is to say that we are to believe just as Christ believed, attaining to perfection just as Christ himself did attain, not merely in <em>some</em> ways, according to our own conveniences and individual expectations, but in <em>all</em> ways, that the adequacy of Christ&#39;s example and his appointment by God might not be undermined, made irrelevant, or interpreted wrongly.</p>

<p>I assure you that this is good news, and that, according to my own understandings and personal experiences alike, a rightful concession to Christ is both intellectually satisfying and uniquely able to perfect the spirit, having the effect of saving a man&#39;s soul from death, just as is described by Jesus himself. I promise I can not lie about these things. I encourage a deeper examination of my words, of the potentially confusing effects of whatever preconceptions you may already maintain, and, most importantly, of what testimony the Lord himself has made accessible by his works, for his <em>sheep,</em> according to his own testimony, will <em>surely hear his voice.</em></p>

<p>please excuse me if I have insulted you by my disagreements. I mean only to encourage. Cheers.</p>

<p>Exoteric, conventional Christianity maybe. Esoteric Christianity, mystical Christianity, akin to other such mystical &#39;ways&#39; embedded in a truthful, universal metaphysics, will take one all the way, will awaken one to who they are (anamnesis). Take care not to mistake the branded, packaged watered down story presented with what the Christed one was and His message, and the deeper way enveloped within that. Christ (as all of the messengers and Manifestations with the given spiritual authority and powers of the supernal supernatural source are and were), was and is a high mage, of the highest order. The Holy spirit, as a quickening and awakening force, is still transmitted through the words of the Bible, despite its edited quality (if one is sensitive and awake to that transmission).
It is profoundly sad how the form (the church and its schismaticised devlopments, the Bible with its omitted teachings and mistranslations) has been manipulated and become such an instrument of control. We are still in need of the teachers from God, just not the priesthood in my understanding.</p>

<p>I agree with the generality of your propositions and perspective, a well written exposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said that your point was why he would &quot;bring up 9/11 in the first place&quot;, not whether or not he thought it was an inside job. The OP, the way I read it at least, was just pointing it out and not necessarily coming to any conclusions about it. Which is why he posted many other strange circumstances with Snowden and Greenwald.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Admittedly, both of those arguments are wrong. The thing about the belts is that the whole argument is based on an outdated theory that was later proven wrong. In fact even Van Allen himself agreed that the belts were far less dangerous than first thought. On top of this, the astronauts were only in the belts for  relatively short period, and the capsules were designed to be at least somewhat resistant to the radiation. As for the mars thing, well thats all based on some random &quot;marine&quot; who &quot;totally swears he isn&#39;t lying&quot;. </p>

<p>As for the reality thing, there&#39;s a really cool argument that the universe is actually a computer simulation. </p>

<p>I also tend not to think of reality as a singular noun. We all appear to live in our own reality tunnels. The notion of an objective reality seems unreconcilable with this idea. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t surprise me that people who live in a reality where we couldn&#39;t make it to the moon exist alongside people who live in a reality where we made it to Mars. It all makes more sense when you realize teleportation as a mental phenomena rather than a physical phenomena but most educated Westerners (see atheists) refuse to take that ideological step away from reductive materialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll answer this one. Snowden seems like a smart guy. A smart guy concerned with th aftermath of 9/11 would surely investigate the event itself, I mean, with all the obvious discrepancies found in the official narratives. Snowden talks a great deal about the aftermath of 9/11 but he never addresses the controversy surrounding the event itself, aside from this claim that our intelligence system drowned out the obvious warning sounds in a sea of information.</p>

<p>I think Snowden is either controlled opposition or not nearly as smart as he presents himself. Maybe he never questioned the official narrative. Maybe he did and he made up his mind that it was the truth and giving airtime to alternative theories and third party investigation would be unreasonable.</p>

<p>I find it unreasonable for him to not address the elephant in the room which is the controversial event that precipitated the very intelligence network he is snitching on. Thus I suspect he lacks integrity.</p>
