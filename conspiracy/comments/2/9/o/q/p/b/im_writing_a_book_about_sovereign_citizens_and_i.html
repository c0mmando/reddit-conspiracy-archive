       As I said, I'm writing a book about sovereign citizens (redemption movement, detaxers, etc.). I'm a lawyer and my focus is on explaining the legal and historical aspects for other people who are trying to make heads or tails of these documents we keep getting. I think I've got that covered, but I'd really like to include a section on how or why people believe things that don't seem to make sense on the surface. I don't have any background in psychology, sociology, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of judges don't believe that there is anyway anyone actually believe the redemption movement stuff and they can come down pretty harshly. I'm looking for help on sources or materials that can  help soften that a little and show that there are people who truly believe. If there are true believers, it's for a reason and we need to try to fix the problems, even if the reasons they are giving aren't legally correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr I need to know why people believe things that appear nonsensical. Thanks in advance!

       Sorry. I have a newborn, I pulled an all nighter, I had a bench trial this morning, and I diagrammed an electrical circuit this afternoon, so I'm probably not making a whole lot of sense at this point. I was basically looking for something to counter judges who say, "There is absolutely no way that anyone believes this bullshit. They only pull this crap to try to get out of trouble." Someone was kind enough to point me towards the Dunning-Kruger effect and that's just the kind of thing I was looking for.

       Why would a judge ever say that?

      <p>
       How is it relevant to their job whether or not someone truly believes in the law? If I tell a judge I don't think murder is a crime my belief is irrelevant to whether or not it is a crime.

       Well, it can be very relevant in different circumstances. You should check out yesterday's Hobby Lobby decision (and the whole line of cases dealing with "sincerely held beliefs;" peyote comes up in that context, btw). We aren't dealing with a faith issue in sovereignty arguments, but the sincerity of the belief plays into whether or not someone is treated as a "vexatious litigant." If they are, their complaint can be dismissed with prejudice and they won't be allowed to refile it. If the judge doesn't think they are just trying to be assholes about it, they can give them a chance to refile the complaint (if there is any hint of a meritous argument underneath all the legalese). Judges have large amounts of discretion about how much help to offer pro se litigants (which sovereigns almost always are) and that can make the difference between a successful claim and an unsuccessful one. I hope that made sense...if not, I'll try again tomorrow.

       In the context of your question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Presuming the sovereign movement to be with merit, it is irrelevant if they are saying it just to get out of trouble-- it's the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presuming the sovereign movement is unfounded, it is irrelevant if they truly believe it-- it's the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the court is basing it's decisions of of whether or not one truly believes to be a sovereign citizen (which would be an irresponsible analog to your peyote example) it is entirely irrelevant in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Off topic, the enforceability of peyote abolition re: religious freedom is endemic of bad laws that have no place in our legal system;  the state should not be able to prosecute you for victimizing yourself.

       You can tell me it's relevant or irrelevant, but I'm telling you how it actually plays out. I've clerked for three judges. There is nothing that will save a sovereignty argument, but to extent that there may be a cognizable claim on different grounds, a court is lot more inclined to give the person another chance of they don't think the person is just harassing the court. I have yet to see a sovereign pleading that made even a bit of sense. They are mentally taxing to read because the words don't make any sense together. I don't think that's what's important though. I'm more concerned about the reasons people try to make the arguments. It's often based on desperate circumstances (foreclosures, job loss, terrible poverty and stressful domestic relations). I think bringing some empathy into the equation could actually end up helping people who need help. And I agree with you about the peyote. I feel the same way about assisted suicide.

       Thanks. I haven't looked at the Hawaii issue yet. I can't seem to get my question right! Basically, I understand the legal arguments behind sovereign citizenship. Frankly, most of it is simply huge misunderstandings of how the law works. I was more curious about why people continue to believe it, even after it has failed over and over again (for going on forty years now). I knew there were some cognitive theories out there, but I couldn't remember anything about them.

       I took a few psychology courses in college, but to be honest i never really paid attention. However, there is that whole nature vs nurture thing, and if you havent already, id suggest using that as a platform to launch your investigation in this sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, you can ask, "is it genetics that cause people to beljeve in other-than-mainstream stuff?" Or you can ask, "Or is it how they were raised?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the answer is simewhere in the middle; genetics ("nature") must play a role to establish the intelligence needed to understand things in depth. However, if they never have parents who teach them that its okay to question things (an example of "nurture"), then they woukd never open up to non-mainstream ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were taught to ask questions, then they woukd be able to ask certain questions, and through shear curioisity have fallen down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, maybe investigate how certain traits are common amongst thosd who think non-mainstream---addictive personalities, ocd tendencies, adhd or ither mental stuff goin on, job/career choices... Etc.. i bet there could be a link by doing research for any correlations....
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats basicallly all i can say, cuz i havent even heard of the redememption movement.. gotta do some research...

        As I said, I'm writing a book about sovereign citizens (redemption movement, detaxers, etc.). I'm a lawyer and my focus is on explaining the legal and historical aspects for other people who are trying to make heads or tails of these documents we keep getting. I think I've got that covered, but I'd really like to include a section on how or why people believe things that don't seem to make sense on the surface. I don't have any background in psychology, sociology, etc.
A lot of judges don't believe that there is anyway anyone actually believe the redemption movement stuff and they can come down pretty harshly. I'm looking for help on sources or materials that can help soften that a little and show that there are people who truly believe.
        <strong>
         If there are true believers, it's for a reason and we need to try to fix the problems, even if the reasons they are giving aren't legally correct.
        </strong>
        tl;dr I need to know why people believe things that appear nonsensical. Thanks in advance!

       I think part of the problem is that I don't even know exactly what it is that I'm looking for, but someone told me to look at the Dunning Krueger effect and that's the kind of thing I was wondering about. I'm having trouble understanding why people keep trying this tactic over and over again when it hasn't worked. Why can't the legal profession persuade sovereigns that we really don't take a secret oath to keep a shadow judicial system hidden from anyone? It defies all logic to think that over a million people could all keep a secret, against their own self-interest, but there is a large number of people who can't be persuaded otherwise. In fact, they double down when you show them evidence that their theory isn't correct. I'd like access to a secret trust account with millions of dollars in it. Fuck being a lawyer, I'd retire and never look back!  I figured that there are probably studies out there to explain this type of belief and that's essentially what I was looking for. I lucked out and I've gotten links to a lot of things outside that topic that have been helpful.

       Exactly. I don't have to believe in a UN takeover plot to know that the poor are getting fucked left, right and center. The cronyism is unreal. My state is FULL of people who live in extreme poverty and we still have legislators who make no secret of the fact that they don't give a flying fuck about them. It has to change or we have to be cool with people losing it and retaliating. We can't have both.

       We already have both. This "it" that has to change is not something or a system, but people. People have been infected with a mentality that is perpetuated by the "it" that you mention.

       Well, it's people who change the system. So you're right. I don't even know anymore. It's all so depressing and it feels like I'm constantly raging against the machine and it doesn't matter.  I don't know the answer. And I hate that.

       Sorry, I think it was in another thread. I wrote this last night. I'll copy it here: My name's Jenny, I'm an attorney in Little Rock.  My husband also an attorney. We're privileged to have opportunities to work on legislation, talk to legislators and work with judges and we want to take advantage of that to do what we can to help fix things. I'm sorry if you're offended that I joined the other group. I've been really saddened by a lot of the vitriol I've seen from it. I'll take some time to figure out which groups are cool and which aren't tomorrow, but Im running on 40 hours awake in a row and I've got a little baby who will be up in 3 hours, so I'm going to bed.

       I'm not excusing their behavior or beliefs. We all have a duty to operate within the bounds of the law, and violence is not the answer. But take a good hard look at yourself, the judicial system, and law enforcement. Is it any wonder that there are so many people who feel angry and disaffected? People go to jail for fines, despite the fact that we aren't supposed to have a debtors' prison system anymore. Millionaires can rape their kids and get away with no jail time at all, but a black kid selling some dried up plants gets years of jail time. Cops make the news everyday for shocking abuses of civil rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banks (and the Congress that deregulated them) have costs thousands and thousands of people their homes and preyed on people hit the hardest by economic circumstances beyond their control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some representatives and judges get sold to the highest bidder, but people are afraid to speak out because it might hurt their career (or their future clients). Candidates for AG are deliberately misrepresenting the Constitution to curry favor with low information voters because of greed for power. Everyone is just taking care of number one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not done nearly enough to speak out against an unfair system. Here's my own personal revolution: no more hiding behind fear. I will call out injustice where I see it, when I see it, and I'm not holding back. If you don't want these right wing extremists to continue to inflict terror on our society, I invite you to join me.

       Also, I have never taken any time to look into major conspiracy theories (9/11, Sandy Hook, etc.). I've just dismissed them out of hand, but now that I've had a chance to read some stuff in this group and I see that it's not a bunch of crazies, I'm willing to keep an open mind and take a look. I can't promise I'll believe any of it, but I can promise that I come in peace.

       A book about sovereign citizens wouldn't call them sovereign citizens. Citizens are subjects. Sovereigns can't be subjects.

       Sovereign Citizen is one of the names some of the people who identify with this movement use. I'm not using the term to indicate that I endorse the idea; it's used as a proper noun. If I say that someone is part of the Moorish movement, I don't mean to indicate that I've verified their Moorish ancestry, etc.  For brevity's sake, I think it makes sense to use the term that most people are familiar with.  There are lots of other names that I identify in my intro though, as some members of this movement also reject that name.

       Sorry. I have a newborn, I pulled an all nighter, I had a bench trial this morning, and I diagrammed an electrical circuit this afternoon, so I'm probably not making a whole lot of sense at this point. I was basically looking for something to counter judges who say, "There is absolutely no way that anyone believes this bullshit. They only pull this crap to try to get out of trouble." Someone was kind enough to point me towards the Dunning-Kruger effect and that's just the kind of thing I was looking for.

       Thanks. I haven't looked at the Hawaii issue yet. I can't seem to get my question right! Basically, I understand the legal arguments behind sovereign citizenship. Frankly, most of it is simply huge misunderstandings of how the law works. I was more curious about why people continue to believe it, even after it has failed over and over again (for going on forty years now). I knew there were some cognitive theories out there, but I couldn't remember anything about them.

       Well, it can be very relevant in different circumstances. You should check out yesterday's Hobby Lobby decision (and the whole line of cases dealing with "sincerely held beliefs;" peyote comes up in that context, btw). We aren't dealing with a faith issue in sovereignty arguments, but the sincerity of the belief plays into whether or not someone is treated as a "vexatious litigant." If they are, their complaint can be dismissed with prejudice and they won't be allowed to refile it. If the judge doesn't think they are just trying to be assholes about it, they can give them a chance to refile the complaint (if there is any hint of a meritous argument underneath all the legalese). Judges have large amounts of discretion about how much help to offer pro se litigants (which sovereigns almost always are) and that can make the difference between a successful claim and an unsuccessful one. I hope that made sense...if not, I'll try again tomorrow.
