       The PIA is seeking researchers who are disciplined and able to work collaboratively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have devised a system which will minimize the effectiveness of infiltration and enable us to build an online organization as shill-proof as possible.

      <p>
       The People's Intelligence Agency will function as a meritocracy. One way you build trust within the organization is by completing assignments.

       The PIA's mission is to ensure intelligence serves the public good, rather than state &amp; corporate interests.

       A public subreddit has been created,
       <a href="/r/publicintelligence">

       Yep! I've offered to share the information I have for free with anyone who joins, and we will be working together to narrativize that information while supplementing it with additional research so that it can be easily digested by a broad public audience. If you're skeptical, you can join (without giving me any personal information), ask me for information related to a subject you're interested in, and judge its quality for yourself. You don't have to work on a project the PIA is undertaking if you don't want to.

       My belief is that we should go the other way with this. There are so many people that want to bring truth to the people that its probably better if we dont remain anonymous. I have nothing to hide, im on the path of truth and im not going to let fear of consequences get in the way of that. Silence breeds repression. So I will stand up and be heard and if they take me down, another will take my place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more people who stand up to the threats to  activism by letting themselves be known who they are, the worse its going to be for the people that are trying to persecute us. When the world sees how many people are working on the side of truth, when the hammer comes down its going to be known to all and it will allow them to choose where they stand. I think that now that we have a communication system that allows us to send our message to people in a short amount of time is our protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the only thing I have a problem with is trying to centralize it with a name or ideal.
The peoples intelligence commonwealths is more appropriate. This thing needs to be distributed, not centralized in name or concept.

       When they know who you are, they can make it about you and character assassination can be a formidable weapon. I want to deprive them of this weapon to the greatest extent possible, and ensure that if my identity comes out, it happens in a way that forces them to admit that they really do care about what happens here.

       On the topic of distribution, organization and information are you in agreement with that?

       No it's more like a part of each commonwealth.  Every commonwealth needs to share part of the process of gathering and distributing intelligence among the commonwealths. If we have just one central intelligence apparatus hooked into it that part becomes more powerful then the parts it's connected to.  Similar to what's happening right now with the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each commonwealth should have its own group or representative that takes part in the gathering and distribution efforts in real time as the information is being released. The information should be stored  using some kind of file sharing protocol like BitTorrent. That way if one peer gets shut down the information can continue to be accessed. I still think it's a good idea for each representative to be vetted based on his or her participation.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO the biggest problem we have to face is people becoming ego centered in their efforts and subjecting themselves corruption by outside influences after they had been established in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why it's important for it to be run as a collective. Any thoughts and ideas to improve the situation of preventing an intelligence gathering effort from becoming centralized would be welcome. I won't support anything that can be taken over by one or more individuals.

       If the wires are connected, monitoring can occur.
      </p>

       I like the idea of pooling efforts toward a common positive goal, yet I abhor secrecy- your reasoning for "inner circles" is to prevent people from "derailing" your efforts.  I say ideas stand on their own merit, if it's a good idea it can't be derailed so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support your desire to know technically how tor would be compromised, yet I would argue you should merely look at the capabilities of the physical technology and presume those capabilities are being exploited.  An example I can think of is that smartphones can read rfid hardware.  Most modern cash have rfid in them.  This means that every banknote can be individually numerated and monitored anywhere in proximity to smartphones.  This is an incredible power, yet nobody seems to suspect it would be utilized for some reason.

       So according to you everything is compromised but TOR. You want a group of people to join your cause on TOR, synonymous with the darknet. A place in which people can stare back at you as you use the web.

       There is evidence. Just read what other users say. I would have used it years ago if it weren't for people complaining about how easy it was to tap into someone's camera on heir pc. Just go to the TOR sub reddit.

       They  don't care. Because of credibility. Most people will cling to whatever was said first. Most people hear what the officials want them to hear. Most people think however the officials conditioned them to think. You can expose the very fabric of this reality and most people will not care or believe you. Truth shall prevail but for most humans credibility equals truth. Most will die never knowing the difference. That's why they don't care unless you are doing something illegal.

       He is a narcissist. It doesn't mean that he didn't leak valuable Intel. But all he did was watch an old 60 minutes program on the NSA and echelon or scoured the pages of cryptome. He didn't release anything new. However the media were all over it this time.

       Don't give me that much credit. If it was cointel pro I wouldn't have exposed myself as a devils advocate. I would have brown nosed my way in then derided your intel gathering with bullshit info. Cointelpro ops are never this obvious. The knowledge required to successfully operate a cointelpro op is beyond bernays understanding.

       Really, China and Russia are communist societies. Well. Corrupt "communist" but still an enemy to the US interests. You cannot deny he fled there.

       None of what he revealed was new. It was in the media through various sources the most popular being 60 minutes. Maybe the media is different where you are but in the Washington DC area it was known by those that paid attention to these things.

       Snowden isn't viable. You should use bradley manning instead as your hero. He did it for truth and most people can agree with that.

       Neither do your links. Why should I trust your sources? You sure they are not a figment of the pentagons imagination?  Didn't the SCOTUS decide that the right to lie is,protected free speech ( citizens united).  I'd recommend that you google the art of subversion.  If you don't believe it you can at least get an understanding of what you are up against.

       The NSA "collects it all." The CIA/Google have been funding a company called "recorded future" which records web activity since 2010. DARPA even has a program which can tell who people are based on textual analysis alone with a pretty high degree of accuracy. That the NSA knows who I am probably says more about the spooks than it does about me.

       Creepy.  I opened a LinkedIn account (because I'm an idiot) and like the second person to look at the profile was from darpa.  It was kinda validating and uncomfortable at once.  Then there was a different UPS guy the other day and he had a strange vibration to him.  You can probably guess what my response to the "recruiting" guy is gonna be ;)

       Things must be judged on their merits, we should all know by now not to trust anything blindly. If the organization produces solid research then, in a similar fashion to their contribution requirements, the net result is good. If it's some nefarious plot at controlled opposition, hopefully we'll notice.

       I'm responding harshly because all you did was dangle a shitty carrot. So what about other redditots/shills performing cointelpro tricks. That will always happen. I want to see one good example of real information. Not threats of exposing people. Not recycled stories from rense over a decade ago. This reminds me of those revelations that UFOologists keep hoping for. You are trying to lure these people.

Is there a follow up on Hastings death? And the last article was  detailed.

       My personal stance is on the NSA etc etc...since I have known about their capabilities before 9-11 ...meh.  If information is broadcast it is not considered private. 
If the NSA decides to bug our homes or vehicles then I would be outraged.

       The story on creating sock puppets is a confirmation of something I had long suspected when truthers were posting legitimate documents.

       To address your link: that's a pretty weird post and I think it's kinda creepy that you felt the need to dig through two weeks of my comment history in order to figure out that I'm suspicious of Snowden and Greenwald.  If you wanted to know my opinion you could've just asked me.

       It goes back to the Hegelian idea of creating a conflict and then controlling both sides of the conflict and, thus, controlling the outcome.  The people who control public perception are masters of subtlety, propaganda, coercion, suggestion, etc (they've had many, many years of practice after all).  Sowing confusion and discord among people who are attempting to find the truth about things has always been one of their main objectives.

       It's over a year later and ~98% of the documents still haven't been released.  Maybe you're right, maybe they're both legit, but I'll retain my skepticism until I have something more solid to go on.  As of now, the Snowden/Greenwald team is almost exactly what I would imagine if I were to picture what a limited hangout psy-op would look like in my mind.

       I think we've talked about this before and I do agree with what you're saying - I, too, am incredibly suspicious of both Snowden and Greenwald.  I'm still trying to keep an open mind but I have to say that, as of right now, I think they both are part of a larger psy-op (whether either of them knows it or not).

       My opinion about your sub (I'm assuming it's your sub?) is that not all of the subscribers are legit users.  I believe that it has been "infiltrated" to some extent just as many subs on reddit have been, especially those that talk about "sensitive topics".  That said, I myself am a subscriber, and there's a lot of great info there.

       I believe that the system I designed will work because that decision doesn't have to be made. The only way a shill can gain access to the inner circles of the PIA is by completing assignments for us, which would mean producing intelligence for the public which is not in the interest of whoever is employing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't literally shut shills out but it disincentivizes shill involvement by increasing the cost of infiltration.

       Julian Assange referred to wikileaks as the people's intelligence agency in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of the PIA is to bring together dedicated conspiracy researchers so that we can work on a variety of projects for the public good without shills derailing and misleading us. Organization is important, so that we are able to maximize our effectiveness and ability to act collectively.

       A word of advice: Instead of relying solely on tor, use a VPN to connect to tor and encrypt your data. Better yet, cascade VPNs and use a Virtual Machine on an encrypted disk then connect to tor and encrypt everything. That's assuming you have any data worth protecting.
