    <div class="md"><p>I have to the best of my ability. I brush with fluoride-free toothpaste (which tastes delicious) and my teeth are very clean. It&#39;s an ayurvedic brand:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Auromere-Fresh-Ayurvedic-Formula-Toothpaste/dp/B0029F7LUG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1404052685&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=auromere+toothpaste">http://www.amazon.com/Auromere-Fresh-Ayurvedic-Formula-Toothpaste/dp/B0029F7LUG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1404052685&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=auromere+toothpaste</a></p>

<p>The town I live in does not add fluoride to their tap water, but they still add a shit ton of chlorine... so I drink Arrowhead distilled water which does not have any fluoride (I called to check because some dumbass brands still add it after the distillation process).</p>

<p>That&#39;s about all I can do I think. There&#39;s really no way to be sure whether or not a food manufacturer uses fluoridated water in their products so I&#39;m likely eating a ton of fluoridated, GMO food. Sadly they don&#39;t tell us about either in the labels here in California.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve cut it out of my toothpaste, and try to cut it out of my drinking water at home via distillation, but it&#39;s kind of impossible to do when you eat out and travel. The most you can really do is minimize.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I&#39;ve had zero adverse effect from changing toothpastes, my teeth are just as clean, teeth are whiter and less sensitive, bad breath has decreased, and my gums don&#39;t get all bleedy anymore. This could be less about cutting out the fluoride than starting to use coconut oil as an occasional mouthwash and no more sodium lauryl sulfate in my toothpaste, which is a real agitator for a lot of people (including me; skin has cleared up after moving to SLS-free shampoo/conditioner/soaps, too).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are brands, you can find online. You have to look at all the favors offered by a particular brand too. Some will have things and others won&#39;t. Fluoride isn&#39;t the only thing to avoid. You can also buy home made stuff. I use a clay powder. It&#39;s by medicine wheel out of Maine. Tastes awful though. You can get a lot of home made things at farmers markets. Bottled water also has fluoride. You can see Erich brands use more or less online. There are special filters you can buy too. They&#39;ll treat a few thousand liters but they&#39;re not cheap, couple hundred dollars. You HAVE to read the label on everything you consume. Avoid sugar-alcohols, avoid aspartame, and chemical sweeteners. They&#39;re in EVERYTHING btw. It&#39;s a constant quest. I&#39;ve been steadily removing it all for the past three years. It is. Processes for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The non-diet version of glee gum is safe but honestly it&#39;s expensive, nearly flavorless, and doesn&#39;t do much for bad breath. There are two UK studies that link migraine headaches in adolescent populations (in the UK) to gum chewing. One report concluded it was due to mastication fatigue of the lower jaw placing tension on the skull, and the other linked it to aspartame. Interestingly in both studies disuse for even a few hours reduced migraines in 60% of the cohorts. Apparently kids chew gum ALL day long. I was never a gum chewer but there ya have it. I do know that there are lots of sites devoted to all-natural living. There is a subreddit I goto a lot called r/simpleliving that has been helpful. One thing that has worked for me in general is asking myself Do I really need this &quot;thing right now&quot;, and I also fanatically read labels. I know if you can grow it, or make it from scratch, you&#39;re better off 99% of the time. I personally find it really relaxing and therapeutic. The more people rejecting consumption the more difficult it will be for corporations and the MIC to poison our body and minds. It&#39;s not easy though. I just got dumped, I make a great living, and dating again I see how consumed people are with &quot;stuff&quot;. And it&#39;s very lonely. Nobody wants to hear you preach about reducing, they just want you to be a means to things they want. Well what I want is kindness and respect and that&#39;s about it. I told that to two dates I had this past week. One told me to shut up. The other did a double take. That one pays 2400 a month to live in the Charlestown Navy yard. She told me, Lordofthegodkings, I finally make enough money to afford my lifestyle and you&#39;re going to tell me it&#39;s all for naught? I really offended her. Poor kid..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One day they&#39;ll figure it out. It&#39;s hard and unpleasant to hear it when you&#39;re on the work-buy-work treadmill. Jumping off it is terrifying, too. My favorite comparison is having a $500+ molecular gastronomy type meal and comparing it to &lt;$10 Peruvian chicken on a spit and fried yuca with spicy aji sauce and realizing that for sheer happiness on all accounts, the chicken beats all--any day of the week. But damn, is that a tough and embarassing realization when you just dropped that much dough on <em>one</em> meal...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe online or if you&#39;ve got a specialty food store (in the US, we have little co-ops or places like Whole Foods that tend to stock it). Auromere looks good to me, Spry has Xylitol and aloe, which is supposed to be helpful, but I&#39;m not an expert in toothpaste ingredients. :)</p>
