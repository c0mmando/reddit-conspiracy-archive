       I have to the best of my ability. I brush with fluoride-free toothpaste (which tastes delicious) and my teeth are very clean. It's an ayurvedic brand:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The town I live in does not add fluoride to their tap water, but they still add a shit ton of chlorine... so I drink Arrowhead distilled water which does not have any fluoride (I called to check because some dumbass brands still add it after the distillation process).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's about all I can do I think. There's really no way to be sure whether or not a food manufacturer uses fluoridated water in their products so I'm likely eating a ton of fluoridated, GMO food. Sadly they don't tell us about either in the labels here in California.

       I've cut it out of my toothpaste, and try to cut it out of my drinking water at home via distillation, but it's kind of impossible to do when you eat out and travel. The most you can really do is minimize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anecdotally, I've had zero adverse effect from changing toothpastes, my teeth are just as clean, teeth are whiter and less sensitive, bad breath has decreased, and my gums don't get all bleedy anymore. This could be less about cutting out the fluoride than starting to use coconut oil as an occasional mouthwash and no more sodium lauryl sulfate in my toothpaste, which is a real agitator for a lot of people (including me; skin has cleared up after moving to SLS-free shampoo/conditioner/soaps, too).

       There are brands, you can find online. You have to look at all the favors offered by a particular brand too. Some will have things and others won't. Fluoride isn't the only thing to avoid. You can also buy home made stuff. I use a clay powder. It's by medicine wheel out of Maine. Tastes awful though. You can get a lot of home made things at farmers markets. Bottled water also has fluoride. You can see Erich brands use more or less online. There are special filters you can buy too. They'll treat a few thousand liters but they're not cheap, couple hundred dollars. You HAVE to read the label on everything you consume. Avoid sugar-alcohols, avoid aspartame, and chemical sweeteners. They're in EVERYTHING btw. It's a constant quest. I've been steadily removing it all for the past three years. It is. Processes for sure.

       Not a huge gum fan, but the spouse likes it occasionally -- been trying to find gum without aspartame, it's nigh impossible! When did that happen? Little kids don't need to be consuming that stuff.

       The non-diet version of glee gum is safe but honestly it's expensive, nearly flavorless, and doesn't do much for bad breath. There are two UK studies that link migraine headaches in adolescent populations (in the UK) to gum chewing. One report concluded it was due to mastication fatigue of the lower jaw placing tension on the skull, and the other linked it to aspartame. Interestingly in both studies disuse for even a few hours reduced migraines in 60% of the cohorts. Apparently kids chew gum ALL day long. I was never a gum chewer but there ya have it. I do know that there are lots of sites devoted to all-natural living. There is a subreddit I goto a lot called r/simpleliving that has been helpful. One thing that has worked for me in general is asking myself Do I really need this "thing right now", and I also fanatically read labels. I know if you can grow it, or make it from scratch, you're better off 99% of the time. I personally find it really relaxing and therapeutic. The more people rejecting consumption the more difficult it will be for corporations and the MIC to poison our body and minds. It's not easy though. I just got dumped, I make a great living, and dating again I see how consumed people are with "stuff". And it's very lonely. Nobody wants to hear you preach about reducing, they just want you to be a means to things they want. Well what I want is kindness and respect and that's about it. I told that to two dates I had this past week. One told me to shut up. The other did a double take. That one pays 2400 a month to live in the Charlestown Navy yard. She told me, Lordofthegodkings, I finally make enough money to afford my lifestyle and you're going to tell me it's all for naught? I really offended her. Poor kid..

       One day they'll figure it out. It's hard and unpleasant to hear it when you're on the work-buy-work treadmill. Jumping off it is terrifying, too. My favorite comparison is having a $500+ molecular gastronomy type meal and comparing it to &lt;$10 Peruvian chicken on a spit and fried yuca with spicy aji sauce and realizing that for sheer happiness on all accounts, the chicken beats all--any day of the week. But damn, is that a tough and embarassing realization when you just dropped that much dough on

       I like Spry, comes in cinnamon, too. Can find it usually at co-ops and the like. Though sometimes I just do baking soda and coconut oil with tiny bit of peppermint oil. Baking soda &amp; peroxide are GREAT for whitening (and cheap!), but probably too tough on enamel to do often.

       Maybe online or if you've got a specialty food store (in the US, we have little co-ops or places like Whole Foods that tend to stock it). Auromere looks good to me, Spry has Xylitol and aloe, which is supposed to be helpful, but I'm not an expert in toothpaste ingredients. :)

       hard to do due to it being in many unexpected things, either naturally or unnaturally. i have been using non-fluoride toothpaste for many years and had zero (0) need to see a dentist. occasionally i get a slight tooth ache and it seems to fix itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr: my teeth are better w/o fluoride.

       I'm glad to hear this. I've been using fluoride free toothpaste (and we have well water &amp; a reverse osmosis filter) and I got a toothache the other day. I was afraid i'd have to go to the dentist. It resolved itself within 2 days.

       if you are in the uk Boots sell their own brand of fluoride free, £1.35ish or Holland and Barratt have a few different varieties some without SLS some with all natural ingredients but they cost 2x Boots, or more.

       The only fluoride i get comes from food and tea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tea drinkers should be aware that it has some of the highest levels of fluoride of any "natural" thing you can ingest.

       I found this out recently and its worrying because, being British, I drink copious amounts of tea. Luckily I live in area free from water fluoridation and I use a tea tree based toothpaste without fluoride.. but I'm shooting myself in the foot with the amount of tea I'm drinking. Bugger.

       Drinking things like barley tea and fiji water remove fluoride from your body naturally.   But dont over do it.  Too much and you can get kidney stones

       if you think about it, if our ancestors teeth all fell out before mid-twenties due to lack of fluoride and flossing i doubt many of us would be here now... so yes diet and perhaps the amount of vegetation and uncooked meat chewing they did back then probably had a similar action to brushing.
