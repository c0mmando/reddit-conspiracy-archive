    <div class="md"><p>No the connection is not directly related by the means of death. I&#39;m saying that Kevin Spacey plays a powerful figure in D.C. who is being investigated for criminal wrongdoing by a reporter. And when he discovers what that reporter knows and what her intentions are, he kills her and makes it looks like an accident. Drawing parallels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HofC is a very entertaining show with masterful photography, ambience, and a few quite great actors. </p>

<p>But it is a TV show, just that. Yes, it shows an unflattering view of Washington and politics but nothing any semi-informed viewer doesn&#39;t knows.</p>

<p>And when it comes to the plausibility of the plot... come on. Adding a few topical events &amp; characters (the hacking frame up and the black hat doing it because he has no choice, the blackmailing energy companies, sexual scandals) doesn&#39;t change the fact it is a fantasy, an unreal tale of how TWO persons manage to manipulate, fool and play the entire political system to suit their needs. Spacey is a great actor, but unless it&#39;s revealed that he&#39;s the Antichrist in season 03, it is all too unbelievable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, its just hard to get into the drama. I&#39;m like hyper aware that it was all planned out and written up by script writers with actors playing the parts of characters (usually) designed to appeal to a certain archetype of person, so the audience can relate and enjoy the show more. Since were in r/conspiracy, I also think that certain values are slipped in to sort of program the mind. </p>

<p>So, all in all, I try to avoid them, but I enjoy some. I&#39;m also a terrible person to take to the movies, lol</p>
