       I only just realised how big of an issue this was, UK based, so perhaps didn't notice the incident as much at the time.

       watch the Newtown cops dashcam footage of the parking lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       their cars are not parked exactly as the News12 (UAV drone) aerial footage shows on the day, the angles are different. similar but different.
      </p>
      <p>
       the dashcam footage shows the cops picnicking with tons of food placed on the hood of the cop car, they ate well that day.

      <p>
       and in the real world, how many people would want to eat and drink after twenty odd local kids had just been butchered, a bloodbath with twenty seven bodies and 150 plus bullets fired, blood and body tissue everywhere, doesn't make sense.

        Sandy Hook: Mind control flicker effect Dec20 by Jon Rappoport

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "What does this do to the audience who has been following the narrative on television? It sets up a flicker effect. An hour ago, it was suspect in the woods. Now, that bit of data is gone. On-off switch. It was on, now itâ€™s off.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a break in logic. It makes no sense.

       this short essay on how the MSM tells a story is well worth reading, explains how the technique works.
      </p>
      <p>
       it doesn't matter that a story is illogical and wrong, the story get adapted and morphed as it goes along, eventually an official story is constructed and that is the truth, no matter that it is likely complete BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       US national elections follow in a similar vein, some company is contracted (by the MSM) to tally and disseminate the total vote, their tally becomes the official vote and accepted outcome, no matter that the real votes can be obfuscated and twisted, once the moment the contracting vote company says X won, the parties accept it, that is it.

       That's simply not true. Those questions have been answered multiple times. They are horribly misleading and really show how unprofessional the person asking them is. Here is a link that is 3 months old. No idea why you are claiming no one will answer the questions.

       Halbig asks some simple deceptive questions, questions that if get answered correctly or incorrectly blow the hoax out the water. the whole Sandy Hook hoax gets exposed as the hoax it was.

       if they answer them they are damned, if they fail to answer them they are damned.

       forget the fancy over complex shite (who were the crisis actors, we know they used them, we know the kids are alive and older), its simple questions and answers that will get the legal wheels in motion.

       its like the greenscreen MSM footage, chronologically and logically impossible according to the official story.

       chasing rabbits down rabbit holes is what kept the 9/11 truthers disinfoed and running around in circles for twelve years, and made them look silly and ineffective in the eyes of the public.

       The attempt to "answer" the questions.  The failure of the state to enacted even basic mass casualty response.  Declaring all of the children.dead within 10 minutes of the bullets allegedly enterieng their bodies.  No death certificates.  And for me, most importantly, the school housed 500+ elementary age students.  With national news.cameras running, where are 500+ students and parents EVER seen?  They are not.

       That's just incorrect. From 10:00 to 10:03 on the police radio, you can hear them call for all available ambulances. That's 20 to 25 minutes after the shooting. That's also when 2 of the children were transported to Danbury Hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the police reports, paramedics checked each of the victims 4 times, including once with an EKG.

       How many different people did you count when you added up all the people from the different photos, videos, and aerial shots? It was surely hundreds. And most of the people were
       <em>
        inside
       </em>
       the firehouse. So ... I'm not sure where you're going with this.

       we saw a photo of one special ed class being
       <em>
        'evacuated'
       </em>
       from the drill the day or so before, theres the MSM photo then theres the other photo showing the parents and local journalists standing there watching the kids being

        'evacuated'

       both photos are MSM credited, the first is the common one, the other is on a MSM website too but only one or two places and obscure.

      <p>
       the woman on the far right is the 'mother' with the two kids that is seen hanging around down at the firehouse hours and hours later. still there at 5pm with her kids for the photo ops.

       Those photos were taken by Shannon Hicks of the tiny local weekly, the Newtown Bee:

       Maybe you could call that the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you say that one of the photos is a "special ed class" or a "drill".
      </p>
      <p>
       These are pictures of more children being evacuated than I have seen from any other school shooting. There are hundreds of other pictures and videos, too, from the firehouse. Did you expect them to all line up for a group shot?

       its a bit pointless to do so hours later or the next day. trauma victims have to be seen immediately, otherwise theres no point in bothering. they die on you before you get to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       and we know that EMTs and paramedics were not in the school on the morning of the 14th, the aerial video shows no EMTs there, they were ALL down at the firehouse or way down the parking lot playing triage with empty plastic sheets.

       They went into the school as soon as it was declared safe, just after 10AM. You can't see the paramedics inside the building from an aerial video.

       That was later. At 10:37, you can hear someone say for ambulances en route to proceed with traffic and to hold all other ambulances. Twelve ambulances arrived on scene, three of which transported patients. I'm not sure when the others were sent away.

       Operation 6 degrees aims to identify the names of everyone involved with a high profile event. Sometimes the same people are used in multiple events, which can make categorizing some people more difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prevailing theory is that the Sandy Hook shooting never happened, that kids never died, and the motive was gun control. After this hoax was exposed, people started questioning other incidents including the Port Arthur Massacre in Australia which was one of several high-profile shootings that helped grease the skids for gun control in Australia. Miraculously, there havent been any more high-profile shootings in Australia ever since the gun control agenda was accomplished
