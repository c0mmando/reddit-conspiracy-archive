<p>In the 90s and early 2000s things used to be different. Anyone else &quot;feel&quot; the difference?</p>

<p>Somehow, we have all undergone a Ï€/2 phase change in all 4 dimensions so that <strong>we moved to the stAin hexadectant, while our counterparts moved to our hexadectant (stEin)</strong>. <a href="http://woodbetweenworlds.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-berenstein-bears-we-are-living-in.html">Source</a></p>

<p>if we swapped with our pallel selves, I think the other universe is on a better path. top criminals were arrested and the world made the necessary choices earlier.</p>

<p>we&#39;re going down the &quot;harder&quot; path. our universe used to be on the good path in the 90s but somehow it&#39;s swapped. things are straight downhill form here and we&#39;ll all learn the same lessons but it just takes more time.</p>

<p>thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck, dude. This is some hardcore shit. I have had the same feelings (thoughts) as OP. I was a dumb fucker back in 2000 and perhaps this timeline is where I belong in order to get me out of my ignorance. </p>

<p>My theory: We are in the worse off of the two timelines. The other timeline has already phase shifted into the fifth dimension where time become irrelevant somehow. We are stuck here to learn lessons (the hard way, b/c we are the dumber), but the lessons that we are going to learn will lead to our obliteration when SHTF. Then we will have learned and be joining our (&quot;raptured&quot;) brethren (in &quot;death&quot;). </p>

Maybe you;re flickering between many different alternate realities and just happen to be picking a certain class. Like the nyquist frequency.

<p>It was BERENSTAIN then, and it is still BERENSTAIN now.  I don&#39;t give a shit what you people think you remember, it was always BERENSTAIN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, friends.  I propose this is a psychological test on the US population.  It was clearly &#39;Berenstein&#39; silently many gears ago.  Possibly through a reality less than of free agency and as it seems.  I digress, this rest is to find those who will still proclaim the <strong>known</strong> truth, even against the clear evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>Personally, k recall wrotongz coloring kHz and reading <strong>The Berenstein Bears</strong>.  This is straight insanity, yet I must stick with my position.  It&#39;s the motherfucking Berenstein motherfucking Bears...Berenstein bitch.  Til the day I die, I throw up that B and let that motherfucker linger.  An error or an exam.  Take your pic.</p>

<p>This is heavily related.  I&#39;m seeing a CRT slow moving reset wave hug the sphere.of the moon, changing its perceived position. One pixel right only as the &quot;reset&quot; wave progresses across point to point, curved.  The control structures are breaking down.  The cracks are much more frequently showing through.  We are all so much more than simple stardust. <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=4CCJxF7nIcM">http://youtube.com/watch?v=4CCJxF7nIcM</a></p>

<p><em>Be forwarned that one day it may alsoqbe you who is ...allllmost.... certain it was always *Berenstein</em>.

    <div class="md"><p>My argument with that is we recognize that the words are misspelled, even though we can read it. That recognition means we know the correct spelling. Berenstein was a tricky word for kids, so it wasn&#39;t a word everyone skimmed over. Kids wondered why it was spoken one way and spelled another, so in this process the majority remember an E. </p>
