    <div class="md"><p>If only most voted for an Independent (that is not compromised/a controlled opposition, if there&#39;s one).</p>

<p>Edit: Or at least voted for Ron Paul, he was by far the best of all the candidates from the two main parties, however I don&#39;t agree with him on some things. Paul wanted to slow down the MIC (Military Industrial Complex), end the ponzi-scheme and usury of fractional reserve banking of the Federal Reserve System, and live by the golden rule (treat people the way you&#39;d like to be treated), etc..</p>

<p>The Libertarian Party of the USA would&#39;ve been a good alternative,  however the Federal branch (but not all smaller branches (state, regional)) was highjacked by neo-cons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s allright. I do not believe it was staged either, not in the sense of &quot;staged&quot; as a theatrical play. Many people died. Though not &quot;staged&quot;, I think one has to be very gullible to believe the official story.</p>

<p>I assume you still strongly believe it was the works of terrorists?</p>

<p>I suggest you read up on the subject, there are hundreds of quircks that point to a cover-up, but let us just take one, out of the blue.  <a href="http://www.rense.com/general63/wtcc.htm">This article show pictures of one of the planes engine</a>, yet it does not come from a 767.  Nevermind that this engine is missing today. Now ask yourself, why would anyone want this false proof missing?</p>

<p>All these quircks and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_9/11_Commission">weird so-called &quot;investigation&quot;</a> that followed point to something being off in the official narrative.  </p>

<p>Either you have not heard too many details on these anomalies, or you shrug them all away. Either way, if you were the least bit curious you could of researched all this yourself, but sadly many people just trust blindly what comes out of their corporate controlled, government  sponsored news bulletin. They have no reason not to trust.</p>

<p>Sorry, I have this thing I like to do and it is called thinking, and I have come to the conclusion that governments are not our friends but act on behalf of corporate interests, the military complex is the most powerful &quot;branch&quot; of government and they are not above this for a multi-trillion dollar war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before their was nation-state there was the land of your birth.   The land of your birth is not an intellectual construct,  it is the dirt that you grew out of.</p>

<p>With the invention of the nation-state,  some of the features of religion,  corporate identity specifically,  became part of belonging to a group of people who were supposed to agree on the terms of their association.    Social contract and all.   If you don&#39;t believe the way you are supposed to you don&#39;t belong.</p>

<p>Being Italian,  you can believe most anything,   but to be American,  you are supposed to believe the the main precepts of America,  &quot;freedom&quot;,   &quot;equality&quot;,  &quot;justice for all&quot;,   but you MUST,  its not a choice.   If you fail on this,  you are not a proper American,  and you really don&#39;t belong here,  because this place is just for proper Americans.</p>

<p>Yeah,  its an oversimplification,  but the nation-state has ushered in a new kind of entity that has a lot more associated ideals than just &quot;place of birth&quot;,  or place of my home.   Humans have laid on an extra level of belief with this.    I consider it borderline religion.    </p>

<p>Monarchies were a lot older,  lasted a lot longer,  were supposedly appointed by God,   but that was in a pre-literate age where loyalty was to something you could mostly see,  not as much a concept.    But the drift towards conceptual loyalties,  beliefs,  has been on for a long,  long time.   Its just getting more and more sophisticated.    Until people reach the point of cynicism and skepticism and doubt,  which is happening.    Maybe something else than the nation-state is about to happen.   Something with more of a tribal feeling,   but global?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend Nicaragua because the government taxes by the area size of business and advertising signs.  So I think that everyone has the right there to have an index card size advertisement for a business but that is about it and so everyone does business by word of mouth and that leads to funny shit like everyone trying to be a middle man for everything whereas in the US I would just give a stranger my mechanics number and be done with it whereas they&#39;ll try to get involved to get some kind of commission on nearly anything.  Then neon signs!, forget about it.  Its the material cost of the sign relative to what can be generated plus the government taxing up the ass for it.  Its so fucking nice not to really ever see flashing neon signs like that Tool song conveys.  Flush it all away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Patriotic fanatism does that. The american illusion is still strong enough to blind people when it comes to consider that the country might actually have committed national mass-murder; the same country that is filled with corruption, lies, constitutional violations, breach of international laws, invading other countries based on WMD lies, guilty of war crimes, mass tortures, tried to stage a very similar scenario in the past, etc.</p>

<p>For those the country is ok with all of those problems, but staging 9/11? Hell no, america would never do such thing, not in a million years! And anyone that talks like that can only be a terrorist and should be killed.</p>

<p>PS: That&#39;s the same country that was and still is funding Al Qaeda, the same organization that is &quot;allegedly&quot; responsible for 9/11. It&#39;s like the entire country is composed of Bill O&#39;Reillys.</p>

<p>I started digging into the list of names one day, randomly grabbed several names from the middle of the pile and dug in. To my surprise, the digging was rather shallow. Most of these &quot;victims&quot; have almost no biography beyond being on a victim list.</p>

<p>Oh boy, here we go. Some people are just too overzealous about questioning <em>every</em> little thing, I guess.</p>

<p>What are you suggesting? That all the very real people who worked at the World Trade Center were told to stay home that day? That the hundreds of people who would have been there on any given day simply ...weren&#39;t?</p>

<p>All the videos and photographs of bodies burned, crushed, in free-fall from hundreds of feet in the air - are you suggesting dummies? Robots? A massive project involving a highly-skilled team of visual effects and Photoshop artists sworn to secrecy? Where the hell could you possibly go with this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP here. Thanks for the responses to this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 33 years old and was just yelled at by my dad like I haven&#39;t been since I was a teenager. I mean, he is <em>furious</em> that I dare to question the official story. And he even agrees that most of &quot;politics&quot; is a fraud!!</p>

<p>It absolutely breaks my heart that so much of the world is so deceived and yet so angry at those who are trying to open their eyes. It kills me inside. I can&#39;t take this world. Some days I just want to say &quot;Fuck all y&#39;all.&quot; Other days I want to plead for them. I pray that God will open their eyes as He did mine. I&#39;m drowning in lies and deception and it&#39;s a struggle to keep my head up. Thanks again. Though not by mortal men, I believe we will be vindicated in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think that a fear to be associated with a person who questions the official story or makes &quot;outlandish&quot; statements is also playing a bit of a part here. I talked to a close friends of mine once about this and even though we had disagreements in the past, our friendship had never been in jeopardy. One day in class I mentioned that I believed it was a conspiracy and of course got the usual hate. But instead of making a logical argument my friend started jokingly ( not really ) calling me crazy, idiot and saying we weren&#39;t friends. I think had it just been us the situation would have been much different however it appeared that due to an audience who could possibly judge him in a negative light he chose to distance himself from the controversial opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had the rug pulled out from under me countless times.  After some beers I let my words go easier and so some people have associated me being drunk with being crazy or weird because they can&#39;t handle the concepts that I express.  Almost entirely I find these types of people like to clump up in large groups of several people or more whereas I tend to go solo or with at most two friends.  I almost never have the same contrived ethos as a large group of people.  I&#39;m living in Ukraine now and I have over an American couch surfer who lived as a train hopping hobo for nine months.  That is my kind of conversation and it is far more colorful than the dull gray of some preening ten person group vying for the group normalcy award.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but aren&#39;t you prejudiced and ignorant right now? He didn&#39;t mention anything about the christian god or religion at all, but you attacked him &#39;personally&#39; as if he worshipped your straw man evil god or religion. </p>

<p>It seems you don&#39;t even have a clue about his &#39;god&#39; at all, whatsoever. Yet you have already rejected it, and expect others to naturally realize this as well. What if his god was the embodiment of the eternal source of life as a concept, how can you outright reject that? You know, the pure energy that exists in these planes, take on different forms and can never be destroyed. You are just projecting your ignorance. </p>

<p>But if you&#39;re talking about a personal god watching over you as a guardian, sure, that&#39;s kinda childish.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not religious in the traditional sense, but I try to be open minded about others people belief, and take away what good I can from everyone I meet regardless of spirituality or religion. Personally I&#39;ve had great success with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people automatically assume you&#39;re referring to organized religion as soon as they hear the word &quot;god&quot;. It&#39;s probably the most ambiguous term in the English language, as it can mean almost anything from person to person.

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. Yes, I think it all comes back to the fact that words don&#39;t have inherent meaning, but rather have meaning applied to them by humans, which creates confusion when there&#39;s 6 billion viewpoints. </p>

<p>The world we experience individually is a mirror of our subjective perspective or consciousness, which is what makes the diversity on this planet so awesome. I guess you could say we are a collective consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. That is not to say there is not an raw objective reality, its just that we(or me really) can&#39;t experience it without the fragile human mind getting in the way. </p>

<p>Besides, we would probably freak out if we could see the universe for the raw energy that it is, instead of this optical illusion we create for ourselves. </p>

<p>What they fail to understand is that the bad guys who did 9/11 are not the ones we are told did it and the real bad guys still run things.

<p>It&#39;s brought about in the same manner - indoctrination from a young age. In this case, they believe their government always acts in their best interest, although often incompetently, but would certainly never willingly do anything that would cause such a tragedy against its own citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People just won&#39;t believe that our government would do that to us. I&#39;m only 15 and people call me crazy for believing this so called conspiracy. I&#39;ve done my research and my research tells me that the United States government staged 9/11. There&#39;s cops and firemen who said they heard explosions in the towers, like a controlled demolition. How did WTC 7 fall from just debris all random about it? Unless it was a controlled demolition. Where did most of the plane end up at the Pentagon? It looked more like a missile than anything else. And at Shanksville, where the hell was the plane, and I&#39;m no mathematician, but I&#39;m pretty sure a plane would make a bigger hole than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it possible that it&#39;s because substantial evidence of a horrific oversight by the bush admin is the cause? Is it also possible that everyone else isn&#39;t the ones who are wrong? Honestly, it&#39;s the truthers who truly have no concept of what is reputable information and it&#39;s less we are offended by your beliefs and more that we immediately lose respect for you for being stupid enough to buy into a considerable amount of hearsay. It&#39;s how you value info from totally ignorant youtubers more than actual well sourced information to draw conclusions.</p>

<p>Literally every single piece of &quot;evidence&quot; for the staged theory is very VERY definitively disproven. You should be spending less of your life trying to convince others of absurd assumptions and maybe be more interested in being pissed off that an administration ignorantly let 3000 people die from oversight then proceeded to use the catastrophe to grandstand and let them to do all the stupid shit they wanted.</p>

<p>The bullshit afterwards to me is what is the worst part. It happened because of ignorance and then the dumbass responsible got voted back in by taking advantage of how blind some people can be. We still feel the pain of what the bush administration was permitted to do today. That&#39;s truth, verifiable, honest, Truth.</p>

<p>I could talk about this all day but how about a TLDR.</p>

<p>TLDR: Maybe you folks need to learn how to be more critical of what you get your info from and not blame us for not buying into the same bullshit you do so happily do as long as it fits into your world view.</p>

Even if it was haulted, it was probably pushed further underground, expanded ten-fold, and given a new name (such as how MK-ULTRA was found out (and is now public knowledge (thanks to some FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests))), and is speculated that a new program, &quot;Project Monarch&quot;, to have replaced MK-ULTRA.</p>

<p>Could it be that the US knew in advance and allowed it to happen... sure ok, I will entertain that thought. But the idea of elaborate plans involving planted explosives really beg credibility and have no shred of evidence. When I say no shred of evidence, btw, I am not talking about video reviews of the collapse either. What I have failed to see from anyone is a reconstructed timeline of events detailing how hundred of people brought in explosives and planted them, how all these people were kept quiet, by what agencies were they hired, and how did the local authorities just allow it all to happen?</p>

<p>Now in science it is very difficult to prove almost anything, but these are some articles that support the notion that fires can cause steel structures to collapse. Unfortunately these articles are behind a paywall, but if you have the educational background to properly evaluate these articles you shouldn&#39;t have much of a problem viewing them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002954931300472X">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002954931300472X</a>

<p>Here are a couple articles about collisions of planes into concrete buildings. I&#39;m sure there are more relevant articles elsewhere. However, I don&#39;t find it difficult to understand that the engines and aluminum wings will break apart when colliding with concrete at high speeds. Its not like they evaporated. There are pictures of engine parts in the pentagon. I don&#39;t think this is a good argument because it seems like it would be really easy for the government to place aircraft debris that they calculated would likely be left over from a crash into the pentagon. If it was so far fetched that engines would break apart on impact then they would just place mostly intact engines into the pentagon before or after their alleged attack. I would trust calculations made by the government (if they did the attacks themselves) over what I believe would happen based on zero calculations or experience with aircraft flying into concrete structures.</p>

<p>Lastly, asking for peer reviewed articles that &quot;scientifically&quot; prove coincidences is a little ridiculous. I think the least likely date that the government would run a drill of an event they planned to carry out would be the day of the event itself. Also, if the government runs many drills involving any of the scenarios related to the 9/11 attacks (hijackings, pentagon attacks, terrorist attacks, skyscraper attacks, building fires, war games, etc.) then it isn&#39;t much of a coincidence at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only picture of an engine at the pentagon was, from what I understand, the one that Boeing stated was not a part of any of their planes. And their were no wings pictured, or scarring of the building where the wings would have hit.<br/>
Thanks for the articles, I will give them a read.<br/>
But yeah look into it.  NORAD and the FAA had a joint drill on Sept 11. At the same time the planes were hijacked.  In the drill 5 imaginary planes were added to radar flight control screens and reported as &quot;hijacked&quot;.  The imaginary planes disappears from the screens around the same time that the actual planes transponders were deactivated.  Im just going by memory here but look up operation vigilant guardian sometime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, I believe that 9/11 happened almost exactly as we saw it, just that the government knew something was coming, but they underestimated the damage the terrorists could inflict.  There is ample evidence that a lot of people all over the government knew those goat fuckers were up to something. In my opinion the Cheney cabal of think tank neo-cons felt that a terror attack would do much to usher in the changes they wanted to increase our military might to the point that no other nation or group of nations would be able to challenge our global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#.22New_Pearl_Harbor.22">hegemony</a>.  There is just too much smoke there to not have any fire behind it The original document titled &quot;rebuilding America&#39;s defenses&quot;, I think, that was their mein kampf, but that has been scrubbed off the web and the WayBackMachine so unless anyone has a .pdf of that letter saved you are going to have a hard time finding it.  You add that goofy shit with Bush only testifying before the 9/11 commission so long as Cheney was present, and that it not be under oath, I mean wtf guy?!?!  Its all about who&#39;s conspiracy theory you want to believe. The government says a bunch of goat fuckers living in caves with dirt fucking floors, was able to plan a multi year multi million dollar conspiracy involving hundreds of people on multiple continents against the most advanced nation on earth. Or you can think that just maybe those assholes who fraudulently took over the government via <em>Bush v. Gore</em> might have decided to allow them to do it, figuring, based on past attacks that such an attack most likely would be botched and have a limited number of casualties. So this makes me a truther I guess, but I think it is the most plausible explanation I know of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every now and again well I feel like abusing my brain and making myself dumber for the experience I head on over to debunking911.com and read the fucking absolute bullshit lies that are writen there. As a short example, head on over to the page titled, &quot;The fallacy of freefall.&quot; where this gem can be found</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me make this clear, I don&#39;t assume to know what the ACTUAL fall time was. Anyone telling you they know is lying</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you know, these things can be measured from the videos. NIST agrees with the 9/11 truth movement that building 7 did fall at free fall acceleration for a portion of it&#39;s collapse and the rate of acceleration of the collapsing towers one and two is also not a matter of dispute between proponents of the 9/11 truth version of events and the official government story. Why does this blog bother with saying that we cannot know what the acceleration of the collapsing buildings were when neither side of this argument claim this.  It is total and utter bullshit aimed at confusing you and making a very simple concept seem difficult to grasp. NIST and the 9/11 truth movement believe that building 7 fell at free fall acceleration for a portion of its collapse. NIST and the 9/11 truth movement both believe the implication of this fact is that absolutely no structural elements of building 7 existed to slow the collapse of building 7. NIST claims this is because of a theory of a mechanism of collapse that is totally novel and completely unheard of before in the history of engineering, yet they refuse to release the data and assumptions on which they base this finding. Perhaps you could point us to the page of debunking911.com where they publish the data NIST won&#39;t. Until that happens sites like debunking911.com are exactly the kind of lying pices of shit that they appear to be to anybody who has even the most basic highschool understanding of things such as acceleration, force, and mass.</p>

<p>And if you think that is harsh well to bad. You did ask what we thought of sites like that and now you know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to respectfully disagree with everything you just said.  The &quot;unsupported&quot; belief that some people in our own government had to have been involved in the attacks, has WAY more proof than any of the &quot;official&quot; stories about what happened.<br/>
The investigation by &quot;thousands&quot; of &quot;professional&quot; investigators you speak of, was actually a commission of 10 people, 5 democrats, 5 republicans. They were politicians, not experts. and they all had ties to the very people who we accuse of being involved.  Imagine if your son was murdered, and they let the main suspect choose the people who get to investigate him.  bit of a conflict of interest.  Not to mention the nation had already convicted Bin Laden within the day, way before any investigation had occurred.
I agree we shouldn&#39;t support dictators, but the people who have started wars based on 911 have been spreading sharia law and drug production in the countries we toppled.  Also your argument here is invalidated by the story you claim to believe, because it was never an evil &quot;dictator&quot; who attacked us.  Lastly judging by the actions our government and media have taken following sept 11, the idea that more scrutiny on these agencies would be &quot;damaging&quot; to the country, is insane.  Your arguments lead me to believe that you are either a knowing accomplice to the disinformation agenda, or are grossly misinformed about the facts of 911.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By &quot;investigators&quot;, I meant FBI, NYPD, NTSB, etc.  Probably also DOD, CIA, NSA, etc.  Not the 10 commission members.</p>

<p>Sure, it wasn&#39;t a dictator who attacked us, it was people motivated to attack us because we support dictators or regimes in their countries.</p>

<p>More scrutiny of govt actions and agencies would be a good thing.  Maliciously undermining civil discourse and attitudes toward facts and govt and media for no good reason damages the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right so if they were investigating this like it was an actual crime scene (which being the biggest crime scene ever on US soil, they should have been)  why did stuff like <a href="http://www.bollyn.com/who-sold-the-911-steel-for-scrap/">this</a> happen?  </p>

<p>Okay now quick question about the investigation.  How long did it take to find the identity of the unibomber?  I mean he was number one on the FBI&#39;s most wanted list. He evaded investigators for 17 years.  Now those same investigators had a full list of everyone involved in the 9-11 attacks within 5 days of the attack?  What evidence did they have?  How could they have gathered this evidence so quickly without knowing exactly where to look for it.  I assume in reality they knew who to blame because they were in on it, or more likely they went through the flight manifestos and picked out some names that sounded &quot;Muslim-ey&quot;.   The NYPD wouldn&#39;t have investigated this, it was a federal case. (any members of the NYPD feel free to correct me on this if you were part of an investigation.)  As for the intelligence community, that goes back to my argument about having the prime suspect of a crime, investigating his involvement in the crime.
So now you claim to know the motivations of the &quot;terrorists&quot; who attacked us?  They got us because we haven&#39;t yet gone to their country and killed their leaders?  I thought GWB said they hate us because of our freedom?  I thought that was why he signed the patriot act, to get rid of that freedom, so that the scary terrorists wouldn&#39;t hate us so much.  But now your telling me it was all because our government supports... who exactly?  anyone willing to secure american financial hegemony by bending over and accepting the petrol-dollar?That&#39;s why they hate us?   I guess your right, it makes perfect sense that Al-Qaeda (Islamic anti-socialist proponents of sharia law) would attack america for our governments support of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia (Islamic anti-socialist proponent of sharia law)  This argument makes no sense.  I don&#39;t claim to know the motivations of those who committed the attacks, but I can see from the aftermath those who benefited from the attacks. 
And I agree, sewing discourse &quot;for no good reason&quot; is a bad thing.  But blindly ignoring facts, physics, science, and logic, while believing everything you are told by a group of people who have every reason in the world to lie to you, is suicide.  The ones who damage the country are the people running the country.  They have you so brainwashed that you believe it to be &quot;Malicious&quot; to investigate their crimes.  </p>

<p>P. S. I live in New York, I watched it fucking happen. It was horrifying, and please don&#39;t suggest that it was anything other than what it was: a horrible tragedy for my city, and my nation. Furthermore, in the US, it&#39;s pretty much guaranteed to be a touchy subject, and prompt a decidedly not positive reaction. Finally, just be safe, and don&#39;t bring the fucking subject up with anyone that lived in New York that awful day. You may be talking to someone who lost a loved one, and that is just not cool, to really talk about or mention their horrible, firey or cancerey or just unpleasant and early demise.</p>

I spent years looking at the empty skyline. I watched the new World Trade Center go up floor by floor. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AEQC9Pw.png">I see it from my window every single day.</a> </p>

<p>I lost people. All of my friends lost people too. I have had the time and experience to understand how this issue is the explosive result of a combination of factors.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>9/11 is a very taboo subject. Most people don&#39;t like to talk about it, and the attacks&#39; subsequent onslaught of political grandstanding indoctrinated the general population into a deeply emotional sense of unified patriotism. So even suggesting an alternative to the official narrative everybody has been parroting for years is tantamount to siding with the Taliban in their skewed, weak-minded perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>Stupid people are just plain threatened by a notion that contradicts their perceptions. They were given a very easy &quot;conclusion&quot; to reach. They have latched onto that version of reality because they find it palatable. They are deeply frightened by the possibility that the belief they rely on to bring them peace of mind might be wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>They have long since jumped on the self-indulgent bandwagon of disparaging conspiracy theorists. Again, you have to understand that the general population is very <strong>very VERY</strong> stupid. They are extremely desperate to feel a sense of superiority, and looking down on conspiracy theorists is extremely gratifying to them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Understand that all of these factors are by the design of the people in control. They are the result of a massive, intricate, and deeply rooted propaganda campaign by powerful people who stand to gain from a country that functions as ours has for the better part of a century. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems pretty simple to me. We&#39;re indoctrinated from a very young age to believe we&#39;re the &quot;good guys&quot;. </p>

<p>Every cartoon, every television show, every movie ends with the good guys winning. It&#39;s confirmation of what we believe in the pit of our souls, that while we may not be perfect per say, at least our intentions are good. At least we&#39;re not &quot;the bad guy&quot;.  </p>

<p>For Joe Citizen, the idea that elements within our own government would or could organize something so monstrous for the sake of empire is simply unfathomable. It rubs against the indoctrination they&#39;ve been subjected to their entire lives.  </p>

<p>Earlier in this thread <a href="/u/rockytimber">/u/rockytimber</a> made a great analogy: Saying &quot;your government was responsible for 9/11&quot; ticks the exact same triggers as &quot;your mother is a whore&quot;. It may be true, but who the fuck wants to believe it, even if it&#39;s true?</p>

<p>Absolutely correct.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>The truth is that the only people who get mad when you suggest 9/11 is staged are people on the internet who have an agenda.  I&#39;ve never had anyone in real life even really question me when I say 9/11 was a false flag, this despite the fact that so many of my friends and family are not conspiracy theorists and the fact that I bring it up everytime someone asks me if I am a conspiracy theorist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vote brigade much? </p>

<p>You and your asshat friends at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> just can&#39;t stand it can you!? Cowards never fight fair. </p>

<p>Did you just link me to debunking911 as proof of the official story!??! Oh this will be good. </p>

<p>While I appreciate the lengthy and verbose efforts, the fact remains, <strong>Saying things are proof and evidence does not make them so</strong> </p>

<p>Some highlights for me on the building 7 page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we don&#39;t have...</p>

<p>1) Clear view of the large hole</p>

<p>2) <strong>Number of columns and location of columns taken out by the tower impact</strong></p>

<p>3) Clear view of all the fires seen on the south side</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To put it simply, <strong>the building DID fall over backward</strong> and to the south-east. Just not like a steel reinforced concrete building would.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let me get this straight, the building fell over backward now?</p>

<p>In all of that nonsense they don&#39;t once mention that according to NIST the building was in free fall acceleration for 2.25 seconds nor do they attempt to reconcile how that could be possible in a closed system suffering a progressive collapse that was initiated by asymmetrical damage caused by fire alone. </p>

<p>I&#39;m interested to hear your thoughts on how this is possible?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll thank you to remind your friends not to vote brigade. </p>
