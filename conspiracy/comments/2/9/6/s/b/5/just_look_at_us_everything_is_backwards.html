       And we wouldn't end up that way if we all came together and helped one another...but we've been indoctrinated to see one another as different, so we are weak and dependent upon the state and the elite running the state.  Yet the elite and the state have literally
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       had our best interest in mind.  Ever.

      <p>

       That's it.  We are cattle to them.

       and so long as we continue staying apart and separated from one another, we will remain cattle.

       Our only hope is to come together and help each other outside of their influence.

       They might not go down quietly, but they would go down VERY alone if the slaves they use to do all their work (i.e.
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       - we the people) weren't on their side any longer to help implement their enslaving rule and were, instead, on each other's side as one human family.

      <p>
       It seems shit is indeed on its way toward hitting the fan, but - again - we as a people have unfortunately forgotten the power and ability we have if we but all come together.  The elite cannot compete with that.  Simple as that.  If we were to do that, then we
       <em>
        wouldn't

       have anywhere near as difficult a time as many think.

       And that's our own fault because we continue agreeing to play their little shitty, enslaving game(s).  We wouldn't be stuck holding

       Unfortunately the level of cooperation and trust required for your scenario to occur is unrealistic.  If the means of production stopped, and food wasn't on the shelves, and medicine ran out, and police ganged up, gangs ganged up, and internet service was stopped, you would not see the kume bi yah coming together of citizens.

       It would certainly
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       that it would be difficult, of course.  However, the reason why it would be unrealistic is simply because we've all been so brainwashed BY tptb to see each other as different based on all these faux teachings they've indoctrinated into this civilization:  Religious and class division, ethnic and racial divides, social stratifications, etc, etc. are designed to keep us apart - but they're all bullshit, artificial divides that don't actually exist in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really all bullshit, and if enough/all of us realize this, then our coming together as the one people that we are independent of all these contrived differences WOULD be possible and wouldn't be all that unrealistic at all actually.

       That's total and complete bullshit talking right there, man.  You say what you said here, why?  You say that because that's what TPTB have
       <em>
        indoctrinated
       </em>
       into you by all the tv and movies and MSM bullshit that we've been watching from birth and that show and tell us that "everything would be chaos!" if we didn't have fucking big brother watching over and controlling us, telling us what to do.  That's, again, just total bullshit.  It doesn't
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to be like that actually.  That's not like some "necessary law" of society that if we're not kept down by police force and/or whips and chains that we'd be wild, savage animals and things would just turn into "complete chaos".  No way, man.

       The people together could run it.  Communal organization and communal self-leadership could do it.  Would it be easy?  Of course not.  However, it's not like we don't have it in us to do something like this.  I know this because I know
       <strong>
        I
       </strong>
       have it in me, and I'm not different than you or anyone else, so we

       Nothing would crumble if there is, again, organization, responsibility, and effort put in by everyone.  You don't need some "lone leader" telling you what to do.  And if you/we do, then why oh why on Earth does ANYONE
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       get upset or offended when we're called Sheeple?  This is EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE if we can't figure out how to come together, be responsible, and run ourselves properly.  WTF? lol  Damn.

       The fact that I have kept saying over and over again that it wouldn't be easy should serve as at least SOME indication to you that I'm not "naive" enough to think it would be cherry blossoms and roses all the way, bro.

       Not necessarily in the least.  Again, communal cooperation can mitigate any and all factors, as it's not like we're not being able to function properly now under THIS shitty system we live in.  There's no reason we can't continue on but WITHOUT all the manipulation and bullshit involved.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom — Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.

       People or shall I say sheeple are easily predicted.

      <p>
       Obviously when things are going good, you don't hear a peep, except from some of us so called
       <em>
        conspiracy theorist
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But all of a sudden when the children don't get their way they want to have temper tantrums.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know what?  It's all a show, because if everything were to change they would revert right back to their closed minded, following orders way of existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one, I am a bit happy not for the suffering no, but for the fact people are being forced to see what the world is truly about.  To see you can only leech off others for only so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us not even consider talking about the other diabolical behaviors that go on behind the scenes with the supposed elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The millions of children that go missing every year, not to crime, not to sex trade, not to slavery, but just disappear out of the world with no trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's a conspiracy most aren't ready for.

       I'll grant you that some are on the right side of the fight. Unfortunately, they don't seem to be making much progress cleaning up that cesspool of greed and corruption that is the US government. More unfortunately, they are the only ones who can anymore, since the voters' voice has been muted by big money.
