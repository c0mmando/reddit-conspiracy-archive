        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I often find myself worried about when the state of the world might see a change for the better. I&#39;m sure many of you here feel the same way, that we are stuck in a globalist war machine, and we don&#39;t know how we might work to change the world for better.</p>

<p>The answer may lie in a theory put out by British author and lecturer, Sir John Glubb. He viewed some of the largest empires in recorded history and studied the approximate length of how long they were in power. The average cycle is around 250 years per empire, some more some less. </p>

<p>So here we are, 238 years into what we could call the US Empire. Certainly not as pronounced as other empires, but that&#39;s because we know well the US Empire works in covert dealings and shady tactics. So we may not own countries across the world like the British Empire had presence Africa and Asia, but we have most definitely been intervening in foreign governments for a good amount of time. Before the Cold War we were primarily concerned with Latin American countries, like Cuba, Panama, Nicaragua, Haiti and Chile. As we moved into the Cold War era and with the rise of the CIA, surveillance, and overthrowing governments, replacing leaders with ones more geared for benefit for the US. I rant a bit here, most of us know all this already. We are reaching a point of extreme pressure though. Mass surveillance, verge of global war, globalist NWO agendas, corporate power overriding governmental power, federal law preempting state law, police brutality at an all time high, the masses are buying into media bias. Our country is kind of a shit hole right now, and it feels like almost like a curse to be so painfully aware of the atrocities committed by our bank masters. But I firmly believe we are approaching the beginning of the destruction of these outdated, cruel, inept, unsustainable paradigms. </p>

<p>I have one more theory to bestow upon you. I know that many of you here will discredit me the moment I mention Astrology, but there is a very significant astrological correspondence that lines up with the 250 year empire theory. Pluto in Capricorn. I have been dabbling into researching occult history, astrology, secret societies and all the jazz associated with it for a fair amount of time. There was a time where astrology and astronomy were one and the same, the stars have pointed out cycles and patterns in earth history and human development since the beginning of time. Our most ancient ancestors evolved because they could recognize the changing patterns in the sky.</p>

<p>That being said, Pluto represents a planet of inner searching, transformation, and regeneration. Capricorn represents planning, stability, growth, and order. So when Pluto enters Capricorn, it represents very strong, opposing forces. And for you skeptics, here are a few periods in history that were influenced under Pluto in Capricorn</p>

<p>532-551 AD: Nika revolts in Greece due to political upheaval. Bubonic plague first outbreak in Eastern Roman Empire. Heavy cooling in northern atmosphere and mass starvation</p>

<p>1269-1287 AD: Wars between Mongols, Japan, and China. Last Moorish settlement defeated. 3 Popes died during this time frame.</p>

<p>1515-1532 AD: Martin Luther divides the Christian Church. Aztec Empire is conquered as well as the Inca Empire. First Pacific crossing, and many other navigational innovations came about at the time.</p>

<p>1762-1778 AD: Rousseau&#39;s &quot;Social Contract&quot; was written in this time, which of course led to the Revolutionary War (and the beginning of the French Revolution). Steam engine, submarine, flush toilet, and the electric telegraph were invented at this time. </p>

<p>These are pretty brief descriptions of events at the time, but they all fit the theme of Pluto in Capricorn. Of course there are many other astrological aspects occurring all the time that influence these events as well. </p>

<p>And now we come to Pluto in Capricorn between 2008-2023. What themes have we seen in world events since then? The market collapse of 2008 was right on cue for Pluto entering Capricorn. Continuing intervention in Middle Eastern countries, while government corruption is becoming more apparent to the public eye. We have seen a pretty big increase in whistleblowers. The NSA revelations are obviously a pretty big wake up call for a lot of people around the world. We are fighting a new fight for internet neutrality against the TPP. The Ukraine crisis has set the US and Russia at the most dangerous standoff since the Cold War. </p>

<p>But we cannot be afraid. Life has moved on every time Pluto passes through Capricorn, this just happens to be difficult cycle for human development. However, if you want to know what the other side looks like astrologically, it promises to get better. After Pluto leaves Capricorn it enters Aquarius, where themes of rebuilding, technological growth, progressive thought and revolution. It will be better geared for the masses than the individual, as the global elite will likely use this time of Pluto in Capricorn to carry out their malicious wishes. They won&#39;t be able to get away with as much in the future. But again these are the ramblings of someone who has looked as deep as he could to find hope for the future. I don&#39;t care whether or not this post is popular, I just hope this can be a way for some people to realize that we are approaching a time where we will start to see a more positive change. We are much too focused on the doom here, even though I&#39;ll admit that Pluto in Capricorn has been a time where the dread of doom is known by everyone. </p>

<p>Rest easy my friends, better days await us. I don&#39;t promise any fortune telling with astrology, I simply use it to fact check the outer workings of the macrocosm in relation to earth events. I find it fascinating and hope you do to. Have faith that we can build a better future, but also know that the Universe is on our side. The US will fall, globalists and zionists will perish, and our shackles of economic and social enslavement will be broken with them.</p>

<p>what you&#39;re seeing here is a pattern of your own making. its not too difficult to cherry pick events and line them up with astrological moments. all that aside, it is quite clear we are in the &quot;end times&quot; of american hegemony. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, I was never arguing against that point you made. If anything, I just added how the American Empire can be seen as starting at the end of the Spanish-American War. </p>

<p>As to your reply to the OP, the part which you quoted, could be true. Being able to follow the patterns in the sky is a huge advantage compared to human populations that have not discovered said patterns.</p>

<p>People find patterns in things, and want to share their findings with others. Peer review is what we are actively doing. Lets not shoot down ideas but rather work with them until no longer valid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not quibbling with you either as 16 years means little and while we could debate the minutiae of that point in its unimportant to the larger argument. as far as the op astrological points, correlation does not imply causation. and he is off on some of the happenings he cites in the time periods he calls out. so as far as being &quot;influenced by pluto in capricorn&quot; perhaps it is better said these things happened to occur. bad things happen all the time, i do my best to work for good</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on about the 16 years matter. Correlation does not imply causation, but god damn it can be the beginnings of a research. </p>

<p>His theory could still hold, until we find out what drove people to commit to decisions that led to the events OP described. Whether astrology is real or not, is not what matters to the theory OP is postulating. What matters is, that decisions of leaders can be influenced by the movements of stars and the planets, they said leaders are followers/believers of astrology. </p>

<p>I think it was u/axolotl_peyotl who said something along these lines...</p>

<p>We do not study astrology/occultism/satanism/luceferianism to gain a understanding of the religion,but rather we study to understand what factors are played into decision making by people who actually do believe in these things. </p>

<p>This sub does not like to dismiss these types of ideas because as a whole, the sub knows the influence religion has on people&#39;s decisions.</p>

<p>I hope this made sense, and god damn! Its always fun having a nice discussion on here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Astrology is an interesting cultural artifact, a way of incorporating myth into a reality. </p>

<p>I find it interesting that you reduce your argument to the notion that you can&#39;t believe that 2+2 can equal 5, yet with simple group theory, you can formalize an algebra so that very idea is fact.</p>

<p>Human beings have a highly symbolic intelligence, and symbols are everywhere. Dismissing the past discoveries of human beings about the nature of reality based on your own misapprehensions, cognitive dissonance, and plain ignorance means you are no better than those who seek reassurance for the meaningfulness of their lives in a daily astrology column.</p>

<p>Life without poetry isn&#39;t living. The science of turning lead into gold was a metaphor for man achieving his highest self. People believing the earth was flat is not a historical reality, just a story we tell ourselves to pretend that we know more than other civilizations. And as geo-centrism, just look to ego-centrism.So while the fact may have changed, the drive is still there. It&#39;s the same drive that animates your belligerence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t get my 2+2 analogy?  Wow.  I need to stop discussing this with you.  My point was that I have the &quot;narrow-minded&quot; view that 2+2=4.

It was an illustrative example taken to an extreme to show your absurdity.  Of course it&#39;s not a claim you made - this is called argumentation.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a bad analogy, in my opinion.  You&#39;re comparing a mathematical constant to an entire field of science (and yes, astrology was traditionally a science in almost all cultures prior to modern times).  There is no possibility that 2+2 can ever equal anything but 4.  Not sure how you can say that there&#39;s no possibility that the study of astrology can have merit, especially when it&#39;s obvious you&#39;ve never done any research of your own on the subject (by virtue of the fact that you think reading a &quot;local astrology column&quot; is what I&#39;m referring to - it isn&#39;t).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  I feel sorry for anyone who has their mind made up before even attempting to broach a subject.  How do you know astrology has no merit, by the way?  Is it because someone told you it didn&#39;t?  You don&#39;t even seem to know what &quot;astrology&quot; entails.</p>

<p>Unless you happen to be working in base 3 or base 4, where it equals 11 and 10 respectively. The important thing to keep in mind is that the symbols have been altered without the underlying meaning being altered. Astrology provides the appearance of being scientific, and therefore provides the appearance of a closed mind beyond strict empiricism in those who reject it, just as &quot;2+2 always equals 4&quot; can provide the appearance of a closed mind when one is armed with the knowledge of changing bases.</p>

<p>No, not like any other science:</p>

<p><a href="http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/astrology_checklist">In the few cases where astrology has been used to generate testable expectations and the results were examined in a careful study, the evidence did not support the validity of astrological ideas.

    <div class="md"><p>I do have to admit to at least some degree of bias against astrology, due to anecdotal evidence. You see, I&#39;m a fraternal twin. My entire childhood was spent in the presence of someone quite unlike me who was born merely five minutes apart from me. Indeed, our elder brother, born on a month half-way around the calendar, has a personality between that of me and my twin. I&#39;m not terribly interested, however, in debating the validity of astrology.</p>

<p>My main point is that the vast majority of astrologers, if not all, do not approach astrology through the scientific method. As such, it is not a scientific discipline, regardless of the question of validity. It could certainly be made into such a discipline, provided even the most minimal degree of validity. However, it is not at this time.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be more than willing to look at the validity question when astrologers adopt the scientific method and clearly define exactly what can and cannot be predicted by astrology (obviously dynamically varying with further studies). Until then, I&#39;m quite comfortable leaving the validity question open and working from more rigorously tested disciplines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do have a lot of natural earth cycles that influence human activity. The 4 seasons are a great example of this. So many of earth&#39;s earliest religions worshiped animals, the seasons, and solar and lunar movements. </p>

<p>There was a time where a typical year in the life would begin with planting of crops which in this case we&#39;ll start with spring, as it is really the beginning stage in the season cycle for reasons that will be clear at the end of this little parable. And since the sun is the source of all the energy in the solar system it will be the main influencing factor for how the seasons change. Anyways with the sun on the rise after equinox we first begin to see plants grow, the main source of food for wildlife and the beginning of agriculture for people. Beltane was originally a festival celebrating fertility, at the midpoint between spring and summer. As we move into summer the sun has the most strength. Days are hot and the people rest from the hard work they&#39;ve put in growing their food. As we move into fall we see people harvesting their crops. Many feasts are had in the fall, but of course a good amount of food is to be saved for the winter. After the fall equinox and we move into winter, people grow closer as they retreat to their homes for warmth. Those who were unfortunate enough to endure harsh winters often have to hunt as their main source of food in these months. The sun is at its lowest point on the horizon for winter solstice, and many pagan religions recognized this day as the death of the sun god. The sun stays on the same level on the horizon for three days, and rises after. There was a pretty good reason the Catholic Church adapted the Christ story to pagan sun cults, since that was the appeal of the majority of the Roman population. They swapped their gods and goddesses with priests and saints right under their noses. </p>

<p>But those were the simple days of human living. There really isn&#39;t any reason we need to support these inept economic slavery systems. People still have the exact same capability of being self sustaining as they were for thousands of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when people like to discredit astrology as some pseudo-science, I like to refer them to the clock analogy.</p>

<p>&quot;A clock causes time as much as astrology causes events.&quot;</p>

<p>Meaning, that a clock can do nothing more than tell you what time it is, and thus what time it will be. Astrology is the same in that it only tells what is happening and what will happen, but it isn&#39;t the source of the incident. It merely calls it out. </p>

<p>And things can be changed - you can move faster or slower through time, but time is somewhat inevitable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I firmly believe that every single present moment has meaning. If people here have a hard time grasping what it means to be truly present, I would recommend listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4j6cUwCRmI">Alan Watts speak on the subject.</a> It&#39;s much more Eastern philosophy than Western, but I think it&#39;s a crucial aspect of our human existence.</p>

<p>So if every moment has purpose, then even the slowest movements and positioning of planets and stars have to have some kind of purpose, they are moving in time just as much as we are, but with present mindfulness we realize that at any moment, they have a unique signature in time and space.</p>

<p>Just quiet your mind, close your eyes, breath, and sink into your being. Extraneous thoughts will pop up now and again, but let them fade. Do this to feel your connection with the present. It&#39;s best to do it on soft soil, to help ground you to the earth as well. Grounding meaning to get a deeper and more spiritual connection to earth, not like you&#39;re at risk of floating away when you meditate. </p>

<p>Mindfulness and presence can be trained as well, and this can help you move faster and slower through time, as you mentioned. It&#39;s mostly about perception, and meditation practice really does clear one&#39;s perception about the world.</p>

<p>And I have actually read into Mckenna&#39;s Timewave Zero theory. Absolutely fascinating. I would argue that it&#39;s very closely related to Moore&#39;s Law, with our technology exponentially becoming more advanced. We will eventually reach a point where we can cure most diseases and have access to free energy, unless of course we destroy ourselves with our nuclear arms, but I would like to hope we can avoid unnecessary destruction. With that being said, I know violent times lie ahead.</p>

<p>No one said anything about my so called lack of training in basics physics is your problem. Hell, no one even mentioned that I have a lack of training in physics. </p>

<p>Solve for G, as in gravity? Plug in weight, as in mass x force of gravity, and distance. </p>

<p>Anyways, your problem is this....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a watermelon in the room next to you exerts more gravity on you than Jupiter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All i asked was for a source since you made that claim. Why should I have to do the calculations for your claim? I am not talking about sources to astrology or sources that have debunked it. I am simply asking to back up your claim with the science you seem to so clearly understand. So why not help me out with my lack of training in basics physics?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Pluto is no longer considered a planet is a relatively arbitrary designation. It has two of three criteria, and other criteria not considered, like having it&#39;s own moons. Even the current designation is equivalent to &quot;not a true Scot&quot; - it&#39;s a &#39;<em>dwarf planet</em>&#39;, not a <em>real</em> planet. That astrology doesn&#39;t care about the designations of the astronomical Council of Nicea is no argument for or against anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You did make the claim. That you&#39;ve not seen evidence in favor of astrology shouldn&#39;t cause you to determine it&#39;s bullshit. Go and look at it. We take arguments from authority at face value all the time and that&#39;s what this is. Couldn&#39;t possibly be true... I think that &#39;argument&#39; is based on the faith that consciousness is entirely biological in nature. That&#39;s fine, it&#39;s the best we can expect from the regular joe as everything he&#39;s ever been taught implies that is true, but it&#39;s not absolute and it completely ignores testimony that implies it&#39;s not true.</p>

<p>If you really aren&#39;t making the claim that astrology is bullshit, then why say that it is? Someone else can just say it&#39;s not bullshit, and that has the same force as your denial as it stands.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure if you look you can find an explain like I&#39;m 5 for the evidence we have for black holes and the big bang theory. If you look a little harder you might even come to the conclusion that astrology is as bullshit as any other religion.</p>

<p>Is there no evidence or have you just not bothered looking for any?  I&#39;d say there is plenty of (circumstantial) evidence - at least enough to warrant further study/research.

<p>No I&#39;m not, I think religions have been created, corrupted, and perverted by humans in order to increase their control and power.  However, I think there are some core truths that can be gleaned from studying religions and the things on which they&#39;ve been based (astrology being one of the main ones).</p>
