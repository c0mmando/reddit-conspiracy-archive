<p>This line on the Pentagon lawn pictured by Space Imaging Corp. on 9,7,2001 shows the attacker exactly where to hover and fire to eliminate the records of the 2.3 trillion missing dollars at the Pentagon. I found it myself shortly after the attack with a Google Images search.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, never seen that aerial shot of the Pentagon lawn before...</p>

<p>I am still unsure as to whether or not the video of the missile hitting the Pentagon is legit, as people claim it was based off of another video of a helicopter circling the Pentagon (which can be found on Youtube) which was then mirrored to make it seem like the missile was hitting the location that was struck.</p>

<p>If the video IS legit, what do you think fired the missile? And what kind missile was it? Has anyone uncovered any information on that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I&#39;d like to point out that you have not presented any evidence that the auditing activities were being carried out in the area hit by the plane.  Do you have any evidence that they were?</p>

<p>Second, assuming the auditing activities were being done there, how is that consistent with a conspiracy to kill the auditors? The area where the plane hit happened to be the only one of the five sections of the pentagon that had undergone blast-resistance fortifications following a building overhaul plan that had been implemented after the 93 WTC bombing.  Why put the people you want dead in the most secure part of the building? </p>

<p>For more on penren, see <a href="http://www.masonrymagazine.com/8-02/penren.html">http://www.masonrymagazine.com/8-02/penren.html</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.defense.gov/dodcmsshare/briefingslide/204/010915-D-6570C-001.pdf">http://www.defense.gov/dodcmsshare/briefingslide/204/010915-D-6570C-001.pdf</a></p>

<p>Third, even if the auditors were in that part of the building, you have offered no evidence that the auditing process was actually irreversibly impaired by the attack.  Do you have any evidence that unique military financial records--for which there was no other copy--were destroyed in the crash?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I did.  He is putting forth a theory for what he believes was the government&#39;s motive to attack the pentagon.  The problem with that theory, as I pointed out, is that it is several key pieces of evidence away from being anything but baseless conjecture.  He might as well say the government destroyed that part of the building in order to kill off the aliens hidden there.  There is just  as much evidence for that fanciful scenario as the one he is trying to pass off.</p>

<p>And think about.  Why would he government announce the audit if it was so damning that it would necessitate a major attack on itself to cover up?  Why couldn&#39;t the government just manufacture documentation to show that the numbers checked out after all?  If the audit was being conducted in that section of the pentagon (and there is no evidence that it was), why couldn&#39;t the government simply control the process?  After all, there is not a single auditor who has spoken out to say that the attack prevented them from conducting the audit.  Is the government controlling that?  And if the government can control how and when the auditors speak out, then why would it have to destroy documents in the first place?  Not only is there no evidence for his theory, it is logically incoherent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he was pointing out his view that no plane was involved regardless of what was in the damaged section of the building, followed by you chastising him for not proving the contents of the building hit by the plane (which he does not think exists).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. They had black ops with trucks filled with airplane parts, so when the bomb went off, they quickly knocked down light poles, destroyed a firetruck and scattered the front lawn with the parts.</p>

<p>Never mind the photos of charred, dead bodies strapped into airline seats that were found inside the Pentagon. And all the eyewitnesses from the freeway.  All of this was staged. Flight 77 secretly flew off to some remote base and all the passengers were officially &quot;dissappeared.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This message has been edited as noted.</p>

<p>It has been established that the light poles , all but one, could have been down at any time in the preceding hours and no one would have noticed.</p>

<p>It is also established that the FBI was immediately on site to confiscate video from public sources,  as was an official photographer for Sipa Press who took a famous picture as the building was hit from a position that would be a &#39;no mans land&#39; at the expressway border of the pentagon lawn.</p>

<p>This photo was taken before that flames even had time to become flame shaped.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/scXI5v3">http://imgur.com/scXI5v3</a> </p>

<p>Anyone seen malingering there would need to be working for the Pentagon or they would be in a heap of trouble.</p>

<p>That implies that a crew pre placed  and  ready to fake the remaining taxi cab  pole evidence is not at all out of the question. The taxi driver fell apart  and refused to answer when interviewed about  the incident involving himself.</p>

<p>I know of no destroyed fire truck but that would not prove anything up or down.</p>

<p>Interestingly the earlier pictures don&#39;t show any parts scattered on the lawn. The later in the day the pictures were taken the more parts are seen. The early and the later pictures are completely inconsistent.</p>

<p>edit here is the first picture from the event.</p>

<p>Enlarge it, Do you see all of that clean clear lawn?</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/r0Uii">http://imgur.com/r0Uii</a></p>

<p>I believe they simply walked those parts  out of the hole in the building. After all, who would notice? Cleanup, right?</p>

<p>I&#39;d be very interested to see your &#39;charred dead bodies strapped into seats&#39;  as all I&#39;ve ever seen was pictures of several  baffled cadaver dogs with nothing to find.</p>

<p>edit, here are some of mine , let&#39;s see yours.</p>

<p>One direction of the freeway traffic, the one that had a clear view, had been shut down  by the military shortly before the event. </p>

<p>Virtually every witness had a different description of what he saw because as you can see in the .gif  I posted here, they only had a fraction of a second to see it. </p>

<p>As to the passengers, the planners and executioners of this event clearly had to be psychopaths and the disappearance of the passengers will only be explained when they are brought to justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the video you offer in your second link shows the white object striking the pentagon in a different location than where the crash happened in reality.  that&#39;s why someone reversed the video: the non-reversed version you posted below shows the object striking the northern half of the western face of the pentagon, while the real crash occurred on the southern half of the western side of the pentagon.  the reversed version is simply a laughable attempt to cover up that obvious error.</p>

<p>Pause it and look where the impact is.  the object in that video is coming from the northwest and striking the northern half of the west face of the pentagon.  the real attack, however, came in from the southwest and struck the southern half of the west face of the pentagon.  see <a href="http://www.twf.org/News/Y2003/01-PBPR.pdf">page 5 of the performance report</a> to get a perspective and then compare it again to the video.  you&#39;ve been fooled by a fairly obvious hoax video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the pentagon performance report is claiming the wrong side of the building was struck? That&#39;s your position?</p>

<p>And do you think the Washington monument is on the south side of the pentagon? Better check your map again, my friend. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve been duped by a pretty lame hoax video. Look where the Washington monument is in that video, check page 5 of the performance report, and try again.</p>

<p>The full video is corrupted The reason for that is probably that  it  had to jump through hoops to be smuggled out to us but this  is still  what I believe to be absolutely true.</p>

<p>The full video has some  funny pixelation and is reversed   but again it&#39;s far more evidence than can be produced by my potential opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I can tell, this is not true. There were some accountants killed that day, but they worked for the Army Resource Services Washington office. <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/pentagon_9-11.htm">Neither the Office of the Inspector General nor the Defense Finance and Accounting Service was hit on 9/11</a>, and the office of the Department of Defense Comptroller <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=43927">continued to work on the accounting problems.</a></p>

<p>The trillions of dollars were not missing money, but bad accounting practices.</p>

<p>The 2.3 trillion dollar number is from a <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports/fy00/00-179.pdf">audit report (PDF)</a> from the year 2000 (for fiscal year 1999). However, these were not one-time problems, but an ongoing accounting mess.</p>

<p>The $2.3 trillion was mentioned in a <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20010103&amp;amp;slug=pent03">newspaper editorial in January 2001</a>. Then Rumsfeld was asked to look into the accounting problems at his confirmation hearings on January 11, 2001.</p>

<p>Rumsfeld mentioned the accounting problems on September 10 as part of <a href="http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430">a routine speech: &quot;DOD Acquisition and Logistics Excellence Week Kickoff—Bureaucracy to Battlefield&quot;</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not missing money. It&#39;s $2.3 trillion dollars in inadequately-documented accounting transactions. This is all for fiscal year 1999, when the whole defense department budget was only $275 billion. You can&#39;t lose nine times your entire budget. A given expenditure is counted many times, as the transactions are grouped by larger and larger organizational units, for different periods of time (weekly/monthly/quarterly/annually), and for different purposes.</p>

<p>Most ($1.4 trillion) of the accounting entries were created so that the Navy could produce a monthly report before the electronic data from the Marine Corps was ready. The accountants in Cleveland typed in the data from a print-out of a Marine Corps report. A few days later, each month, they deleted that data when the electronic feed of Marine Corps data was ready.</p>

<p>From pages 20-21 (PDF pages 26-27) of the <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports/fy00/00-179.pdf#page=26">OIG report:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The $1,463.2 billion reported as unsupported accounting entries entries for the Navy General Fund are related to the process that the Department of Defense (DoD) used to reflect the Marine Corps budgetary data on montly Department of the Navy (DoN) budgetary reports. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Cleveland Center preparse consolidated department reports for the DoN that include both Navy and Marine Corps data. Marine Corps data is prepared by the DFAS Kansas City Center. At the DFAS Cleveland Center, hard copy Marine Corps Report on Budget Execution (SF 133) data is used to prepare the Navy SF 133. The Marine Corps SF 133 budgetary
data input from the DFAS Kansas City Center is entered via a journal voucher process and then reversed after the SF 133 report preparation.  About three or four days later, the DFAS Kansas City Center provides the DFAS Cleveland Center a detailed electronic budgetary trial balance dataset at the level necessary to produced the Appropriation Status by Fiscal Year Program and Subaccounts (DD Form 1002). Therefore, the data from the SF 133 is replaced  by the detailed data when it becomes available. Since the SF 133 data is replaced, it has no impact on the financial statements. The annual audited financial statements are prepared using the detail-level year-end amounts. Therefore, none of the referenced $1,463.2 billion was used to prepare the Navy&#39;s official financial statements.</p>

<p>This office does not agree that the entries were unsupported. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG), DoD claimed that all of these entries were unsupported because (1) there was not a fully integrated system to enter budgetary trial balance data from the DFAS Kansas City Center to the DFAS Cleveland Center departmental system, and (2) the DFAS Cleveland Center used a pseudo general ledger account in the journal voucher process to establish budgetary accounts based on the SF 133 data. The entries were supported by the hard copy SF 133s provided by the DFAS Kansas City Center. The use of a pseudo general ledger account has no effect on the Marine Corps SF 133 data reflected in the Navy departmental SF 133. This office agrees that the use of the hardcopy SF 133 and the journal voucher process is not the most efficient process to enter Marine Corps data into the Navy SF 133. The DFAS is reviewing the process and plans to have a better procedure in place before the end of FY 2000 for the DFAS Kansas City Center to provide bugetary trial balance data to the DFAS Cleveland Center departmental system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That still leaves $900 billion of bad accounting which <em>could</em> conceal a lot of waste and fraud, but still doesn&#39;t mean that anywhere near that is &quot;missing&quot;.</p>

<p>The Defense Department <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=43927">continued to work to reconcile the numbers</a>, but efforts to create a new, accurate accounting system failed, and had a low priority after the U.S. went to war.</p>

<p>Reuters did a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part3">good series in 2013</a> about how the Defense Department&#39;s accounting is still fucked up.</p>

<p>edit 
Oops it was actually the Secret Service.</p>

<p>&quot;All the evidence that we stored at 7 World Trade, in all our cases, went down with the building,&quot; according to US Secret Service Special Agent David Curran -- the number three guy in that office. &quot;We lost our network, we lost all our computers, we lost all the equipment that we use as Secret Service Agents. Everything from machine guns to our shotguns to our electronic equipment that we use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A lot of cases had to be closed as a result of losing that building.&quot; – David Curran.</p>
