    <div class="md"><p>He specifically targetted Jews and Roma and gays and journalists and communists and unionists and anyone else who didn&#39;t fit into his national paradigm.</p>

<p>There are many factors that made Jews easy targets.</p>

<p>The vatican had long blamed Jews for Jesus&#39; death, and much of thr German populous were Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>In earlier times, Jews were disallowed from owning land, coupled with being tradionally insular, meant you would have heavily Jewish areas where gentiles would rarely go, and Jews would rarely leave, which made some people highly suspicious.</p>

<p>Because the church banned Usury amongst Christians, one of the only way to get loans was through non-Christians (Jews), which made some Jews very wealthy (not all bankers were rothschildesque megabankers, back then it was common to have mom n pop banks) even though this disolved much of the economic stagnancy at the time, many saw it as Jews becoming rich off of the hard work of Gentiles.</p>

<p>Because biblical studies have been one of the most important elements of Judaism, there was a time when literacy rates amongst Jews dwarfed literacy rates of Gentiles. When books and reading started playing a much larger roll in society, this became a huge advantage to the literate Jews who were often hired as courtisans, accountants, philosophers, etc. Suddenly Jews were often found in Royal courts (especially in the ultra-progressive German states) which many saw as infiltration.</p>

<p>Those points and more lead to ingrained Judenhass (trans: Jew-hate) which the Nazi party exploited when needing to unify the newly founded (&amp;lt;100 years) German state into a warmachine.</p>

<p>There are other factors, and i may not have gotten my facts 100% straight, but to my understanding these were some of the underlying reasons for the Nazi party targetting the Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews were accused of making Germany lose WWI. This was referred to as &quot;Dolchstoss&quot; or &quot;The Stab in  the Back.&quot; It was a delusion. Germany was defeated. But it was popularized by German officers. Generals in WWI Germany were rock stars. Kind of like Roman generals. They were highly autonomous. They were surrounded by yes-men. They did not want to take the blame for defeat. So, blame the Jews, as many have done before them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats partly not correct! The &quot;dolchstoss&quot; is, from the propaganda of the nazis, the opposition of the communist and socialists partys. Because they were agianst the war, right wing partys said: because they didnt helped in the war, they are against us. Jews werent accused for the lost of WWI, actually, a few hundred thousands of jews fought for germany in the WWI!</p>

<p>&quot;Nazi remarks and documents on the Holocaust are riddled with circumlocutions and euphemisms making it difficult to decipher precisely what is meant. Breitman adduces Rosenberg&#39;s &#39;biological elimination&#39; comment as evidence that the basic decisions were taken earlier. But a key find among the Himmler papers indicates to Gerlach that Hitler and Himmler conclusively decided in December 1941 to pursue the Holocaust. A note handwritten by Himmler dated December 18 and referring to a meeting just held with Hitler says: &#39;Jewish question - exterminate as partisans.&#39; Those few words could change the expert view on the Holocaust.&quot;
Oh, it&#39;s not as if Himmler&#39;s appointment diary clearly states after a meeting with Hitler on the Final Solution that they were to be &quot;exterminated&quot;. Oh wait, that&#39;s exactly what it does say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of my family is German Jewish, my Aunties mother was wealthy and from Berlin, and when Herr Hitler told Jews to GTFO, she flew first class to New York. My own grandmother was also from Berlin, and was taken to England on the Kindertransport when she was 12, she was once went to buy bread with a wheelbarrow full of cash, and was robbed for the wheelbarrow as the cash was worthless while the wheelbarrow was at least useful.</p>

<p>My grandfather&#39;s father was a high ranking German cavalry officer in WWI, and was spared by the SS, although he refused to fight and was deported to Palestine, they refused to let his catholic wife go with him.</p>

<p>To say that Jews were a certain way is facetious, as not all of them had enough wheelbarrows to afforsld bread, but i am certain the ones that did would have seemed to have flaunted it. Was your family also from Berlin or Munchen (financial capitols of Germany)?</p>

<p>With the occult side, Himmler (who was far more into it than Hitler from my knowledge) was a member of the Thule society, who are the norse offshoot of the Typhon worship who&#39;s symbol is the black sun, Jews come from a solar cult, so there xould be a connection there. Although the lightning bolt design of the SS insignia is a kabbalistic symbol. The problem with <em>occult knowledge</em> is that as suggested, it is hidden, and a lot of <em>researchers</em> like to fill in the blanks, and there is a tendency to circlejerk in that community, so A cites B who cites C who sites A, and all of them site D, but he made it up 100 years ago, and theres no way to prove/disprove that.</p>

<p>Jews being victimised throughout history is a little tricky. Much of it happened because their place of origin is in what is currently Israel, which happens to be the land connection between Europe, Africa, and Asia. This means that any empire taking over the world generally went through that region, most of those empires found it best to destroy the local populace (although some didn&#39;t) many empires didn&#39;t last long, and so the Jews mainly stuck around there being &#39;victimised&#39; for centuries.</p>

<p>When the Jews revolted against the Romans in 74AD, they got smashed, and the Romans had enough of them. Many were exiled, many were taken as slaves, few remained in the area, and fewer still were taken as guests or payed workers. This began the diaspora. The jews settled fairly comfortably with their arab neighbours for quite some time and had thriving communities in iraq, iran, afghan, india, etc. But had more troublea during the caliphate when not-islam equaled not-good. The western exiled jews went to tunisia, libya, algieria, and formed a large communities in morocco and turkey, and spain. Every once in a while Islam would become more fundamental and kill the non-believers.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t only Islam, some of the crusades targetted jews for allying with the muslims, sometimes christians just hated on jews for killing jesus (i never understood this one),  meanwhile back east, jewish communities had popped up in the &#39;stans and steppes, and a large community formed in northern mongolia/southern russia, and in russia spread about around russia. Like every generation of new immigrants, there was some hate and vitriol from the local populace, but these jews were much poorer than the local populace and had no restrictions in employment, and so could be found workong fields and factories for and along side ethnic russians. Anti-semitism was still pretty rampant in russia, and after a few lost wars and some bad times all round russians had less to share with their new immagrants, and along with many others, jews were slaughtered. The oppressed rose up against the oppressors and bolshevik russia was born. And, well, your guys were the next...</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:1</strong> Not all jews wore fur coats/could afford to eat, but the ones that did were extremely noticable.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:2</strong> Being a small group of insular immigrants won&#39;t make you popular, rinse and repeat over 3 thousand years with a hundred different groups in a hundred different countries, and you&#39;re gonna have a bad time.</p>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> It&#39;s important to note that in the AD, it was no longer a small singular group, but many many small groups spanning the world. If you took all the &#39;white&#39; groups (picts, celts, thracians, britons, gaelics, visigoths, austragoths, minoans, cretians,  vandals,  etc) you may conclude that &#39;white&#39; groups have been &#39;victimised&#39; throughout history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps it has to do with the very foundation of Judaism being the belief that their tight-knit (inbred) group of ethnic purity is better than everyone else and chosen by god. This notion is engrained into the hearts and minds of Jews across the globe and has been for thousands of years. This belief is what is used to justify lots of bad things. This type of thinking also led the nazis to genocide, as the two both cant be the chosen ones on this planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is factually wrong and has nothing to do with Jewish beliefs. In Judaism, being the chosen ones means &#39;chosen to carry god&#39;s burden&#39;, and means that Jews have to follow the word of god strictly so he doesn&#39;t FUBAR this world. It means that if a non-jew follows 7 of the 10 commandments (don&#39;t kill, steal, rape, etc) they are welcomed to heaven, whereas Jews have to do all 10, one of which involves a much larger and much more annoying set of rules, and if they don&#39;t follow them to the letter, they get to sit around watching all the non-jews hanging out in heaven with god eating bacon.</p>

<p>You know nothing of Jewish lore, and you&#39;d be best educate yourself on it before commenting on it, or risk appearing foolish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anti-semitism has always been a part of the greater European experience. Most of the time the Jewish presence has been tolerated but events could cause it to break through on occasion.</p>

<p>WW1 was a war of attrition where the Germans had won the war by 1916. A consortium of Jewish bankers approached the US to get involved and so prolong the war for the benefit of the bankers. Hitler was only one among many who pointed out that the German state was sabotaged from within. Hitler gets the blame or the rising anti-semitism only becaue he emerged as the spokeman for the Nazi movement. </p>

<p>Jews were easy propaganda targets. Once the propaganda gained momentum it became self-propelled. We have to keep in mind that several &quot;solutions&quot; were attempted to get the Jews to move out peacefully prior to the war. Once war broke out there was still a sizable Jewish population that had to be housed and fed. Both of those responsibilities were beyond the means of a German state that was involved in a war that refused to end as early as predicted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the Biggest reasons is because Zionist German Jews traded victory in WWI for the Palestinian state and created modern Israel. The Zionists promised England victory by bringing in the American forces by using the banking system. </p>

<p>Losing WWI which the Germans did NOT start caused a HUGE economic devastation, which led the the emergence of Ultra-nationalist leaders such as Hitler, who used the betrayel of the German Jews as a basis for a nationalist hate of the Jewish people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could have to do with the fact that they declared war on Germany in 1933.  Of course you will never hear about that anywhere but conspiracy circles and white pride camps.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure if any type of peoples declared war on America before WW3 started that we would put those people in FEMA camps, but the Nazis are painted as the devils of the world for doing what any strategically intelligent nation would do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending everything they did, and I do not support their political ideology at all, but I do think the history books and discussion on the topic have been molded in such a way as to make the Germans look far worse than they were.  You can pretty plainly see it once you grow up and are no longer indoctrinated with with the fabrications they teach people in school in this country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There doesnt need to be fabrications its all here to see. Germans are anally thorough, everything was documented by their own hands. You want to dismiss generations of historical science on that matter by thousands of people as a fabrication?</p>

<p>&quot;Nazi remarks and documents on the Holocaust are riddled with circumlocutions and euphemisms making it difficult to decipher precisely what is meant. Breitman adduces Rosenberg&#39;s &#39;biological elimination&#39; comment as evidence that the basic decisions were taken earlier. But a key find among the Himmler papers indicates to Gerlach that Hitler and Himmler conclusively decided in December 1941 to pursue the Holocaust. A note handwritten by Himmler dated December 18 and referring to a meeting just held with Hitler says: &#39;Jewish question - exterminate as partisans.&#39; Those few words could change the expert view on the Holocaust.&quot;
Oh, it&#39;s not as if Himmler&#39;s appointment diary clearly states after a meeting with Hitler on the Final Solution that they were to be &quot;exterminated&quot;. Oh wait, that&#39;s exactly what it does say.</p>
