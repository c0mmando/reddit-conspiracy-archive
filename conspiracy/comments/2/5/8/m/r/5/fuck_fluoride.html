    <div class="md"><p>Your body doesn&#39;t need fluoride for any messenger chemicals or any tissues whatsoever.  People will point out that chlorine is a poison and compare it to fluoride.  Guess what, your body does use chlorine.  It&#39;s in your stomach acid and it&#39;s in the salt your body uses.  The thing about fluoride that makes it so bad is that it accumulates in your tissues and bones and alters functions.  If you get too much in your bones it causes dental and skeletal fluorosis.  It deforms teeth and bones and weakens them at higher exposures.  Just type those two terms into google images and you&#39;ll see the typical effects of high fluoride exposure.  Most of the time when we see such negative effects from substances that our bodies don&#39;t use whatsoever, we declare them poisons.  </p>

<p>When it comes to fluoride we instead declare it the only medicine worthy of administration through the municipal water supply, which causes uncontrollable doses for those who drink the water and consume the food products grown and made from that water.  It sure was convenient for the phosphate industry and other industries to declare their toxic, corrosive waste product a medicine that can be put into the public water supply.  We don&#39;t just dump it directly into the water bodies, that might be bad for the wildlife.  It&#39;s added at the water treatment plant at 1 part per million.  There are reports of cheap fluoride from china containing residues of other substances that clog up the machines that administer it.  This is not pure medical grade stuff, but often is waste from industry.  Some of these toxic waste soups also contain heavy metals, other elements that harm us which our bodies don&#39;t use whatsoever.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to know more about the behavioral effects of the stuff myself.  I&#39;ve seen a good documentary where they visit Chinese villages with natural fluoride in their water that greatly exceeds the 1 ppm we put into ours.  They had a community with 4 ppm and another with 9 ppm.  The elementary kids at the schools they visited showed heavy dental fluorosis and there were cases of crippling skeletal fluorosis in those communities.  The way the kids behaved compared to other kids in the documentary from communities with lower ppm of fluoride was shocking to me.  They didn&#39;t rhetorically elaborate in the documentary about the behavioral effects.  I looked at their eyes and their attentions.  The kids from the 9ppm community looked <em>very</em> disconnected from the environment around them.  They didn&#39;t look like stimulated youth looking around for novelty as much as idle, vacant minds.  We need more studies on the effects of fluoride on the brain.  We&#39;re not being told the truth about this substance.  It could be more than just a convenient way to dispose of toxic waste, but to kill two birds with one stone, a way to make the population disconnected from the reality around them, more docile and accepting of authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fluoride makes children retarded, often reducing childrens IQ&#39;s by more then ten points. Harvard study is the one I think you&#39;re referring to with regards to China, as well the Medical Journal the Lancet has classified Fluoride as a neural toxin. So definitely something you do not want to have in your body, as well its something you should as the women in Houston Texas did, try to get your city council to stop city fluoridation, but probably under a cost effect analysis, a lot of people aren&#39;t aware of this basic information and would likely defensively stone wall otherwise, unless of course they&#39;re privy to its effects.</p>

<p>Also we have to thank the corrupt U.S. government for water fluoridation, as they manufactured all this fluoride bull crap to stop lawsuits against the military industrial complex who were at the time manufacturing atomic bombs(fluoride is a key element in atomic bomb development).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really care where it comes from, it&#39;s still fluoride. Are you shocked that it is naturally occurring in water and that fluoridation can actually mean reducing the amount of fluoride in the water to bring it to the regulated levels for public consumption?

    <div class="md"><p>Now I never suggested that anyone was intentionally poisoning anyone. That&#39;s a straw man argument and not at all related to my statement. Naturally occurring fluoride salts are present in some water supplies, but that isn&#39;t the issue either. The fluoride salts that we use (it isn&#39;t really fluoride anymore in most municipalities, it&#39;s hexafluorosilic acid or similar compounds) are NOT naturally occurring at all. They are in fact byproducts of phosphate mining and tin manufacture that would in any other context be considered toxic waste that would require expensive and difficult procedures to dispose of it properly. Disposing of fluoride any other way could be considered an act of terrorism due to its high toxicity. Do some reading on industrial fluoride pollution and just how harmful it was to plant and animal life near to phosphate mines. Now they use wet scrubbers to collect the fluoride salts from the phosphate gas and repackage it as industrial fluoride to be added to municipal water supplies. You become their toxic waste dump. As far as this being done intentionally to keep people stupid and docile, that is outside of the scope of my points, although I do concede that some powerful people may know and would like it to stay this way.

<p>You said there isn&#39;t any evidence to suggest that fluoride is harmful at the levels we consume it. Thing is, there absolutely is, and the number of doctors/Phds that are talking about this issue is actually growing, not fringe or discredited whatsoever.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I only used that quote because the doctor had 34 years at the national cancer institute. Someone that works for so long with that kind of experience isn&#39;t something to scoff at. And like I said, the doctors that share his view have been increasing over the course of time.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s such a long dead issue, how come there are referendums every year with states and communities stopping fluoridation across the country? Why are more doctors concerned about this more than ever?</p>

<p>I have read it myself, many times. The consensus of those trying to refute the study is basically that they used higher levels of fluoride than those found in U.S. water supplies. Which is not only NOT completely true, but is mostly irrelevant to the point. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ilikemyteeth.org/fluoridation/dangers-of-fluoride/fluoride-iqs/">http://www.ilikemyteeth.org/fluoridation/dangers-of-fluoride/fluoride-iqs/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The studies concluded that even levels of calcium fluoride slightly higher than the levels we use in the U.S. water supply are more likely than not damaging to IQ. What makes this worse is that although we do not use such high levels, we use MUCH more toxic fluoride, silicate fluorides and sodium fluorides. That link you gave happens to leave out the fact that we use fluorides that are MUCH more toxic than those that the study was done on. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a neurotoxin that slowly causes organ damage amongst other things over a  long period of time. FDA levels used in US water supplies are just low enough to not cause serious immediate damages but are still enough to cause long term harm because of the nature of the types of fluoride they are using. </p>

<p>If the harvard study is such faulty science (ironic considering it&#39;s harvard, but perhaps it&#39;s true) then why is it THE most prestigious neuroscience medical journal on the planet used it&#39;s study to release an in depth report on fluoride?</p>

<p>If it&#39;s so irrelevant and there isn&#39;t enough evidence on the topic to be worthwhile, how come the Lancet is so concerned about the topic?</p>

<p>EDIT: My reply to your edit reply</p>

<p>Clearly they will distance themselves from foregone conclusions as any smart scientist will, that doesn&#39;t mean the research doesn&#39;t support such things though. In addition, you still have no reply for why the lancet would use this study considering it being THE most respected neuroscience journal in the world? Also...no response on the fact the study was done on the natural version of fluoride and still found it to be at least mildly harmful yet we put HIGHLY toxic silicate and sodium fluorides in our water supply? No thoughts on that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sodium Fluoride is used in most toothpastes, mouthwashes, dental varnish, dental preparations and nutritional supplements. This same form of fluoride is used as an insecticide and pesticide, as a preservative in glues, as a growth inhibitor for bacteria, fungi and mold. Sodium fluoride is also used in making steel and aluminum products. Added to molten metal, sodium fluoride creates a more uniform metal. Other industrial uses for sodium fluoride include glass frosting and wood preservatives. Sodium Fluoride is also used in the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons. Although this form of fluoride can be used for water fluoridation, the next two forms listed are almost always used due to cost.
Calcium Fluoride (CaF2) is compound of calcium and fluorine which occurs naturally as the mineral fluorite – also called fluorspar. Most of the world’s fluorine comes from calcium fluoride. Fluorides in general are toxic to humans, however CaF2 is considered the least toxic, and even relatively harmless due to its extreme insolubility. Moreover, calcium is a well-known antidote for fluoride poisoning. When an antidote exists in combination with a poison, it makes the poison far less toxic to the body. Calcium fluoride is the form of fluoride commonly found in natural, untreated waters.
Cryolite or Sodium Aluminum Fluoride is commonly used for aluminum smelting, though is also a pesticide often applied directly to field crops, resulting in permitted fluoride residues in and on fresh fruits and vegetables. For more information on cryolite.  (For more information on cryolite.)
Fluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) is commonly used for water fluoridation.  This form of fluoride is a toxic liquid by-product, acquired by scrubbing the chimney stacks of phosphate fertilizer manufacture. Other names for it are hexafluorosilicic, hexafluosilicic, hydrofluosilicic, and silicofluoric acid.  The CDC approximates that 95% of our water is fluoridated with fluorosilicic acid. (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/fact_sheets/engineering/wfadditives.htm#1">http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/fact_sheets/engineering/wfadditives.htm#1</a>)
Sodium Fluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) is primarily added to public drinking water as a fluoridation agent. This same compound is also used as an insecticide and a wood preservative.  It is a classified hazardous waste by-product of phosphate fertilizer manufacture which, if not put into our drinking water, must be disposed of at hazardous waste facilities.  Other names for it are Sodium Fluosilicate and Sodium Silica Fluoride.
Stannous Fluoride  is the popular name given to Tin (II) fluoride. Stannous fluoride is an additive to many toothpastes because it does not become biologically inactive in the presence of calcium, as sodium fluoride does.  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin%28II%29_fluoride">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin%28II%29_fluoride</a>)
Sulfuryl Fluoride is applied as a gas fumigant to kill insects and rodents. Using sulfuryl fluoride around food products was not allowed due to its toxicity. In 2004 the EPA reversed this policy (following long lobbying efforts by the manufacturer) and allowed its use on food.  This opened the doors for food processing companies nationwide to fumigate their facilities with sulfuryl fluoride, leaving high levels of fluoride in and on foods and even food packaging.  It has become acceptable for sulfuryl fluoride fumigations to produce fluoride residues of 70 ppm “in or on” processed foods and 130 ppm “in or on” wheat. There have been no labeling requirements for foods treated with sulfuryl fluoride, meaning that consumers have had no way of knowing which foods are treated.  (For more information on sulfuryl fluoride.)
In January 2011 this decision was reversed and in about 3 years this fumigation of food reportedly will stop.  (Order to cease sulfuryl fluoride fumigation of food products.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can further elaborate if you would like. Note in particular that calcium fluoride (the natural version) is not what is used nearly 100% of the time when we are talking about water fluoridation and dental fluoridation or most other types. So for people saying that &quot;its natural we evolved with it&quot;, that applies to calcium fluoride which is hardly toxic. However we are fluoridating water supplies and other things with highly toxic silicate fluorides and sodium fluorides. </p>

<p>So no...fluoride isn&#39;t the same molecule wherever it comes from. Not even close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, only 40% of the country uses the highly toxic silicate fluorides. The other 60% that&#39;s fluoridated (most likely) uses the sightly less toxic sodium fluoride, a byproduct of aluminum manufacturing and primary ingredient in rat poisoning.</p>

<p>Amount of country that uses natural calcium fluoride for water supply fluoridation? Probably less than 3%. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sir addressed almost none of what I have said. What about hexafluorosilic acid? What are it&#39;s long term health benefits or risks? How much water should a small child drink to get optimum fluoride? Adults? How can you even justify mass medicating a population with any drug? How do you control the dose? You cannot. If they really wanted to help our health by mass medicating the populace there are actual beneficial minerals and vitamins that would be much better and safer. But you know, those aren&#39;t toxic byproducts that need to be disposed of at a tidy profit. You know the difference between intelligence and education? Education requires hard work, and diligence and the ability to recognize that you don&#39;t know everything and still have more to learn. Sounds to me like education is a bit too hard, so instead you adopt the hive mind mind opinion like a good little worker drone.

<p>Actually it&#39;s not. Depending on how it was formed, different types of the same base chemical can react very differently in the body. Natural fluoride is not nearly as harmful as the stuff created in the byproduct of aluminum manufacturing, and even that stuff isn&#39;t as bad as the most common fluorides made today...silica fluorides.</p>

The fools that cheer their own demise.  Those who know are still exposed to a poison that makes them docile and dumb.</p>

<p>Anyone else find it interesting that as fluoride exposure increases, there is a direct decrease in the number of people who stand up and protest the unjust treatment?  But it&#39;s for the kids!  Think of their cavities!  The side effects are worth the minimal decrease of cavities.  As this poison kills them, it also kills some of the bacteria.  Coincidentally fluoride is actively used as a industrial poison.  To kill pests.  But he&#39;ll, let&#39;s put it in our water supply.</p>

<p>In Europe, where certain locations have banned the fluoridation of water, they then force fluoride out in their milk supply.  </p>

<p>Until the people wake up and demand water without poison added, this poisoning will continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The harvard study, a meta-analysis in fact, compares water within the <em>recommended</em> level of fluoride, i.e. the same as fluoridated water or less, to that with excessive, very high amounts of fluoride. It is based mostly on chinese studies where large amounts of fluoride are sometimes naturally present in the water table and have been thought to cause problems. Again, this could be solved by fluoridation because the amount of fluoride would be reduced to safe levels. The harvard study does not even necessarily imply that water fluoridation is dangerous, and certainly draws no strong conclusions about anything.</p>

<p>The study said that more studies are needed at lower levels in the U.S. to adequately determine fluoridation safety, but that&#39;s for the suckers who want to wait for the corrupt government to give them the ok to believe an obvious truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This just shows you are not interested in the scientific approach. Contrary to what the study said, the study you brought up as evidence, you have now decided it&#39;s an obvious truth. Even those who carried out the study have distanced themselves from the conclusions that you are trying to draw from it, and have cast doubts on the quality of the studies on which this meta-study is based. What&#39;s more, according to them, the difference in IQ points falls within a reasonable margin of error for IQ testing. IQ tests, like meta-studies, are things that need to be understood in context and not always something you can draw direct conclusions from.</p>

<p>At least you are getting the fact that the study related to very high levels of fluoride naturally occurring in water, not the much lower amounts introduced to your water, and not the cheap chemical byproduct you are so scared of. And if you did have those super-high levels in your water, your supplier would be obliged to filter it out until it was safe. Hooray for fluoridation. Now where&#39;s that cheque...</p>

<p>You also seem to concede that the study does not in fact suggest fluoridation of water is harmful, so respect for that, we got there in the end even if I was banned in the process. Enjoy your circle jerks everybody. He said bitterly :)</p>

This opened the doors for food processing companies nationwide to fumigate their facilities with sulfuryl fluoride, leaving high levels of fluoride in and on foods and even food packaging. It has become acceptable for sulfuryl fluoride fumigations to produce fluoride residues of 70 ppm “in or on” processed foods and 130 ppm “in or on” wheat. There have been no labeling requirements for foods treated with sulfuryl fluoride, meaning that consumers have had no way of knowing which foods are treated. (For more information on sulfuryl fluoride.) In January 2011 this decision was reversed and in about 3 years this fumigation of food reportedly will stop. (Order to cease sulfuryl fluoride fumigation of food products.)</p>

<p>I can further elaborate if you would like. Note in particular that calcium fluoride (the natural version) is not what is used nearly 100% of the time when we are talking about water fluoridation and dental fluoridation or most other types. </p>

<p>So for people saying that &quot;its natural we evolved with it&quot;, that applies to calcium fluoride which is hardly toxic. However we are fluoridating water supplies and other things with highly toxic silicate fluorides and sodium fluorides.</p>

<p>So no...fluoride isn&#39;t the same molecule wherever it comes from. Not even close.</p>

<p>Welcome to reality, Medical journal the Lancet has already classified fluoride as a neuro toxin as well Harvard study also came to the same conclusion. Basic jist of it, the U.S. government created bull crap studies to prevent litigation from farmers during a Manhattan project where there was a spill of fluoride, which killed cattle, trees and damaged the psychical health of local farmers in the area, who all settled out of court. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A neurotoxin that doesn&#39;t kill anyone? How bizarre! I&#39;m not familiar with the Lancet one you&#39;re talking about, but I suspect that site is twisting their words as usual. And the <strong>much-quoted</strong> here Harvard study doesn&#39;t back you up anyway, because anyone whose actually read any of it can see that they&#39;re talking about much higher levels than are used in domestic water supplies, and it&#39;s based on information from China, who aren&#39;t exactly the writers of the most robust studies on a good day.</p>

<p>Also, you may have forgotten that this isn&#39;t Planet USA. It might surprise you to learn that other governments don&#39;t really give a shit if some farmers in the US were accidentally poisoned, so some small local issue you guys had would have no effect on the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Ah, I&#39;ve just taken a look at the Lancet study - another one based in China. Actually... no. <strong>It&#39;s the same studies!</strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the only reference to it, by the way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A meta-analysis of 27 cross-sectional studies of children exposed to fluoride in drinking water, mainly from China, suggests an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children exposed to raised fluoride concentrations.44 Confounding from other substances seemed unlikely in most of these studies. Further characterisation of the dose–response association would be desirable.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their <strong>sole reference</strong> – 44:</p>

<pre><code>Choi, AL; Sun, G; Zhang, Y; Grandjean, P. Developmental fluoride neurotoxicity: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Environ Health Perspect 2012; 120: 1362–68.
</code></pre>

<p>19 of those 26 reports are less than three pages long. Now I&#39;m all for being concise, but if you&#39;ve read many scientific papers they tend to be a bit longer than someone&#39;s curriculum vitae.</p>

<p>Also, 8 of the Chinese papers were translated into English by Paul Connett’s &quot;Fluoride Alert&quot; (FAN) activist group. Oh dear! No bias there, I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>Glossing over history isn&#39;t a benefit to anyone, especially if we&#39;re doomed to repeat the same stupidity all over again. The litigations are significant because it shows us the base research conducted by the government was done fraudulently and that the safety of fluoridation is founded on fictitious &quot;science&quot; to shield then A-Bomb development and the military industrial complex and the government. If you bothered to read the entire Harvard study out you&#39;d know there&#39;s no recent information with regards to testing of fluoridation to see if it is truly harmful.

    <div class="md"><p>Just from a quick glance at the Harvard data, it should be noted that in all but one (I think, definitely most) of the studies in the meta analysis were comparing levels of fluoride exposure between a high and a control, where the control was usually within the range we currently set in the US, and the high group was an order of magnitude higher, from natural fluoride sources.</p>

<p>They specifically say that this analysis cannot establish a dosage, and didn&#39;t attempt to specify anything about a particular dose, just a comparison.</p>

<p>One interesting thing I saw in the report --</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Still, each of the articles reviewed had deficiencies, in some cases rather serious ones, that limit the conclusions that can be drawn.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes into some details, but I&#39;m not sure how significant they were, considering this paper was published anyway.</p>

<p>And they explain that most of the studies were almost never cited or even available to the US because of 1980&#39;s China&#39;s policies on scientific papers being allowed out of the country.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It should really be noted, that in many cases, the government&#39;s fluoride program&#39;s purpose was to reduce the naturally occurring amounts of fluoride down to safe levels.</p></li>
<li><p>It should also be noted that fluoride was definitely identified as a neurotoxin a long time ago, but this review is specifically about risks from amounts lower than those that ARE SAFE for adults. So if you are an adult, fluoride (EDIT: at the levels established as safe, obvs) is GRAS. This review doesn&#39;t call those studies into review.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT: Just want to be clear, the two bullet points are for emphasis, they aren&#39;t quotes from the article/study.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of your analysis, with exception to fluoride being safe in lower levels to adults, the Harvard study said there was no concurrent data to analyze in the U.S., as such it called for studies on low amount of fluoride exposure in humans in the U.S. It should be noted that we do not always have low levels of water fluoridation here, depending on a number of factors from water treatment, where fluoridation levels can be higher then, I think its 1mg/L? Then there are also sources of exposure such as from foods sprayed with pesticides, beverages, processed foods, and almost everything we buy now comes form a country with no comparable health or safety standards to that of North America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you for letting me know about these issues. I got most of my stats straight from manufacturers product claims and other articles but you are right, there is a lot of conflicting information on the issue of removing fluoride, mainly there are people that claim the water needs to be de-ionized before it goes thru a reverse osmosis system in order to successfully remove flourides . more info here(<a href="http://orbisvitae.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;amp;Number=62526">http://orbisvitae.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;amp;Number=62526</a>). It all depends of what the manufacturer of the system claims. <a href="http://wellness.com.au/reverse_osmosis">this company</a> claims their new water filtration system removes about 99% of fluoride, again thats their claim. In my opinion if you are buying a RO system make sure you can return it if it does not remove the amount of fluoride they claim as well as to test the water before and after the filter you bought. Also note RO system get rid of minerals in the water(unless system has mineral filter to add minerals back) as well as distillers and if you are drinking only this type of water and your diet is poor in vegetables your body will start to suffer from lack of minerals. Also note RO system generally come with a water tank to store water in advance. I personally dont trust what these tanks are made of and can add other chemicals after you filter the water. If you are going for the RO system, i would research more about said tank or just skip the tank and filter straight to a different container.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion. I would go for a distiller, yes it takes time to filter and uses electricity but distillers, as best as i know, are the best water purification processes that get rid of the most contaminants including fluoride. If you are going with this, I would also add to your diet minerals in the form of a pill or add a daily 8oz of the so called &quot;green juice&quot; from the &quot;gerson therapy&quot; to help your body get the minerals you removed.the green juice will replenish your body with lots of minerals and vitamins as well as other beneficial elements and will clean and keep your body healthy. well just eating healthy and exercising will keep you healthy. Anyway hope this helps, if you dig up anything else let me know too, i like staying up to date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grazie mille - if i get this stuff tested, will let you know what I find. I was able to get a distiller that goes so far as to have a glass spigot, from China no less. Still don&#39;t really know how much better it is, but our tap water smells like a barnyard, even through a fridge filter, so I figure any bit of offset I can do is better than not doing anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cool. also forgot to mention, distillers turn water acidic, so make sure you level that ph too. lime or lemon juice in the water will turn alkaline once you drink it. you can also add a bit of watermellon and make watermellon flavored water. you can also add a touch of bakin soda but try going natural. hope the distiller works great for ya.  also would it be 2 much to ask for a link to said distiller? having a glass spigot sure sounds good.</p>

For $20/month or less, you too can have distilled water delievered to your house weekly.  In large 5 gallon jugs.  They gave me an office type water dispenser for free for signing a cancellable at any time water delivery contract.  Worth every single penny to me.  And yes, I be noticed massive benefits after getting off fluoride.  Seen first at the 2 month mark, and growing from there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry i though it would turn into anther bash me for drinking clean water kind of thing.</p>

<p>the idea is that there are inorganic and organic minerals. inorganics minerals are rocks, things that are not alive. organic minerals are found in fruits, they are alive. your body has no use for inorganic minerals (rocks) but can only process organic minerals (doesnt matter if the fruit itself is organic or conventional, its the minerals im talking about). also drinking minerals even organic isnt the save all drink. its better to eat clean and drink pure (distilled) water. </p>

<p>hope it clears some thoughts up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But but but...</p>

<p>Some of the inorganic &quot;rocks&quot; in your dirty water are things like Calcium (apparently not one of these organic minerals), I don&#39;t know about YOUR body, but mine uses Calcium for some pretty important things (Like Locomotion, chief amongst those).</p>

<p>Are you saying that eating minerals in a solid form is ok, but drinking them in a solution is detrimental? </p>

<p>I only ask because that&#39;s insane.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure your body has all kinds of uses for the other dissolved stuff in water...</p>

<p>Also, if the water you are drinking is TOO pure it will <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1750612/dangerously-clean-water-used-make-your-iphone">kill you</a>.  </p>

<p>Not that many people would drink that water... but if mineral-depleted water can leech the vital minerals from your body, I would imagine that water that is merely mineral-low would also do some of it&#39;s own leeching.</p>

<p>In short: Hard water is shitty to bathe in, but is best to drink.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well being that I work for &quot;the water company&quot; I can honestly say that minerals in your water come from both the environment of the source water as well as the treatment process within the plant. </p>

<p>The calcium ion one would get in solid food is the exact same ion you woukd get out of tap water, and both are processed in your stomach, and from there the calcium goes into the bloodstream and then to the bones and other various necessary parts... the vector the calcium uses is essentially irrelevant.</p>

<p>Water is a solvent, and it really really wants to have stuff dissolved into it, really pure water has nothing dissolved into it, and so will strip your body of vital nutrients because it really wants to have stuff dissolved into it. Without said nutrients you will not survive</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If water is going to strip minerals out of you it will not discriminate between one type or another. </p>

<p>Washing with purer water is probably a good idea as it will more easily take up impurities on your skin, making for a better clean.

<p>water that is distilled holds a different charge then regular water. i believe its negatively charged which means when it passed through you body it collect all the positive charged stuff which is like bacteria and living things in you. the other reason why they gave the scientest gave it the unappleaing name &quot;distilled&quot; as a pose to what it is &quot;pure&quot; is because in a water its all charged the same(negative) so its always repelling itself, so it is never still. there is also less drag in distilled water(its all trying to be apart from it self anyways), it boils quicker(because you have no minerals to heat up in the process), and feels smoother to drink(because of the repelling nature). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in Water Treatment, and the Municipality I work in is not the one I live in.  My own Municipality does not Fluoridate its water, but the one I work in does.  I bring about 2 litres of my own water every day, and if I run out I fill up my bottles from points in the treatment plants prior to the addition of the Fluoride. </p>

<p>There is no reason for Fluoride to enter the bloodstream, I know there are concerns of neurotoxicity and other forms of brain damage, but there is a lot of mud in the water about that topic right now.  I am against Fluoride because of what it does to our bones.</p>

<p>The Fluoride ion will displace the Calcium ions in your skeleton, this will change your bones from structures with a strength akin to concrete, into something that more resembles glass.  Both are hard, but one is brittle and will break very easily.  </p>

<p>It is good when it hits our teeth, the Fluoride bonds with our tooth enamel and forms a hardened barrier around our teeth. Teeth don&#39;t (normally) sustain forceful impacts so the brittleness is not a factor, bones on the other hand, undergo a lot more strain, stress and impact, and thus having them reinforced with Fluoride becomes a risk.</p>

<p>OP I commend you for attempting to remove Fluoride from your life, but it DOES have its use, maybe grab some Fluoridated toothpaste and mouthwash and remember to spit and rinse each time.  </p>

<p>It really is beneficial for your teeth, just don&#39;t let it into your bloodstream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really care where it comes from, it&#39;s still fluoride. Are you shocked that it is naturally occurring in water and that fluoridation can actually mean reducing the amount of fluoride in the water to bring it to the regulated levels for public consumption? Seems a strange thing to do if the aim is to poison everybody. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shills are not interested in such inconvenient facts.  They kill any and all arguments they have for the forced application to all citizens, regardless of informed consent.  The fools that cheer their own demise.  Those who know are still exposed to a poison that makes them docile and dumb.</p>

<p>Anyone else find it interesting that as fluoride exposure increases, there is a direct decrease in the number of people who stand up and protest the unjust treatment?  But it&#39;s for the kids!  Think of their cavities!  The side effects are worth the minimal decrease of cavities.  As this poison kills them, it also kills some of the bacteria.  Coincidentally fluoride is actively used as a industrial poison.  To kill pests.  But he&#39;ll, let&#39;s put it in our water supply.</p>

<p>In Europe, where certain locations have banned the fluoridation of water, they then force fluoride out in their milk supply.  </p>

<p>Until the people wake up and demand water without poison added, this poisoning will continue.</p>
