       George HW Bush was most certainly involved in the JFK murder.  The facts are all out in the open, but ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bush family are the biggest criminals the country has ever seen. You can see mounting evidence of them being puppetmasters for the past 50 years.

       This was a letter written by Lee Harvey Oswald's "friend". Amazingly this same man, George de Mohrenschildt, was a long time family friend of the Bushes.

        Maybe you will be able to bring a solution into the hopeless situation I find myself in. My wife and I find ourselves surrounded by some vigilantes; our phone bugged; and we are being followed everywhere. Either FBI is involved in this or they do not want to accept my complaints. We are driven to insanity by this situation . . . tried to write, stupidly and unsuccessfully, about Lee H. Oswald and must have angered a lot of people . . . Could you do something to remove this net around us? This will be my last request for help and I will not annoy you anymore.

       Not only that, but we have the sitting president, Lyndon B. Johnson, talking on tape about how he blackmailed Earl Warren to head the Warren Commission and whitewash the investigation.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       This is an explanation of what you will find on the archive.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        LBJ also blackmailed Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, to head the Warren Commission. Warren had years before committed some sexual sin on a trip to Mexico; J. Edgar Hoover, an LBJ ally, had tape recordings of this sexual encounter that, obviously, if released would shred Warren's lofty reputation and end his professional and social life. LBJ twice asked Warren to head the commission and Warren twice refused. Concerning the third such "offer", LBJ can be heard on tape describing the incident to his mentor, career guardian and close friend, Richard Russell of Georgia. Russell routinely taped all his phone conversations for official records and memoirs (and probably for his own protection). LBJ explained to Russell that when Warren again refused to head the investigative commission, LBJ pointed out that he had tapes of Warren's departure from his marriage, in lurid detail, which he'd release to the press of Warren didn't cooperate. Warren can be heard crying, and exclaiming "Please Please don't. I'll do whatever you want. Whatever you want." LBJ was laughing about this in his phone conversation with Russell of Georgia--publically esteemed Grand Old Man and Dean of the U.S. Senate. Presumeably, this was not the first such revelation of LBJ to his mentor, Russell, whose "public reputation" was one of moral uprightness and integrity
       </p>

      <p>
       We have a sitting president on tape blackmailing a supreme court justice and nobody talks about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazingly, John Hinckley (the guy who tried to assassinate Reagan) was a close friend of the Bush family too. I'm sure that it's just a coincidence even though the odds must be astronomical.

       says that "Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency" was briefed (the day after the assassination) by W. T. Forsyth of the FBI, but it doesn't say anything about him being in Dallas. It also says that someone from the Defense Intelligence Agency was present, so the briefing was most likely in the Washington, DC area.

       Yeah I've read the official story.  Theres more too it than that, so on keep reading.  Regardless of JFK, based off all the documented info on Bush and his connections,  if you really thing he wasn't in the CIA before being named DNI, you have some studying to do.

       The thing is... you hear the story of JFK Jr's crash on tv and think "terrible accident" but later watch a doc on the subject that claims there were some important, relevant facts omitted from the original story... facts that if true, make you think "shit, they killed him"

       I doubt that was the reason. I think they just killed him so he couldn't run for the senate and then the presidency. But I recently watched a documentary (on Netflix) about his death and when they got finished I was convinced it was an assassination.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First, the radar data describing the path of Kennedy's plane showed that just as Kennedy was making his final approach to the Martha's Vineyard Airport, his plane, in the absence of any explosion or engine malfunction, suddenly plunged headfirst into the ocean, falling 2500 feet in 45 seconds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, the fuel selector valve on Kennedy's plane was found to have been turned to the off position.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bizarreness of Kennedy's sudden dive into the ocean is obvious, but the equally bizarre fact that the fuel selector valve had been turned off requires an explanation that the official NTSB report did not provide.
       </p>
       <p>
        This scenario may seem fantastic until we realize that only about 100 days later and only about 50 miles away from the site of Kennedy's crash, this is precisely what happened aboard Egypt Air Flight 990.

        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So even if the copilot got control of the plane he probably wouldn't know the fuel selector was off and wouldn't be able to get it back on during a dive. And that dive had to be deliberate. Even if the engine had cut off it would have glided some distance. This was straight down.

       The search delay for such a public figure cannot be explained away with any more conviction than that secret service man being told to back away from the father's limo.

       Yeah. And the family knew he was missing and had been trying to get a search started, something that should have been automatic. If I remember rightly even teddy was ignored for hours.

       I think this is the most likely explanation. He would have been a front runner against GWB, and would have likely won by a sizable margin. He was loved by the entire country, whereas GW was just a coked up alcoholic spoiled brat with a fake Texan accent.

       I'm amazed so few people talk about the spectacular hit on JFK's elder brother, Joe Kennedy Jr. He was talked into piloting a flying bomb/drone, radio controlled by a separate plane which just happened to be carrying FDR's son, Elliot. Kennedy was told that although the separate plane was capable of precisely guiding the drone into a target, it somehow needed a pilot for takeoff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say, the bomb was activated prematurely, blowing Kennedy to smithereens with 20,000 lbs of high explosive. FDR's son, Eliot Roosevelt admitted he was on board the accompanying aircraft, but didn't say if he set off the bomb. They even got the whole thing on film. Quite the ritual blood sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is denied -

       Do you have any evidence of this?

       There were known (to the company) issues with his aircraft and many, many lawsuits over it.  Quite scandalous actually, much like the repeated crashes due to defective Firestone tires around that time.  I know people who crashed the exact same plane model and settled with the company under gag order.

       idk if it was because he found evidence on sr., but Jr. definatley died under b.s. circumstances.

      <p>
       He was a rigoroulsly trained pilot, and also the next big thing in the democratic party once he reached age.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think "they" were so scared he would be as big a problem as his father in having his own free will, and knowing his name alone would get him the highest office in the land.

      <p>
       They couldn't kill two presidents with the same last name back to back, it would look to fishy, so they took him out before he had a chance to run.

       Most conspiracies are born from situations that do not have enough evidence. Also, not everyone can immediately be born with all the evidence and information. Somewhere down the line, each person has to find their own evidence to form the best opinion they can. This frequently means stopping to ask at some point in time, especially of people how may have already done a bit of research on a topic. This also means bouncing ideas off of people some times. I don't see
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as an end point publication of peer reviewed information and ideas, but a place of collaboration where people can present questions, evidence, and ideas, then collaborate with others to collectively gauge the reliability, credibility, feasibility, and relevance of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our outside critics seem to like to push the logical fallacy that our intermediate steps of collaboration are proof that the end result will be flawed.
