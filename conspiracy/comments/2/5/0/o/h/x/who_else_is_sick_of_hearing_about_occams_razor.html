       The same goes for any of the many "logical fallacies" that a lot of ignorant people like to bring up as a way to discredit anyone who posts revealing information. Where i can see Occam's Razor being a useful principle in some ways, it just seems like an easy copout for someone trying to cover things up. Why the fuck do things have to be "simple" for anyone to believe it?

       I'm sick of hearing it from people who have done no research, and know zero about history.  Those that use this term just think that what the mainstream media tells them is the simplest (which it usually is), and then use occams razor to sound smarter about having these parroted beliefs, while if they truly understood this world and the history of the last 4 or 5 decades they would see that occam's razor applied to something like 9/11 is meaningless at best. The same people who say "They couldnt have done 9/11 because someone would have talked"  It's opinion.  rhetoric.  enough people are that fucked in the head that 9/11 did happen, and sometimes the simplest explanation is that people with money and power conspire together to get more money and power.  That simple

       This. I don't understand why the concept of powerful, greedy people wanting to gain more power is such a difficult concept to believe. People can believe that the "terrorists" are evil and out to hurt them, but not the people who actually have money and influence to make things like 9/11 happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people would take a look at history, its not hard to see shining examples powerful men committing heinous acts. Hell, it's not hard to see the capacity for evil in the average joe.

       I will admit it was a pretty convincing lie at first.  Then again, I was in fifth grade when 9/11 happened.  It took me until 2009, but once I grew up and learned history it was just so obvious.

       You can't use past conspiracy events to claim that every future event is a conspiracy. You need to make a case for each one. It doesn't have to be a fully verified and documented theory, but it does have to have elements that cause people to become skeptical about the official story.

       That's people using occam's razor badly, and not occam's razor being a bad form of investigating for truth. Occam's razor requires that our explanation include all "pieces of the puzzle", and so leaving out things that don't make sense for the sake of simplicity, is not occam's razor. That's ignorance.

       Agreed. Although Occam's Razor is a valid and helpful principle, it would be idiotic for everybody, all the time, to apply it everything. For any issue, it is always healthy to have a subset of people investigated a wide range of possibilities. Sometimes they will be right.

       There is nothing wrong with Occam's Razor. It still requires that the preferred simplest theory explain all of the observed phenomena.

       Occams Razor is not about being "simple". But about having to make the fewest assumptions. This heuristic should always be valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have to accept a lot of unproven stuff for a proposed theory to make any sense. It often is wiser to not accept that theory.

      <p>
       That people maybe are using it wrong could of course be annoying.

       It should NOT always be valid. It's not a law of nature, it's just an argument in favour of reductionism. It really has no actual bearing on real life, nature, science or anything. It's literally just one guy saying "I think simpler things are more true." Nothing more than that.

       There is no issue with Occam's razor or with using logical fallacies to refute an argument. The important thing to address is whether or not the accusation have validity. We shouldn't be arguing about those not being proper forms of argument, because they in fact are.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't have to be simple, but there needs to be valid reason for speculation and the arguments have to be logical. Otherwise, we are just writing fiction here.

       It's a common mistake to think that Occam's Razor means, "The simplest explanation is likely the right one"
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, it's more about the amount of new assumptions that have to be made to accept one hypothesis over another competing one.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's defined as "among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove correct, but—in the absence of certainty—the fewer assumptions that are made, the better."
      </p>
      <p>
       And, "In the scientific method, Occam's Razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible and more complex alternatives, because one can always burden failing explanations with ad hoc hypothesis to prevent them from being falsified; therefore, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are better testable and falsifiable."

       I see Occam's razor referenced constantly, SO much so that I have come to strongly suspect that many people do not understand what it is and when to apply it. Occam's razor is not equivalent to the idea that "perfection is simplicity". In the scientific method, Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic, and certainly not a scientific result, nor is it a method by which we derive scientific facts themselves. Occam's Razor is not intended to be a definitive proof or methodology. Rather, all it says is that there is a tendency where often, the less complicated explanations are generally the right ones. It is not a substitute for research, nor is it a reliable way to make decisions, in and of itself.

       I'm confused, are you in support of my post or against it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd agree 100%, most people who use it as if it's an actual point of evidence in itself are completely misusing the term or don't understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really best used against a conspiracy theory in cases like the 9/11 inside-job conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that, given the assumptions we would have to make to assume that   the events happened as we are popularly told are far fewer than the assumptions we would have to make to accept the inside-job hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in even more specificity, a common issue with the "official story" is that there was no plane debris outside of the pentagon. Yet the simplest image search on google shows dozens of pictures of plan debris. The conspiracy response is that all those pictures were either faked, from another plane crash, the parts were quickly shipped in to stage the pictures, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes far, far more assumptions to believe that the pictures taken are somehow not genuine then it does to assume they are just normal pictures of the debris from a plan impact.

       Well duh, but it's pointless to say this. "If" I were wrong, I'd of course like to know the truth, but that's true for any topic or idea that I currently think is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will likely believe in anything that has testable, falsifiable, logical, and repeatable evidence to back it up. Until the 9/11 'truth' has sufficient evidence of this kind, any rational being must conclude that there is not yet a compelling reason to assume the popular understanding of the events of that day are unable to explain the phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because, if you want to prove that it was an inside job, you first have to prove that evidence we do have is not consistent with it NOT being an inside job. It's as much proving that is was X as it is proving that it isn't Y.

       If you wanted to talk about 911, I'd be a good person. I was there among the other New Yorkers that day. My office was a studio on the 12th floor of a small building directly up the street from the WTC.

       I'm not a Truther in the sense that I believe in bullshit. What's BS is the official story. If you wanted to investigate for yourself, I'd be more than willing to help you, but mostly, I don't bother. If you have your mind made up this far, with all the evidence available to you, it's likely not worth trying.

       Honestly, I don't value your opinion more than anyone else there that day, unless you are an expert in building failure analysis. You could've been on one of the planes and somehow survived, for all it matters. No offense. Proximity to the events does not by necessity grant improved knowledge of the events.

       This one is interesting, I'd never even heard about it before. It appears to have been almost entirely generated from one woman claiming "they were like happy, you know … They didn't look shocked to me. I thought it was very strange," she said. That's it, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one story has been exaggerated to the point where they were chanting and high-fiving, laughing and taking selfies, etc. I can completely understand how this story could get out of hand, but the FBI cleared them of any 9/11 related charges or involvement or foreknowledge. But of course, if the story is that the FBI would lie about things like this, then it gets added to the pile of position evidence ("Of course they denied it! That's how they keep us in the dark!" type 'evidence').
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a valid argument, it's an ad-hoc hypothesis. The FBI found that none were involved, so now the choice is to either accept that conclusion or argue that they were lying. If you want to assume they are lying, then you must provide evidence that they were wrong.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Passenger cell phone calls??
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Well, apparently most of the well known calls (esp. on flight 93) were made on airphones, which isn't suspicious or strange at all. But I'm sure you know this. You mean the actual cellular telephone calls that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       This idea that phone calls from 30,000' are "impossible" is wrong. I will definitely agree that it was impressively lucky how many calls went through. But one thing we cannot know is how many other calls failed to go through. If we knew that 27 attempts were made, and the few that made it were the only ones, would it seem so special?
       <a href="http://connectedplanetonline.com/wireless/ar/wireless_final_contact/">
        No one is saying that calls from a plane are reliable or will last a long time, but all the cell phone calls were less than 60 seconds
       </a>
       , which is about what you could expect if you were flying near so many cell tower sites, like on approach to New York, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will definitely grant that this is super unlikely, and amazing that so many calls went through at all. But it only seems suspicious in the context that there is a conspiracy. Taken on it's own, it's a remarkable instance of fortune. There is no need for a conspiracy to make the claim, "A lot of people got lucky with phone calls that day."
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible to make calls from a plane? Yes. Is it likely the calls will last and have acceptable quality? Not really. Is the complete fabrication of the calls required to explain the event as described? Absolutely not. It is not evidence of anything on its own except that phone calls DO work at altitude.

       <li>
        WTC Building 7
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There are a lot of claims about this one. Typically it's either that it didn't have substantial damage ahead of time, that it recently got insurance, and that it was ordered to be "pulled". Let's go one at a time.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Damage.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/wtc7_smoke_4.html">
        Smoke was billowing out of the building in
        <em>
         considerable
        </em>
        volume.
       </a>
       There really isn't any reason to assume the damage internally was not extensive leading up to the collapse of the building.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Anti-terror insurance right before the attack.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Absolutely true. If you allow "right before" to extend to 1993 and earlier. We know they had "terror insurance" at least since the bombing at the WTC in 1993, because that action
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/09/11/wtc-attack-to-cost-insurers-billions/">
        cost insurers $500+ million dollars
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Most insurance companies do not even have a special recognition for claims based on terrorist action anyway, as it's not considered to be an act of war (which is not covered, generally). Terrorism coverage is the norm, not the exception.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        "Pulling"
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is a great example of grasping at straws on the part of the 'theorists'. Put simply, in the phrase, "We decided to pull
       <strong>
        it
       </strong>
       " the "it" doesn't refer to the building, it refers to the contingent of firefighters in the building trying to put out the fires.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the phrase was "We decided to pull
       <strong>
        them
       </strong>
       " instead, would this even be part of the evidence? "Pulling" isn't even accepted lingo for building destruction by explosive anyway. It's always used literally, in reference to pulling a building so that it falls in a particular direction or even literally pulling the building down via cables.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why would this be admitted on national television if it's part of a grand conspiracy?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I know you didn't explicitly say any of these things, like, at all. But these are what I hear most often. Thanks for the offer, but I don't rely on one guy's testimony for anything, so nothing personal. I trust what the majority of expertise in the subject matter says.

         On Flight 11: The only calls made were airfone calls from the two flight attendants. There were four other instances of the airfones being turned on, but no calls were made. It's unknown who was operating the phone(s).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         On Flight 77: There is no evidence that any calls made on this flight were made with cell phones according to the 9/11 report documents.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         On Flight 175: There is an airfone call that is often claimed to be either a cell phone call (false) or faked specifically because the line was reported as closed ~4 seconds after impact. This margin of error, especially considering the circumstances, is not unexpected, nor is it somehow proof that the call must have been fake.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That's the best I could find without wanting to read thousands of pages of analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what a plate-spinner is, but I guess I am one? Any research put together by anyone motivated to hunt for anomalies, or to use "consistent with" in place of "evidence of" is of little interest to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official reports gathered from experts and expert analysis all point to the official story as the likely explanation for the events of 9/11. This only seems questionable if you already have the mindset to accept the idea that the government would stage attacks and cover it up. If you do not already have a predisposition towards that mindset, then the fact that an exhaustive report didn't turn over anything extraordinary is not unexpected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason that "official reports" are not seen as valid evidence is that the claims being made must by their nature assume that all official reports are to be taken as untrustworthy or false automatically.

       Iaasc Newton's theory states that each particle of matter attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       However the orbit of the planet Mercury illustrates flaws in Newton's theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Einstein's theory states that gravity is not a force at all, but rather a distortion or curve of space-time and that a falling object is moving in a straight line, against a curved space time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more recent theories that refute Einstein's theory - but that gets into quantum mechanics.

       Occam's Razor is often used by skeptics in a wrong way:
       <br/>
       From wikipedia:
       <br/>
       The razor states that one should proceed to simpler theories until simplicity can be traded for greater explanatory power...
      </p>
      <p>
       Simplicity:
       <br/>
       Many conspiracies are actually very simple theories, they usually state the SIMPLE FACT that many people are corrupt and are misusing their powers. And that politicians or institutes are no different.
       <br/>
       The discussion is not if it is true, but how much is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then explanatory power..
       <br/>
       When looking at certain physical observed phenomena, some theories are clearly explaining that what is observed. And they have great explanatory power. These theories are often ignored in the media official media. In that case, the simple fact that the official media is often mis-informed about the situation, is clearly explaining the mismatch between the theory based on the observations and the official explanation based on the politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       When does Occam's razor not work:
       <br/>
       When something unknown is involved. We can have simple theories, or complicated theories, but all of that does not matter. We simply can not theorize something that is unknown.
       <br/>
       And that is where most "skeptics" fail. But somehow "skeptics" nowadays act as if everything is already known. And that nothing is really a secret. And from that belief all other conclusions are made.
       <br/>
       This is exactly the opposite of the original Greek skepticism: It stated that nothing was known and only observations were to be trusted.

       its really a dance between complexity and simplicity that most researchers cannot properly manage. On one side, truth needs little explanation and lies need thousands of justifications. Complexity can be used to obscure truth. On the other side, things ARE much more complex than people can even possibly imagine, e.g. when it comes to UCC Law and legal process (just an example). Its not the technique that is problematic, the application is the real problem. People are no longer familiar with the Liberal Arts, the way how to properly think for themselves, if you wish. I have come to find that BOTH is true: the world is much more complex, than presented in media. But if you zoom out, things actually become very simple. The great law of double truth is something that very few indeed can grasp.

       It's the "schadenfreude" of 2014. Clever the first time someone used it in an article, fine the next few times, but eventually so totally overused and trite, journalists so pleased with themselves for working it into an article, that you can't help but gag when you hit it. My favorite, though, was that year in the 90s when "ubiquitous" became truly ubiquitous...

       I love Occam's Razor, but I enjoy it from a Computer Science perspective.  To make something complex, to complect it, is to weave multiple pieces of information together:

       Well duh, but it's pointless to say this. "If" I were wrong, I'd of course like to know the truth, but that's true for any topic or idea that I currently think is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will likely believe in anything that has testable, falsifiable, logical, and repeatable evidence to back it up. Until the 9/11 'truth' has sufficient evidence of this kind, any rational being must conclude that there is not yet a compelling reason to assume the popular understanding of the events of that day are unable to explain the phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because, if you want to prove that it was an inside job, you first have to prove that evidence we do have is not consistent with it NOT being an inside job. It's as much proving that is was X as it is proving that it isn't Y.
