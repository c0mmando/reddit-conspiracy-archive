<p><strong>The Solution Idea</strong></p>

<p>The idea came to me from reading something from <a href="http://thoreau.eserver.org/wendy.html">Henry Thoreau&#39;s &#39;Civil Disobedience&#39;</a></p>

<p>Henry Thoreau subscribed to the philosophy of transcendentalism. It emphasizes idealism rather than materialism; that is, it views the world as an expression of spirit and every individual as an expression of a common humanity. To be human is to be born with moral imperatives that are not learned from experience but which are discovered through introspection. Therefore, everyone must be free to act according to his conscience in order to find the truth buried within. </p>

<p>Thoreau specifically addresses fellow abolitionists who called for the immediate cessation of slavery. Instead of petitioning the government to dissolve the Union with slaveholders, Thoreau believed those reformers should dissolve “the union between themselves and the State – and refuse to pay their quota into its treasury.” <strong>Petitions only strengthened the authority of the government by recognizing its authority and honoring the will of the majority. “[Any] man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already,” he observes.
The reformers who petition government for permission “love better to talk” about justice than to act on it. Thus, Thoreau concludes, “Reform keeps many scores of newspapers in its service, but not one man.” To men who prefer a safe strategy, voting becomes a substitute for action and politics becomes a sort of game, like checkers or backgammon, only with a slight moral tinge.
To Thoreau, anyone willing to leave moral decisions to the will of the majority is not really concerned that right should prevail. When resisting the poll tax, he did not consult the majority; he acted. If he had allowed the majority to decide whether or not he should pay, by his own standards he would have shown no regard for what is right.</strong> </p>

<p>I think he is on the right track with this. We need a commonwealth of people who value right action through their own introspection over what the majority thinks is right action based on the will of the majority since the majority can be controlled by people skilled in controlling crowds. 
But before we can do that, we have to help people understand why majority rule is corrupted.</p>

<p>Now, what if we were able to show how much of a mockery the election system really is by creating our own 2016 presidential election that happens on the web. A website could be designed for anyone that though they would be a good president of the united states and submit their own campaign dossier, outlining whats wrong with the country and what they would do to improve the lives of the people.  Now, I don&#39;t actually think the idea of of having a president and voting on one for a corporation is a good idea since we have learned that the United States is a corporation and the president acts as some kind of ruler of this corporation and we are all subjects to this rule from whoever has the most power in government. I think it would be much better with a federal government that is in the hands of the people with elected leaders of small groups of commonwealth states making decisions on a local level with many leaders. Its my belief that small distributed groups of people can help our society prosper over any top down governing body simply because its closer directly to individuals.</p>

<p>When I use the word commonwealth I&#39;m referring to the 15th century definition &quot;Members working together for a political community founded for the common good&quot;  before it was co-oped in the 17th century to mean &quot;a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or democratic state.&quot; I don&#39;t believe that any society built around a ruling class can work for the common good as rulers tend to do whats mostly in their own interests.</p>

<p>But, we can use the flawed system to draw attention away from the real elections by getting people involved in actually making them feel like they are participating in something that they can contribute to. Where in the real election choice is limited to binary decisions which just makes people feel like they don&#39;t have choice. If people suddenly stopped paying attention to the real elections and instead started focusing on fake elections where they felt like it was more directed toward what the people want, it might start sparking dialog about the nature of our current social/political system and convince people to start looking for other solutions. </p>

<p>We need to give people a vision of what things could be like instead of telling them what wrong the current system. That&#39;s one thing I learned from Eddie Bernays success in convincing the population of this country to follow a capitalistic direction instead of a democratic one. If you want to learn more about that I suggest you watch the documentary <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/countering-behavior-control/century-self">&quot;The Century of the Self&quot;</a>. Its a really good eye opener on how this country developed into desire based economy by manufactured consent.</p>

<p>I feel like this is something we can do to act in a positive way instead of talking about how messed up things are all the time. Why not redirect our efforts from complaining to trying new ideas that unite people in a common cause. To change our political system to be one that is more participatory and less reactionary to our environment. We spend way to much time reacting to things that happen in the world and not enough time creating things that bring the change we want to see in the world.</p>

<p>So moving forward I intend to create a site that does just this, but I am going to need help.</p>

<p>The first thing that needs to happen is to get a group of trusted people to vett others that want to participate this by their Reddit history. All we are looking for is people who have shown an interest in having an open mind and want to do something to better humanity by demonstrating the following behaviors:  </p>

<ul>
<li>People who have posts on Reddit that bring awareness and empowerment.<br/></li>
<li>People that have comments that attempt to inform instead of derail.<br/></li>
<li>People that have accounts that are older than 3 months from the date of this post and have a post/comment history described above.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone has a better way to vet trustworthy people please post.
I was thinking we could run this like a full political <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee">committee</a>. We could call it, The Committee for Political Change. Or something any ideas would be welcome and we would need a full staff of volunteers to make it happen.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about me you can visit my website portal at <a href="http://trinsic.paridiom.net">http://trinsic.paridiom.net</a>. I develop websites in my spare time and fix computers full time. But I want to spend more time working with people that want to make this world a better place. :)</p>

<p>Really the idea of an internet-driven democracy is not new at all, it has been one of the main points of the Pirate Parties across Europe for quite some time, generally named &quot;direct democracy&quot; or &quot;liquid democracy&quot;. I think it&#39;s the way of the future, the question is how long until that future comes to be.</p>

<p>Yeah, for stopping voter fraud. </p>

<p>In the US, we have a federal government fighting against having to show an ID to vote. They will do everything in their power to make voting as fraudulent as possible. When the government is fighting hard against giving out free picture IDs to make sure there is no fraud, you can be sure that there is.</p>

<p>Another major but often overlooked reason that there is no mechanism for verifying how a particular person voted after the fact is to prevent people from selling their votes or powerful entities from coercion (e.g. a spouse or employer demanding proof a person voted in a particular way).  If there is no possible way to prove how you voted, neither of these is possible.</p>

<p>Wat? Proof of stake just allows for a miner oligopoly, so instead of an insanely powerful computer being required to attack the blockchain, you just need a few corrupt holders.</p>

<p>Second, a 51% attack doesn&#39;t hurt vote integrity. You can&#39;t reverse votes with a 51% attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only issue there is they could give more private keys to others.</p>

<p>The best way of handling it would be to release a list of everyone on the voting register, listed by name and DoB as well as a hash of their voting address (something intensive). Everyone knows how many votes there should be, and it would become known if there were more votes than people.</p>

<p>The only issue, is if they add fake people to the list. Not sure how you&#39;d get around that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might be confused but are you saying that it&#39;s not a good idea for the votes to be public. </p>

<p>The system I&#39;m envisioning, this might not be what op meant, would be one where every voter has a cryptographic signature and could use that to cast a vote.  Post it to the &quot;blockchain&quot;.  I know this isn&#39;t exactly how bitcoin works, but I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t be possible.  I know there are people who don&#39;t have internet access, this is another problem that needs addressing.  Assuming the voting system could be developed and implemented, there would be no need for representatives, every voter has a vote.  This would cut down on corruption.  True democracy.  But it&#39;s probably not the best system for a country the size of the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reposting my idea for an an opt-in, scalable form of representative democracy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A piece of legislation gathers signatures to come to a referendum.</p>

<p>You can choose to vote directly on the legislation, not vote at all, or you can &quot;give&quot; your vote to a trusted third party. This third party can be a friend of yours, a family member, or a politician, or a celebrity, a philosopher, a historian, a scientist. That third party then has the option to use the vote, opt out, or transfer it to another person who they trust.</p>

<p>So you have 5 friends and 4 of them don&#39;t really care about politics, so the 5th can be given their votes, now she has 5 votes. She can use them directly or transfer them to someone else.</p>

<p>To prevent fraud anyone casting more than, say, two hundred votes would have to make their voting record public.</p>

<p>Edit: to expand, this would be a nuanced system ideally accessible from people&#39;s mobile devices. Referendi would be tagged based on the issue, environmental, foreign affairs, economic, whatever. You could divide your representatives so I have Dan Carlin casting my foreign policy votes, and Kucinich on domestic policy maybe.</p>

<p>An important element of this system is that you cannot refuse the responsibility of having a vote transferred to you, you can choose not to vote, but you can&#39;t turn down the responsibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had a few debates on this concept already. I think the optimal answer is that you are just given your transaction ID when you vote, and you can verify it on site, but there is no binding link back to an individual person having a unique identifier. Instead, you have a database of voters, personal passwords, and a database of votes - you get checked off in the former when you vote, using some personal secret you need to keep track of.</p>

<p>You do, however, kind of have to maintain on-site voting to prevent physical extortion of votes from people remotely. I still don&#39;t have an answer to keep people from being compelled through force to vote a certain way if you enable remote voting, and you can&#39;t rescind votes in this model because there is no association between who voted and who they voted for (on purpose, because this prevents physical extortion of votes on site).</p>

<p>To remain anonymous you can employ dark wallet functionality so you can see your own vote and everyone can see all votes (but not who voted or they can see who voted but not which way) only of you have the private key can you get this. </p>

<p>As it stands, the vast majority of eligible voters would completely ignore this opportunity.

<p>The only way to make change is to get everyone to play along, and the only way to get everyone to play along is to create the atmosphere that a conservative candidate has just as much of a chance as a liberal candidate (or else the predominantly older, male, less-technologically-adept Republican ~half of the nation will just brush this movement off as &quot;unsubstantial and unimportant&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cryptovoting is definitely possible, and easier when you simply create a new &quot;coin&quot; that say limits itself to 1 whole unit/address generated. The problem arises, as you suggested, when you have to account for a trustworthy registration process to ensure no one receives more than 1 address. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You only need to tokenize a user and have the back end handle satoshi transfer. So user A logs in after being vetted:</p>

<p>Transfer one satoshi to a new address for user A, or directly to user A if they provide an address themselves.</p>

<p>User A picks a candidate and their address (generated by system or their own address) sends one satoshi to predetermined address [of candidates].</p>

<p>Since all addresses are accounted for and relatively anonymous, this would prevent fraud so long as your tokenizer were secure for the login pair assigned to each &quot;vetted voter&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love the idea and the work you put into this post. I think our country could do a lot to fix the system beyond voting for a president. We SHOULD have more local leaders and delegates from each district to Congress. Basically the same sort of representative democracy we have, except without the 435 member cap that was instituted in the early 1900&#39;s. The majority of our world&#39;s population growth occurred after that law was passed, so most people&#39;s voices are drowned out in favor of the 0.00045%. When I have time this summer, I&#39;m going to write a thoughtful essay on the subject. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think a straight election would work since you are still just voting for a person.  It is too much like the current system to vote for a temporary king.  That person will still relate to people at the top, CEOs, more than the average citizen.</p>

<p>What I would love to see is a voting system that replaces the act of the president signing something into law.  Instead an expanding group of citizens does a straight up or down vote on everything that ends up on the president&#39;s desk.  A majority either signs or vetoes the bills from Congress.  As that group expanded into the millions their votes would get news coverage and highlight when the president voted in a way opposite from this independent coalition of citizens.  Eventually it would be obvious that the powers that be repeatedly go against the will of the people and the people will get fed up with the &quot;Daddy knows best&quot; corruption we currently live under.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you would vote with bitcoin, but the underlying technology of bitcoin is perfect because every voter would store a copy of every other voters vote, ensuring voting could not be rigged.</p>

<p>You could require a registration by credit card. The vast majority of people who have multiple cards have them assigned to the same address, so a second registration with a matching name and address could be blocked.</p>

<p>If the credit card companies won&#39;t allow you to have a merchant account without sufficient transaction activity, you could &quot;charge&quot; people $1 to register and refund it when they vote.</p>

<p>We should <em>absolutely</em> do something about it.  The very thing we <em>can</em> do about it that will most definitely work, however (i.e. putting all our petty, societally-indoctrinated racial, class, monetary, etc differences aside and coming together as the one people and one human race that we most definitely are), involves activity and a mindset that is all but entirely indoctrinated out of us from birth.  As a result, we tarry about our entire lives lost in a sea of confusion for the most part, and nothing gets done or fixed on this planet.</p>

It relates somewhat to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/250ydc/someone_remind_me_why_the_masses_put_up_with_this/chcl69e">response B here</a> where I said, &quot;it&#39;s hard to protest en mass when we&#39;re generally living in first world luxury from all the richest we keep stealing off everyone else.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you&#39;d have much less difficulty actually getting participation with something digital in this day and age, and while I long for a good old fashioned protest, I think some action is better than none.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well-said, but at the same time, too many of us think that doing something in cyberspace, or putting in some meaningless vote in some ballot box is enough, and that alone constitutes having participated and &quot;fighting the system!&quot;  Too many people go &quot;Yeah!  I did my part!  I voted!&quot; or &quot;I did my part!  I put up a youtube video!&quot; and think that this suffices.</p>

<p>Contributing in cyberspace is indeed better than nothing, but too often things don&#39;t tend to go much further than that - and more than that would certainly need to get done if the citizenry have any hope of combating the draconian environment that is closing in upon us.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very concerned that people are looking at how fucked up everything is and they blame capitalism, which would be incorrect, as we do not live in a capitalistic society. We live under, what Chris Hedges describes as, a &quot;soft fascism&quot; and others say is actually fascism or corporatism, as &quot;too big too fail&quot; and corporate protections are fictions of the state.</p>

<p>That said, I believe this sort of effort and others like it are exactly what we need to be focusing on if we want to affect real change. Bravo on the great write-up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love this idea and I&#39;ve been thinking about it for some time.  I starting off a few years ago on this idea thinking that it would be great it there was a global mock election using youtube videos for people to run election campaigns, but now bitcoin/blockchain technology has given the idea legs. It seems like some form of blockchain voting would be the most secure.  The difficult part is making sure each person only gets 1 vote.  </p>

<p>Perhaps it could be done using some sort of public national database  like national insurance numbers or something.  Not everywhere has a suitable database, not everywhere even has the Internet, so maybe this experiment is best done region by region?  Or should we be looking as global as possible straight away?  There&#39;s little reason this new direct democracy should have anything to do with the the current and rather quaint &#39;national boundaries&#39;, other than for organising the voting system.</p>

<p>Another way to do it, or perhaps this could be part of it, would be to release an altcoin where there is a &#39;tax&#39; on each transaction, say 10% flat rate on every transaction.  Those coins could automatically go to an address controlled by the &#39;government&#39;, which now consists of <em>all</em> the people.  People then vote on how that money is spent.  No more beauocratic taxation system, no more tax evasion, no more &#39;disappearances&#39; of public funds, no more unwanted wars, no more bailouts.  But that&#39;s thinking a bit further a head.  I&#39;m all in for this mock election idea for now, but I hope it wont be limited to the USA as I don&#39;t live there!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you got me thinking globally now. I think maybe it should start on a region to region basis first. We could create a system like this for each region one at a time for those who want it. It could be linked together after people realize that human rights and freedom is a global need and everyone benefits when the world works together on the big picture. Certain decisions should be made at the local level and certain decision need to be made at a global level depending on the situation.</p>

<p>I have no idea yet how we would do voting as I feel like all online transactions can be subverted. 
What we can do is instead is to list the right actions of every candidate that has been put up for nomination as a way to elect these people. Have some kind of point system for ever right action and impact that right action had,  along with their campaign ideas and there practicality. Then those with the most points would be the winner.
Then we wouldn&#39;t need to be worried about the popular vote from being corrupted. Besides that&#39;s the way it should work anyway. Popular vote can be manipulated, but a history of right actions cant really as far as I can see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider also the use of chains of trust/recommendation both as the way to vouch for who is real in the election and to promote it.  </p>

<p>E.g., we create a new crypto (votecoin) [could be btc, this is just for illustration].  When you get one, you are able to &quot;register&quot; by sending a tenth from the same wallet to the &quot;registry&quot;.  Plus probably some sort of social media validation to avoid sock puppets.  Now you are registered and you get five &quot;votecoins&quot; to send to anyone you want to recommend.  If three of those register, you get two more, etc.</p>

<p>Because everything flows from a chain of trust, if false identities show up, it is trivial in the ledger to find out who sent the original invite (and maybe trim off that entire tree).</p>

<p>The <strong>biggest</strong> hurdle in my opinion is designing the website to be very &quot;web 2.0&quot; looking, something that the masses will be able to use simply but also look pretty. The reason for this is you need to appeal to someone who would be a guest on CNN, or your grandmother, or something along those lines. Don&#39;t make it for Redditors.</p>

<p>Keep it in the air of professionalism. You don&#39;t want it to be made a mockery of if this gains traction.</p>

<p>After the design elements, the security would probably be the next biggest thing. People will want to hack or dupe it for fraud very much.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If these two ideas can be solved, I think there is a VERY strong possibility that this can become something big. The media could pick it up and blow this big. They&#39;re already so obsessed with talking about 2016 that if there was a professional and respectable &quot;web vote&quot; going on at a fixed date with lots of interest, I believe they would be 100% into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the focus on positivity, but I&#39;m not sure what use this data will be? A small percentage of the population will use this, and much like the real election is skewed towards older people who are more dedicated to voting, this will be skewed towards pro-activism internet types, only to a much worse degree since the concept is even more self-selective. I like the idea in theory, but you can&#39;t even compare it against the real voting data to see what the demographic overlap is.</p>

<p>Not sure what the use of the results would be other than to promote the agenda that the election is essentially rigged to a two-party system, which may be true, but it is certainly not demonstrated by data like this. If it is used in that way, then to be honest, I think more than anything it would promote the stereotype many people have that conspiracy theorists will misrepresent data to make their point because they don&#39;t want to admit they were wrong about a conspiracy existing. And frankly, I can&#39;t imagine a situation in which 500,000 people vote 3/4 for Bernie Sanders and it <em>isn&#39;t</em> used as evidence that the election is rigged and the people want a third party candidate. They might, but that is definitely not the way you can prove it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a thing you learn about voting in upper-level poli sci or econ classes - as long as they&#39;re more on the empiricism/rigorous math end of the poli sci spectrum - when you cover game theory that really <em>should</em> change the way elections are held, but of course its never going to change for the better because that would make too much sense.</p>

<p>What you learn is that <strong>when votes are assigned a weight/value such that all people get 1 vote and all those votes count equally, people often made decisions based on things other than what candidate they really want to win.  It becomes an internal calculus that goes something like &quot;I really want to vote for candidate C, but my 2nd choice is candidate A, and I really don&#39;t want B to win, so I&#39;ll just vote for A to make sure B loses&quot;.  The way the system is set up, it doesn&#39;t matter if we let Nader or Ron Paul debate: the average voter&#39;s fear of, for instance, McCain becoming president, outweighs their true desire for Paul or Nader to become president.</strong></p>

<p>But <strong>if we instead decided that everyone&#39;s vote counts the same, but you&#39;re allowed to vote for 2 candidates, or if everyone was allowed to rank their preferences and go &quot;1) Paul, 2) Obama, 3) McCain&quot;, the entire political system of America would change, and elections would turn out <em>completely differently</em>.  The fear of wasting your vote would go away immediately, because you&#39;d get to vote for your true preference <em>and</em> your safety vote.  When they&#39;ve researched this, it totally changes the behavior of voters, and its likely that most elections would&#39;ve turned out differently.</strong></p>

<p>It would create an electoral environment in which 3rd parties would actually have a chance in US elections, which is why its never going to happen.  I mean, <strong>ask yourself: &quot;Why is 1 person-1 vote so sacred?  Why does that particular method of choosing political leaders have any more validity or imbue the winner with any more moral authority than other methods?&quot;</strong>  It doesn&#39;t, its just had the momentum of history behind it for centuries, and its outcomes are frequently less fair than other methods of election.  I mean, its winner-take-all... so <strong>49% of the 1/2 of eligible citizens who actually vote in elections actually get what they want... how is that fair?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>A sufficiently large group of people agreeing on actions essentially becomes the government.  </p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t need to be a revolution, a third party candidate, or a new constitution.  You simply provide a new online mechanism to allow people to vote and discuss in an organized and uncensored fashion.  Once enough people begin to use it and trust it enough to start ceding some power to it then that &quot;government&quot; becomes the defacto organization in charge - globally.</p>

<p>The trick is getting the mechanism right to get enough people to trust it so that that population (even the initial subset of people) is willing to cede some power to it (and be given protections under a core bill of rights).  A decentralized open-source network is needed (similar to a cryptocurrency network) to codify laws, with a modern and well studied voting algorithm (ie NOT the simplistic first-past-the-post voting algo that we use today).  A system of CAPTCHAs to prevent bots from voting, and voila - you&#39;ve just circumvented the entirety of human governments.</p>

<p>The efficiency and transparency of a completely open source and algorithmically driven system of laws is profound.  Enforcement is automatically executed in the code meaning there is no human bias or corruptibility in enforcement.  Imagine a world where there is no president - no congress.  Just a population of engineers and programmers setting up laws, beta testing them, and debating the formulas in a massive decentralized network of the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been reading the comments and Its great that this is getting some positive input.</p>

<p>I think there were a couple of points I wanted to address im reading peoples comments and its help us refine this idea so I think we should spend some time talking about how this work and if it would work and how to improve it if it can work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The point of this fake election (at least at first) is for it to be known that its not a real election. Its a political platform to be used to draw attention away from the real elections in a positive way, and when something negative goes wrong with it it just draws attention back to how corrupt our political system is. For instance say it gets hacked, I&#39;m hoping to work with vetted people to make it secure as possible but even if it did. All that would happen is that it would be a reflection of whats wrong with our current political system. Or at least in my head that&#39;s what I am thinking, maybe that wouldn&#39;t happen. The point is to make this a platform to point out the problems with the current election system as a first step by using the exact same process that is in use today. We use the flawed system only to draw attention away from it to bring people into an area where they can effect real change. Once we do that that and it gets popularity, then we can talk about making a real decentralized commonwealth with lots of leaders that are selected in a more direct way though vetting their online history. The idea one post commented on actually adding the real presidential candidates is a good idea, and it would show the contrast between what people really want and what our government is trying to feed to us.</p></li>
<li><p>Then we start working on process that can really do something to change. We could use that system to nominate leaders of commonwealths not by how may votes the person got, but how many right actions the person had, or how much of an impact those right actions had on the world. People can nominate others by casting an description of an event where that person committed a right action in that persons dossier. How did they choose to make a difference by the things they said online or off? and how did that difference effect change in the world? Those are the people we need as leaders, people that have a direct interest in making peoples lives better. We wouldn&#39;t actually have rulers that consolidate power. The power would be left to the groups and their decisions with the leaders helping people act on a already chosen decision that all the people in each group had a say in.</p></li>
<li><p>The title was used to describe the illusion the masses are still in that we live in a country of freedom for anyone who already knew that we don&#39;t.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>The participants (voters) would be highly self-selected and give a skewed illusion of actual popular support.</p>

<p>The more democratic ideal would be to have multiple scientific polls done by disinterested parties to gauge popular support for candidates at various times in the process, leading to the real election.</p>

<p>Oh, wait. I guess that&#39;s been tried and the results are not to your liking. Sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i like this idea.</p>

<p>years ago i had the idea to give every eligible american of voting age a pager which would send messages about things to vote on. </p>

<p>they could enter their vote via pager and it would be tallied up and the results be given to the appropriate agency.</p>

<p>The internet seems a better option nowadays, but not everyone has a capable phone/internet access. Maybe an inexpensive voting device can be given out at tax payer expense, and then we can maybe eliminate the costs and waste associated with paper voting.</p>

<p>I like the idea of the encryption protocols (SHA or Scrypt or colored coins) being applied here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im trying to think outside of the box on this. Im speaking to everyone in this community and abroad. My question is:</p>

<p>What if we made the elections based on a reputation point system alone?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first election would be the mock election that runs parallel to the real election and it would look in every way the same as the primary election.</p></li>
<li><p>My idea on our election is instead of using a majority vote, anyone can nominate a candidate for the election, but they cant nominate themselves. In the nomination the nominee submits information on the right actions of the persons history and why that person would be a good candidate to improve things.</p></li>
<li><p>People then vote on that person not by yea or nea, but by assigning points to that persons reputation. In order for someone to assign points they would have to have their own level of reputation that made that person trustworthy, so not just anyone can go in and vote. The person would have to develop a reputation of right actions in the community first before that person could vote. Something as simple as contributing to the community by posting a message about how to improve on a an important topic, or moderating community commets in such a way as to weed out shill behavior or what not. Not sure about the specifics of this yet but maybe someone can come up with other ideas. For the mock presidential election points could be assigned in the following ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>Right Actions history</li>
<li>Position Qualifications</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Instead, we would be voting on the right actions and qualifications of the candidate. I think this is an important distinction between voting for just the man. When we are focusing on right actions in our voting, we tend to move away from ego driven desires. People can be manipulated by ego driven desires based on emotion (Century of the Self points this out) . So if we are only focusing on the right actions of the candidate and the candidate himself will be focusing on right actions there isn&#39;t any need to be campaigning.  Everyone is putting their support in the right place without the need to prove anything.</p>

<p>For the people that have commented so far in saying they wouldn&#39;t support a mock election, you are not looking at the bigger picture. In the mock election we can show people a vision of how things could be. We need to start with that first or nobody is going to want to get on board with it. They wont want to switch away from our current system until we can show them how it will improve the current system.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where people are elected not by their words, but by their actions. </p>

<p>I also want to revisit the idea someone from a post over the weekend said. </p>

<p>Stop supporting corporations by buying or supporting what they&#39;re selling us. </p>

<p>you should look into this site.</p>

<p>I realize you&#39;re proposing something more structured to the popular vote, but there are huge synergies.</p>

<p>I think eventually there will come the need for strong P2P crypto and national-ID, which will need to be adopted to prevent the election fraud that has occurred in the past few runs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Attention tech entrepreneurs :</p>

<p>There is an open lane ready for taking right now. Just waiting to happen is a universal poll voting website. The website would be similar to reddit but ONLY for voting and less easy to create new accounts. The website would be for creating official global polls. It would he the gold standard for democracy. Let&#39;s call it say &quot;Consents-us&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;The US government still has drugs illegal but the official poll on consents-us only shows that 14% of people agree with that policy. &quot;</p>

<p>Not saying I agree or disagree with democracy. I&#39;m just saying there is a market open for the first tech dev that wants to take it. </p>

I think you&#39;d have much less difficulty actually getting participation with something digital in this day and age, and while I long for a good old fashioned protest, I think <em>some</em> action is better than none.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im trying to think outside of the box on this. Im speaking to everyone in this community and abroad. My question is:</p>

<p>What if we made the elections based on a reputation point system alone?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first election would be the mock election that runs parallel to the real election and it would look in every way the same as the primary election.</p></li>
<li><p>My idea on our election is instead of using a majority vote, anyone can nominate a candidate for the election, but they cant nominate themselves. In the nomination the nominee submits information on the right actions of the persons history and why that person would be a good candidate to improve things.</p></li>
<li><p>People then vote on that person not by yea or nea, but by assigning points to that persons reputation. In order for someone to assign points they would have to have their own level of reputation that made that person trustworthy, so not just anyone can go in and vote. The person would have to develop a reputation of right actions in the community first before that person could vote. Something as simple as contributing to the community by posting a message about how to improve on a an important topic, or moderating community commets in such a way as to weed out shill behavior or what not. Not sure about the specifics of this yet but maybe someone can come up with other ideas. For the mock presidential election points could be assigned in the following ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>Right Actions history</li>
<li>Position Qualifications</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Instead, we would be voting on the right actions and qualifications of the candidate. I think this is an important distinction between voting for just the man. When we are focusing on right actions in our voting, we tend to move away from ego driven desires. People can be manipulated by ego driven desires based on emotion (Century of the Self points this out) . So if we are only focusing on the right actions of the candidate and the candidate himself will be focusing on right actions there isn&#39;t any need to be campaigning.  Everyone is putting their support in the right place without the need to prove anything.</p>

<p>For the people that have commented so far in saying they wouldn&#39;t support a mock election, you are not looking at the bigger picture. In the mock election we can show people a vision of how things could be. We need to start with that first or nobody is going to want to get on board with it. They wont want to switch away from our current system until we can show them how it will improve the current system.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where people are elected not by their words, but by their actions. </p>
