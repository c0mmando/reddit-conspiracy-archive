    <div class="md"><p>The true meaning of puppet.  Cheney knew he had even less charisma and electability than George W. </p>

<p>The parallels between the Sloan to dei Holy Roman Empire and the United States today is quite alarming.  Those who truly rule do so from the shadow.  Through a face, such as Obama&#39;s.  When they fail, the failure is placed on the puppet, and the game reset for another attempt under a new puppet.  With Christie removed from being even a possible candidate, it appears as though the Clinton dynasty will be pushed as the next puppet ruler.  Her husband did such a great job as puppet during his puppet rule.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When George W. first came on the seem he was able to combine an everyman aw shucks demeanor with a physical vigor and charm that swayed a lot of people.  The only complaint against him was that he did not have the &#39;gravitas&#39; that Cheney brought to the ticket.  People found out later that gravitas was really just a cynical, grasping lust for power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama is a puppet.  He has the means, the power, and the backing to positively change the world, yet he does not.  This is a clear indication that he is owned, and is not calling the shots.  Partisan politics is the biggest sham alive today.  Meant to divide and conquer and make you feel as though you can change the world through the candidates you choose.  This is 100% incorrect.  You are living as a space.  With no voice.  No power as a human being.  Afforded only the small list of privileges they give you.</p>

<p>The only <em>change you.can believe in</em> is the change of skin tone.  He is a continuation of the <strong>exact same people</strong> who ruled prior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TQuite interesting, indeed.  You do understsand the reasons why that is, right?  It&#39;s discussed so often for once simple reason.  It&#39;s because much evidence points to it&#39;s gtuth.  Who has ran the Fed since it was signed in under distinctly less than honorable means.?  Criminal bullshit.  And who runs the private Federal Reserve today?  A group of transnational criminals solely responsible for sinking the USD over the last century.  Exactly what they were sold to us as them surele being able to prevent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does your brain allow you to see the obvious truths that are right in front of your face?. The truth has been exposed.  We haven&#39;t lived in a real democracy since the Bush/CIA/Mossad coup when Kennedy was murdered.  They&#39;ve held on to the power they stole since that time.</p>

<p>The reason it&#39;s so frequently discussed is...wait for it.....BECAUSE ITS TRUE.  All evidence points to this being the case.  And only very simple minds still ll believe the lies they were force-fed.  Are you a promoter of the same busted lies, or of the small brain variety?</p>
