<p>Repeat, down vote this, not because you disagree with what I say, but <em>because it doesn&#39;t belong on our front page</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m getting pretty sick of the memes.  Who do you think you are reaching with this bullshit?  More fucking retarded people to make us the laughing stock of reddit?  This is a fucking circle-jerk now, not a thinking ground.</p>

<p>Post/upvote shit that will inspire curiosity, not fucking &quot;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/25l9xl/this_is_shakira_she_was_left_with_these/">LEL, killing kids r bad</a>&quot;</p>

<p>Or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/25kbza/people_are_turning_michelle_obamas/">OMG so edgy!</a></p>

<p>These are the top three posts at the time of this writing, can we fucking get it together?  Can we at least <em>try</em> to be the change we want to see in the world?</p>

<p>It fucking sickens me that I consistently see the top posts on this sub violating the rules, and I&#39;d like to submit an honest inquiry to our mods:</p>

<p>What change in quality do you expect this sub to suffer if image posts were auto-removed?</p>

<p>Would it be awful to see people finding sources to back up their macro-claims?</p>

<p>Would it ruin it if submitters had to express themselves in paragraph form?</p>

<p>Would free-thinking cease if thought was required?</p>

<p><a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> : could you give me some feedback?</p>

<p><a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> : isn&#39;t this what you want?</p>

<p><a href="/u/weedtastic">/u/weedtastic</a> : isn&#39;t context important to you?</p>

<p>Edit: A picture is worth a thousand words, but those words are chosen by the viewer.  If you want your message to be heard, give it strength; it is foolish to gamble on beauty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with censorship, with control freaks, with meme nazis.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to get points across is images with pictures. When I see people blowing a gasket about text images I am reminded of the same censorship that happened in r/atheism. It destroyed r/atheism. Atheism text images used to hit the front page(all) of Reddit a lot before it was censored. Now just about none hit the front page. Those images had a big effect on a lot of people. </p>

<p>So when I see people talking the same talk as the censors on r/atheism, I know that most likely they are trying to stop content from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> hitting the front page, where it can actually change peoples minds and enlighten them.</p>

<p>Text with images are not memes and if they hit the front page, that&#39;s a good thing. If your concern is that they hit the front page, then you are an enemy of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>If your precious sensibilities are bothered by the adolescence nature of them, skip over them. Don&#39;t censor what I like. There is no way I would want to censor something you enjoy, unless it was illegal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An internet meme is an image which is re-circulated multiple times with different text, but all pertaining to a single theme.</p>

<p>Not all images with accompanying text are memes. A powerful, unique image accompanied by a political fact or statement can be a legitimate post. I think you know this, so it seems to me that you just don&#39;t like image posts. This is fine, and your best course of action is to simply ignore them.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think a broad range of different types of post is a good thing? As long as people post information in good faith (ie they aren&#39;t posting things they know or suspect to be false) I think we should be tolerant.</p>

<p>becoming</p>

<p>There you go again!  Still, it&#39;s nice to see some some relatively new blood.</p>

<p>As for shills, I wish we could rid ourselves of their lexicon.  I prefer the term Poe.  I adopted it under the principal of charity; when beliefs are so polarized it can be difficult to distinguish between a genuine fool and a clever ruse.</p>

<p>Personally, even in the event of paid infiltrators, what harm do they bring to us when treated like a new friendly face?  From the Lurkers perspective, a genuine concern is raised; wouldn&#39;t it be best to alleviate that concern rather than shout &quot;you were paid to say that!&quot;?</p>

<p>Shills, at worst, offer a soapbox for you to stand on.  A chance to express (even practice expressing) your point of view.  The only time they truly win is if we make asses of ourselves trying to shut down <em>our own fucking discussions</em> with assertions that they themselves are part of a conspiracy!</p>

<p>That is our own fault, as well as their hypothetical goal.  Let them call you names and lose their cool, come back calm, collected, and with sources to discuss.  Remember that someone disagreeing with you is not an enemy, but an objective (or even just practice, if you subscribe to shill-theory). Even in classical debate it is never about convincing your opponent, they already picked a side.  It&#39;s the judges, the audience, who award you points.  </p>

<p>Be a better person, be more prepared, be more persuasive. Capitalize some letters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A shill is someone who is paid to spread disinformation.  Shill theory is that if someone is spreading disinformation, they are a shill. It is a backwards way of thinking, like saying that because elephants are grey, my grey shirt is an elephant.</p>

<p>If you believe people are paid money to spread disinformation, why would you assume they are ineffective?  If the only people who disagreed with us were paid to we wouldn&#39;t be in this sub, would we?</p>

<p>Never accuse someone of being a shill.  Not because you may be wrong, but because you have nothing to gain from calling a shill out.  Because why would someone call a shill out?  Most because they &quot;want to spread the truth&quot; and those awful liars are ruining it.  So what?  Spread the truth to them (and also the audience).  Calling someone a shill is lazy, you may as well not respond.</p>

<p>I disagree with you. Meme&#39;s and PSA&#39;s are different and what we are seeing aren&#39;t memes. They are PSA&#39;s and many of them have already had their non-image sources posted here. If you don&#39;t like the PSA&#39;s then go someplace else.</p>

<p>The mod&#39;s and the people here are happy with them.</p>
