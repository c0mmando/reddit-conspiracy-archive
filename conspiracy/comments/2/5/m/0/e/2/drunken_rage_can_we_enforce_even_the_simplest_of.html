       It fucking sickens me that I consistently see the top posts on this sub violating the rules, and I'd like to submit an honest inquiry to our mods:
      </p>
      <p>
       What change in quality do you expect this sub to suffer if image posts were auto-removed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would it be awful to see people finding sources to back up their macro-claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would it ruin it if submitters had to express themselves in paragraph form?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would free-thinking cease if thought was required?

       I disagree with censorship, with control freaks, with meme nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the best ways to get points across is images with pictures. When I see people blowing a gasket about text images I am reminded of the same censorship that happened in r/atheism. It destroyed r/atheism. Atheism text images used to hit the front page(all) of Reddit a lot before it was censored. Now just about none hit the front page. Those images had a big effect on a lot of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when I see people talking the same talk as the censors on r/atheism, I know that most likely they are trying to stop content from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       hitting the front page, where it can actually change peoples minds and enlighten them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Text with images are not memes and if they hit the front page, that's a good thing. If your concern is that they hit the front page, then you are an enemy of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If your precious sensibilities are bothered by the adolescence nature of them, skip over them. Don't censor what I like. There is no way I would want to censor something you enjoy, unless it was illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you want to go to that other subby:

       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism

       was a default.  No one is seeing those memes unless they subscribe to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       .  At that point, it is a circle-jerk.

       It isn't about how I feel about them, it's how a newcomer freshly landing in our sub will view it.

       Try to wrap your mind around this. If the mods are legit and agree with the vast majority of the members, they will not agree with your censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get over it, move along with your life; it ain't gonna happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pics with text are a good thing. They are funny, insightful, entertaining and helpful to wake people up. Don't be against those qualities. Leave the dark side, come to the light. The world needs people like you to actually change things. Everyone agrees with that except a few censoring anti-conspiracy control freak meme Nazis.

       Your opinion is incredibly important. All it takes is a slight adjustment in your attitude. Then you will be helping humanity. That's a good thing.

       An internet meme is an image which is re-circulated multiple times with different text, but all pertaining to a single theme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all images with accompanying text are memes. A powerful, unique image accompanied by a political fact or statement can be a legitimate post. I think you know this, so it seems to me that you just don't like image posts. This is fine, and your best course of action is to simply ignore them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you think a broad range of different types of post is a good thing? As long as people post information in good faith (ie they aren't posting things they know or suspect to be false) I think we should be tolerant.
      </p>

       there is a difference between a meme and a PSA
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a clue

      <p>
       Edit: Further elaboration: a meme is a pic, this pic has text on it. Now the objective is to make you giggle slightly...
      </p>
      <p>
       A PSA is a pic, this pic has text on it, the objective is to bring awareness. No one laughs at all...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it is a thin line but please use your advanced brain and step back, looking at it for a moment to gauge "am I supposed to laugh at this or be made aware of something heinous"

       Meme has multiple definitions; technically, anything posted here the has the potential to be a meme, the common (reddit) definition is an image macro.

      <p>
       Outside the implication in the title,
       <del>
        I didn't indicate memes
       </del>
       (I was drunk!). I even took care to mention all image posts.

      <p>
       If you want to post an image, find a source for the information, then post it without an image.

       I disagree with you. Meme's and PSA's are different and what we are seeing aren't memes. They are PSA's and many of them have already had their non-image sources posted here. If you don't like the PSA's then go someplace else.

       As for shills, I wish we could rid ourselves of their lexicon.  I prefer the term Poe.  I adopted it under the principal of charity; when beliefs are so polarized it can be difficult to distinguish between a genuine fool and a clever ruse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, even in the event of paid infiltrators, what harm do they bring to us when treated like a new friendly face?  From the Lurkers perspective, a genuine concern is raised; wouldn't it be best to alleviate that concern rather than shout "you were paid to say that!"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills, at worst, offer a soapbox for you to stand on.  A chance to express (even practice expressing) your point of view.  The only time they truly win is if we make asses of ourselves trying to shut down
       <em>
        our own fucking discussions

       with assertions that they themselves are part of a conspiracy!

       That is our own fault, as well as their hypothetical goal.  Let them call you names and lose their cool, come back calm, collected, and with sources to discuss.  Remember that someone disagreeing with you is not an enemy, but an objective (or even just practice, if you subscribe to shill-theory). Even in classical debate it is never about convincing your opponent, they already picked a side.  It's the judges, the audience, who award you points.

       A shill is someone who is paid to spread disinformation.  Shill theory is that if someone is spreading disinformation, they are a shill. It is a backwards way of thinking, like saying that because elephants are grey, my grey shirt is an elephant.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe people are paid money to spread disinformation, why would you assume they are ineffective?  If the only people who disagreed with us were paid to we wouldn't be in this sub, would we?
      </p>
      <p>
       Never accuse someone of being a shill.  Not because you may be wrong, but because you have nothing to gain from calling a shill out.  Because why would someone call a shill out?  Most because they "want to spread the truth" and those awful liars are ruining it.  So what?  Spread the truth to them (and also the audience).  Calling someone a shill is lazy, you may as well not respond.

        But the majority has spoken time and time again to keep the pictures free, now uh... we do seperate memes from psa pics and we report memes to the mods with the quickness

       I disagree with you. Meme's and PSA's are different and what we are seeing aren't memes. They are PSA's and many of them have already had their non-image sources posted here. If you don't like the PSA's then go someplace else.

      <p>
       The mod's and the people here are happy with them.

       Content is here already. The addition of memes does not remove the other content, it just adds a bit of fun to the heavy vibe of this subby.

       Please don't take my lulz away.
