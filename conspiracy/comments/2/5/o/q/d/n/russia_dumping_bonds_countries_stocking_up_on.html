<p>and just realized how fucked young people are. They don&#39;t have jobs, they hate the government that is run by corporations and other shady interests, they are  lied to, their education is worthless, and many are at wits end. </p>

<p>I am wondering what is going to be the spark that starts the next civil war or uprising in the US.</p>

<p>What will define the next few decades, and possibly America&#39;s hegemony, is the creation of the TPP and TAFTA, isolation and division amongst BRICS and amongst Arabs. </p>

<p>Yet the recent Chinese-Russian gas deal, Palestinian reconciliation between Abbas and Hamas, and overall skepticism by the EU and Pacific nations against American led trade agreements (TPP, TAFTA), might undermine the future of pax-Americana.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have the tech to give everyone free education, healthcare, food and a small house, but our current system doesn&#39;t allow it. 
We sure should look into the number of people on this planet.
Less people means more space and stuff for everyone.</p>

<p>If you have one or two kids instead of 12 or 15, the planet will be less stressed in the future.</p>

<p>Henry Ford had 4 siblings.  Thomas Edison and JD Rockefeller both had 6 siblings.  </p>

<p>What good is more stuff, if no one knows how to put it to good use. </p>

<p>The biggest problem is that many existing people are stupid.  That won&#39;t change by fucking more carefully.  </p>

<p>It will change when people stop buying into the bullshit.  People will eventually understand that mom and dad don&#39;t both have to work full time because they &quot;need&quot; 2 big ass cars that get 13 MPG.  Cable T.V. that costs ~$120/mo, Smart phones for every member of their family, credit cards to buy groceries on, gadgets, knick knacks, shitty laminant flooring to impress the neighbors, Playstations, Ipads, DVD&#39;s, .99 cent apps, etc... And of course daycare, so that mom and dad can both work those full time jobs.</p>

<p>My brother and his wife have fallen into that trap and it makes me sad.  I work for myself, so that I can come and go as I want. In fact, I am leaving work in a couple of hours to go hang out with my kid at his school&#39;s fun day.  My wife works part time from home, so that she can be with our kids all day.  </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have shit.  No cable, no credit cards, nothing fancy.  2 old cars that are paid for, and my kids are advanced, to say the least.  We invest a lot of time in their education and creativity, so they better be.  </p>

<p>I am, by no means a rocket surgeon, but you don&#39;t have to be to raise good kids.  You just have to give them your time and attention.  Most people in the U.S. have traded that, for giving their kids shitty Chinese made stuff instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that in order for that to work, you have to also stop the morons from breeding. I sincerely believe we are heading for the &#39;Idiocracy&#39; future where all the intelligent people wait until later in life and then have 1-2 kids, whereas the trailer trash either don&#39;t understand how condoms work or are too stupid to work out that they can&#39;t afford to feed ttheir kids and pop out 8-9 of them. </p>

<p>And boom! Unsustainable levels of stupid people, breeding at incredible rates.</p>

<p>I honestly think that all of civilised society should have a 3 child maximum law, or maybe 2 children max unless you adopt.</p>
