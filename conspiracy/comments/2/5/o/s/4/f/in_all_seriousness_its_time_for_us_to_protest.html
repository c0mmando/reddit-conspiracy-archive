       This FCC-Net Neutrality bullshit has got to stop. I know some of us have jobs that we care about keeping, but sometimes the greater good of the country is more important than our own individual needs. Why doesn't the reddit community organize? Why don't we nut up and start this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw occupy, it was a joke. I talked to protesters in both Atlanta and NYC and both groups were full of incompetent hippies beating on drums smoking weed. WE talk about how smart we are and for good reason. WE are competent enough to do this. It's time for us to step the fuck up and stop the corporate bullying that is stripping our freedoms away piece by piece. We stopped SOPA, why shouldn't we actually make an effort to stop this?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know where else to post this so I'm posting this here. Fuck calling our "representatives" they don't represent our interests for shit. People around the world have hailed for us to step up and if we do, others will follow. Let's be the change we want to see and the change that we were promised.

       Over Net Neutrality? That's a little extreme, don't you think? It might be easier (and less deadly!) to campaign against the representatives who stand against you on this issue. Some crowdfunding to establish an organized PAC/Lobbying organization could have an impact.

       Even so, there has been virtually no organized opposition to these policies. Almost nobody is raising money, funding PACs that oppose these policies, lobbying their representatives. It seems extreme to jump straight to a bloody revolution (which would likely end up with thousands pointlessly dead and a situation no better than we're in now), instead of just trying to fight these policies using the tools we have.

       Rather high-horse it, divide us further by bashing Occupy, and ignoring the fact that MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of "us" actually put effort into keeping the status quo because it's safe, and people want safety. Posts like this are circle-jerk material since they offer no ideas or solutions, just complaints.

       That you think I'm a shill shows how little you're willing to do in terms of your own research on even the easiest of topics. You can click my username and actually see a history. It's not secret. That you confuse clear thinking, criticism, or commenting for shilling shows you aren't a part of any solution, and fall directly into the divide-and-conquer mindset you've been taught to fall into.

       Furst let me say, please excuse the loosely used word "idiot".  That being said, in your comment you say people want to be safe, and just have some sence of stability.  I believe you couldn't be more wrong.
Do you belive the Clive Bundy incident was just over a ranch?  PEOPLE (MILLIONS AND MILLIONS) have had enough.

       It certainly is, but I don't think it will happen just yet. People need to be fucked just a bit more.

      <p>
       What surprises me is in the post in r/videos about the guy at the FCC meeting smirking as protesters were removed there were a shocking amount of comments calling for his murder/assault, murder of politicians, comments expressing a hope that some psychopath or a hired hit-man starts killing politicians /1%/bureaucrats as a means to end govt. abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm afraid it will come to that. No protest, no boycott of a company, no letter/phone campaign will change the course because those assholes think they are untouchable and every violent thing those people commenting in that post called for will happen. It's just a matter of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       That sounds defeatist in a sense. But I really would support a cancel comcast movement because people don't need to miss a day of work or risk arrest to do that, and frankly that's a huge concern for a lot of people. If we could convince Netflix to give people like 3 months of free service for canceling Comcast, even if they were current members and could show they had and cancelled their service. That might draw enough support to rock the boat a bit.

       this "bullying" is a worldwide epidemic that has now engulfed the world to work in such a system to keep one another alive. One can't simply fight or change this. You want to make a difference you need to convince the military and all their personnel to turn against who they work for. And honestly that is never going to happen. Too many people are living well enough to keep the rest in misery.

       They really wouldn't care if a large number of political activists and educated people cancel their internet because most of their customers are idiots and with you off the internet they have even more power of influence online and less grief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protests don't work unless they are backed by Western NGOs and mercenaries that can turn things violent. They have the funding and the skill-set. Only violence gets noticed and only violence can create change. Rich politicians don't care about peaceful protests. They only care about their sponsors and their lifestyles. If you want to change things, you need to get rid of the cancer. Protests don't even amount to radiation treatment anymore. Surgical strikes are the only thing cancer will bend to.

       If we want to make waves then we'd need nothing short of massive protests. Eventually we're gonna see the lower and middle class staging massive protests in the streets. In 120 days when these regulations become effective and people see the implications, the comfort we've enjoyed won't be a reality anymore.

       Sitting behind your desk, waiting for something to happen is so easy. I argue that those people won't make it through the next couple decades. If we see another recession out of this, you won't be able to afford basic necessities, you'll just wither away and die.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what if we don't have a military? What are they gonna do, shoot us? That'll spark a fucking revolution. Complacent people sitting around watching the news and seeing their countrymen getting shot in the streets won't go hide in their homes. We're too proud

       The transiting won't impact much initially.   It will be a 5-7 year,  smooth transition of crippling power.  They aren't dumb enough to go from nothing to full retard in a day.   It will be subtle enough to keep the short attention spans of the masses oblivious to what is occurring.

       Make sure you get your permit to protest on that day, and stay within the "free-speech zone", don't wear masks, and definitely don't start marching.

       Once you have followed all these orders, have yourself a nice protest. /s

       Let's kick some ideas about how to get organized. These are my exact thoughts, and we need to organize others around this idea. I don't agree with violence, but there are other ways we can hurt them. simply by becoming a present, lucid, and vocal part of society we can hurt them, and by refusing to sustain their greedy corporations with our hard-earned money and refusing to follow their unjust laws. But collectively. You're spot on that we need to get together and take the risk.

       Civil disobedience. Opt out. A protest would require travel for too many. I keep racking my brain for something that we could all do to affect change. Net neutrality stuff is just a part of the major problem. It's the fed, the wars, the false flags and psyops, the cronyism, the sanctioned growth of actual fascism. Occupy was uneducated in their messaging and demands. We need to be on message. This system (not capitalism btw) has failed us and the federal government has grown too large, too powerful. Congress, the Supreme Court, and the executive branch are rife with such galling criminality, it's literally incomprehensible to the average tax slave.

       If this can get off the ground before the transitition, and the companies think the profit margins will not return, they will go back on their plan.

       There usually are alternatives pretty much anywhere, though you are right that the price may be different and the options.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually deal with carriers in many parts of the country on a regular basis.  If you're willing to pay quite a bit then there are a ton of options.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the cable companies do tend to have the lowest prices, while offering the best speed for those prices.   Yet they also have fair use and such that the only way to get around is to buy a small business version of.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my area I currently have Comcast, and I called around to several providers finding out what my options are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also...  what providers come into areas changes constantly.   If it has been 6 months since you shopped around it is worth doing so again.

       I don't think it's fair to call me a horrible person for complaining about Occupy. Did you talk to those people? Any of them? In any city?

       However, the cable companies do tend to have the lowest prices, while offering the best speed for those prices.   Yet they also have fair use and such that the only way to get around is to buy a small business version of.
