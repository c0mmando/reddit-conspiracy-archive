       Yeah, and who were the ones that actually accomplished any significant hacks (not just defacing pages/DDoSing, but gathering actual data)? It was lulzsec. Who was the ringleader for lulzsec? Sabu. Who was Sabu? An FBI snitch.

       You can talk all you want about Anonymous being comprised of individuals with their own goals, but having spent a year on their IRC server during their peak, it's a bunch of people playing follow the leader. There are some who go their own way, and they're cool, but they are definitely in the minority.

       In fact, a mass following in any one particular faction almost entirely assures the downfall of that faction.

       Not really. When lulzsec was up, they ran the show. They said jump, the rest of the community said how high. They were a small group, but they had a lot of followers. The twitter feed that Sabu ran was the flag that the community rallied around. For all intents and purposes, they were Anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
       There hasn't been one significant leak out of Anonymous since they went down. DDoSing and defacing don't accomplish one damned thing, yet that's all any of the minority factions got done. If you wanna call that capability, good luck with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And none of that is even accounting for the vast majority of the community that weren't hackers, just there to see the show. Point is, even if Anonymous isn't a psy-op, they are a neutered organization. Don't get me wrong, the ideals that it was founded on are solid, and something to believe in, but the Guy Fawkes mask isn't a symbol of power anymore, it's a joke.

       Sabu was the one who picked the targets. He was the organizer. He was a snitch for a year. That means, at the very least, he organized the Stratfor hack and the FBI let it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not even taking into account that the Arab Spring "succeeded" in large part to the organization efforts of Anonymous, all the while evangelizing TOR, which was developed by the US military. We can see how well that turned out. Reference Operation Earnest Voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have stupid fucking tools like LOIC and HOIC, which got a bunch of script-kiddies arrested, and accomplished nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manning and Snowden accomplished something with their leaks. Anonymous accomplished nothing except stirring up a beehive, and making money for the cyber-security industrial complex. The Sony hack and the Stratfor hack were a waste of time, just some dick waving, yet they were the perfect excuse to turn that NSA dial up to 11. The word "Cyber-terrorist" didn't even fucking exist until Anonymous came along. Don't get me wrong, they weren't terrorists, but they picked a fight with only one winner: The NSA. Cui Bono?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll admit that in their early days, when they were just fucking around with Scientologists, there probably wasn't any government influence. However, the organization by its very nature leaves it wide open for co-opting, and you'd be a fool to think that hasn't happened on a large scale.
