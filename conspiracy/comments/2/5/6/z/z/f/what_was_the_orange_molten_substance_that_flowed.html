       On 9-11 there was a flowing, molten substance that emanated from the corner of WTC 2 for minutes prior to it's fall.  I'm curious what science has proven this to be a product of and if there's anything of serious research out there on this.  What kind of material it was, what kind of temperatures would be required to produce this effect on said material, etc.

       Here's a link to the observation:

       FEMA did an analysis of some of the steel from building 7:
      </p>
      <p>
       A)
       <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">
        http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the photos of the sample in that pdf especially the first and second photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then look at the experiment that the guy did in this video @10 minutes 35 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       B)
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQu18DHuutU#t=10m34s">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQu18DHuutU#t=10m34s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The FEMA sample (A) and the steel cut by thermite in the video (B) look almost identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FEMA PHD's in material science could not figure out what caused the melting in (A). They did not analyse for explosives of accelerants. They asked that there be further study to determine what caused the melting. Take a wild guess if there was further study done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also look at the color of the smoke in the video and then look at the color of the smoke that blasts out of the windows ahead of the crashing towers. The color is identical.

       Def looks like molten steel to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless aluminum gets to about 4000 F, it's going to be silvery. Even slag from the smelting process is silvery.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, steel at about 2500 F turns a nice yellow-orange color, and will act exactly the way the video shows.

       Also, a thermite reaction reacts in a very similar manor.

        The red hot steel in the picture on the right shows that metal is over 2300°F
       </a>
       .  Even if the "aluminum" pouring out of the towers at it's melting point of 1220.58 °F, it still cannot transfer it's heat to the other steel objects around it making them hotter.  For example, if you pour a bunch of super hot aluminum( say +1400 °F) on a bunch of steel ibeams and rebar, it is physically impossible for it to warm that steel up to +2300°F.  It's like putting hot coffee in a thermos, only to find it way hotter 6 hrs later.

        Watch this short video where they pour molten aluminum into an anthill.

       I see some rebar and other metal scraps.  Aluminum pools into clumps.  It doesn't reshape itself back into steel i-beams.  And it doesn't maintain a heat level of over 1200°F for very long, let alone 8+ weeks.  The anthill was underground and well insulated by the dirt.

      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The internal energy of a system can be changed by heating the system or by doing work on it; the first law of thermodynamics states that the increase in internal energy is equal to the total heat added and work done by the surroundings.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So in order to achieve ground temperatures of +2800°F, which sustained themselves for +8 weeks, the whole entire system must have had added heat/energy from another source other than office fires and jet fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the towers collapsed,
       <strong>
        the heat put into the system was greater than +2800°F.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Jet fuel can only reach temperatures of 1800°F.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some interesting information..
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        1535ºC (2795ºF) - melting point of iron
       </li>
       <li>
        1510ºC (2750ºF) - melting point of typical structural steel
       </li>
       <li>
        825ºC (1517ºF) - maximum temperature of hydrocarbon fires burning in the atmosphere without pressurization or pre-heating (premixed fuel and air - blue flame)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Diffuse flames burn far cooler.
Oxygen-starved diffuse flames are cooler yet.
The fires in the towers were diffuse -- well below 800ºC.
Their dark smoke showed they were oxygen-starved -- particularly in the South Tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maximum jet fuel burn temperature is 825 Celsius.
      </p>
      <p>
       Temperature needed to melt structural steel is 1510 Celsius.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare this.
      </p>
      <p>
       On February 13, 1975, the WTC North Tower was beset by a fire, which "burned at temperatures in excess of 700°C (1,292°F) for over three hours and spread over some 65 percent of the 11th floor, including the core, caused no serious structural damage to the steel structure. In particular, no trusses needed to be replaced."

       There are so many problems here.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, it is myth that molten steel was found 8 weeks after collapse.

       Second, jet fuel is not the only thing burning, and the heat of the fire cannot be linked to the burning point of jet fuel.

       Dark smoke can come from oxygen starved fire. However, that is not the only thing that can cause dark smoke.

       Third, that fire in the 70s was minor compared to the 9/11 fires. Really, there is no comparision.

       Still doesn't explain how a system that can only get up to 1800 degrees by jet fuel, can reach temps of greater than 2800 degrees.  Some other energy was added to make it that hot.  Office fires and jet fuel cannot attain these temps.  You can take an abandoned 10 story building and pour 300,000 gallons of fuel on it, it would still never reach 2800 degrees.  Nope.

       This has been well discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fire stated by jet fuel is not limited to the burning temperature of jet fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       2800 degrees is not established as the temperature of what appears to be molten material flowing from corner (the topic if this thread).

       For some time I was satisfied with the reason being that it was molten aluminium from airplane fuselage and office material, until I discovered that molten aluminium is silvery, not orange/yelllow.

      <p>
       Thermite, on the other hand, produces a flow exactly like that with exactly the same color.

       Dirty aluminum?  Name another METAL that has 1)a melting point less than aluminum, and B) is capable of glowing red/yellow when molten.

       I wish you luck.  There is nothing that meets this criteria that would be available within the World Trade complex.

       metals are called metals because they melt and flow at certain temps, and the temperature is precisely color coded to visible temp.

       Why does it need to be less than aluminum? It just needs to be a melting point that was around the temperature of the explosion/fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Copper burns red/yellow when molten and has a relatively low melting point (1080 C). There would be plenty of copper in the building and probably some in the plane. 1080 C is a little over the estimate of the max burning temp of Jet A (~900) but not by much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the obvious one: Plastics. There would be literal tons of plastics in the plane and building. Plastics melt at very low temps (~75-260 C, well below the fire's burning temp). Check out this plastic on fire and dripping:

       K, you haven't proposed what those other materials might be, and when you do, how do their characteristics, mixing with aluminum, make this color possible, whereas aluminum couldn't produce this color it by itself, but when mixed into a "dirty ratio" with unknown material, it can?

       Concrete doesn't have a melting temp, it decomposes.

      <p>
       Ever seen wood or paper flow out of a fireplace?
      </p>
      <p>
       Carpet burns.  gypsum's melting point is 1400 C, so no way in hell we got to that temp with an office fire.  Don't know it's characteristics upon melting, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plastic burns at lower temps and would already be decomposing at these temps, not flowing.

       Have you ever tried to mix molten metal with any other material than another metal?  Go melt a stick of butter and a few lead sinkers from your pappy's tackle box and see what happens.

      <p>
       The fact that you lack even a basic understanding of this is quite surprising/shocking.  Yet you speak of possible scenarios that attempt to explain away the fatal flaws that summarily prove the fully engineered staged event on Sept 11.

       There are videos of a plethora of witnesses talking about seeing molten steel at ground zero a week+ after 9/11
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to find any mention of this in the NIST report.  Witnesses are only acceptable when they mesh with the official story. Same thing with the workers in the basement of WTC that were knocked down/lit on fire/injured by an explosion before the first plane hit.  Again, noticeably absent from the NIST report.

       Its like the television trying to tell you that the characters and world of Terminator 2 ars real, and the movie you were just shown is true reality.  Believe it!  These massive continuity, logic, and factual errors will not be addressed.  You still must believe its real.  Not a depiction fk reality, a capture of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course its goddamn molten steel. That is the only material present capable of glowing at that temperature and its the only material present capable of holding in that much heat for a period of well over a month.  Terminator 2!!! YOU MUST BELIEVE!

        Exclusive to American Free Press
       </p>
       <p>
        By Christopher Bollyn
       </p>
       <p>
        American Free Press has learned of pools of “molten steel” found at the base of the collapsed twin towers weeks after the collapse. Although the energy source for these incredibly hot areas has yet to be explained...
       </p>
       <p>
        In the basements of the collapsed towers, where the 47 central support columns connected with the bedrock, hot spots of “literally molten steel” were discovered more than a month after the collapse. Such persistent and intense residual heat, 70 feet below the surface, in an oxygen starved environment, could explain how these crucial structural supports failed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter Tully, president of Tully Construction of Flushing, N.Y., told AFP that he saw pools of “literally molten steel” at the World Trade Center.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tully was contracted after the Sept. 11 tragedy to re move the debris from the site.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tully called Mark Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI) of Phoenix, Md., for consultation about removing the debris. CDI calls itself “the innovator and global leader in the controlled demolition and implosion of structures.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Loizeaux, who cleaned up the bombed Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, arrived at the WTC site two days later and wrote the clean-up plan for the entire operation.
       </p>
       <p>
        AFP asked Loizeaux about the report of molten steel on the site.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Yes,” he said, “hot spots of molten steel in the basements.”
       </p>
       <p>
        These incredibly hot areas were found “at the bottoms of the elevator shafts of the main towers, down seven [basement] levels,” Loizeaux said.
       </p>
       <p>
        The molten steel was found “three, four, and five weeks later, when the rubble was being removed,” Loizeaux said. He said molten steel was also found at 7 WTC, which collapsed mysteriously in the late afternoon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction steel has an extremely high melting point of about 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit.

       Normal enough for the towers architect and builders to engineer the ability to withstand the fully loaded impact of multiple airliners travelling at top speed.  Physically engineered from the beginning to be able to withstand multiple (see: more than one) airliner impact.

       You straight up lose on speed issue, sorry…...
      </p>
      <p>
       A white paper released on February 3, 1964 states that the Towers could have withstood impacts of jetliners travelling 600 mph -- a speed greater than the impact speed of either jetliner used on 9/11/01.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707—DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact."

      </p>
      <p>
       Frank A. Demartini, on-site construction manager for the World Trade Center, spoke of the resilience of the towers in an interview recorded on January 25, 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it. That was the largest plane at the time. I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door -- this intense grid -- and the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting. It really does nothing to the screen netting"

       Did the paper factor in a plane crashing into the building at an angle not parallel to the ground, destroying multiple floors as it impacted?

       Do you have any idea how wrong that statement is? Clearly you dont, since this is the talking point that every truther uses. This point has been argued thousands of times. You cannot compare the WTC to ANY other building. They are simply not the same thing.

       Can you blame him? Conceding this means that everyone he knows that enlisted subsequent to 9/11 was fooled, that his friends may have died in vain. It means that his own job might have furthered these events. It could destroy his perception of his own life, friends, family, etc.
      </p>

       The argument today isn't about thermite or demolitions. It's about whether one's life has been so closely tied to those events that questioning them is wholly destructive to it.

       And the fact that both towers just happened to collapse at the exact point where a plane flew into them is what...coincidence? Really tough thermite cutter charges? All carefully planned?

       So the terrorists, who were trained in Arizona for a few months before and had absolutely no experience flying a real 767 - managed to hijack the planes and expertly fly them into the EXACT points of the buildings where explosive charges were placed, and without the charges being dislodged by the impact?
      </p>
      <p>
       And this was all part of the plan?

       It's the fantasy of partisan politics.  Those who stil buy into the fact this is only ever done to divide and conquer.  All the while perpetually stalling as to ensure nothing ever changes.  Long live the corporate party.  Long live corporate welfare.  Long live the fools who buy into divide and conquer.
