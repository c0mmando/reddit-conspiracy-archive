    <title>r/conspiracy: I made a post in askreddit asking why we as Reddit don't collectively donate a ton of money to "lobby" the FCC in favor of net neutrality after finding out Comcast only officially donated 75k or so to them. Was deleted after approaching 100 upvotes. Where SHOULD this be posted to gather attention?</title>

    <div class="md"><p>You broke the rules of that subreddit, why are you calling it &quot;blatant censorship&quot;? You just need to find the right sub to post it in. Just because it&#39;s a question, it doesn&#39;t need to go in a &quot;ask_____&quot; subreddit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 a) You must post a clear and direct question, and only the question, in your title. Any context, clarification, or conditions should be posted in the text box.</p>

<p>5) AskReddit is not your soapbox, personal army, or advertising platform. Posts attempting to promote a specific agenda of yours or anyone else, to gain publicity, promote a cause or charity drive, or to publicly shame a person or entity will be removed. Rhetorical and loaded questions will also be removed.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a place to recruit members for a cause, highlight an individual or entity for positive or negative publicity, or toot your own horn. Also, do not make posts or edits asking for upvotes or downvotes. Attempting to gain support for a movement, rig a contest, or form a vote brigade on reddit will result in immediate post removal. We&#39;re not here to do your bidding.</p>

<p>7) Soliciting money, goods, services, or favors are not allowed. They will be removed.</p>

<p>This ties back in with rules 2, 3, 4, and 5. Gaining publicity for a charity drive, assistance with a homework or work assignment, or asking other redditors to provide you with a good or service, is not conducive to discussion. There are other subreddits, many listed in our Offers &amp; Assistance Multi-reddit, for just such a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t think of these as private corporations,  they are heavily subsidized by your tax money in several ways, the development, costs and research, 
government contracts, tax subsidies for infrastructure and more.  </p>

<p>They are welfare queens and you pay for their profits via taxes, as above and this really sick way, tax money, to contractor, to lobbyist, to elected&#39;s campaign: your tax money pays the lobbyists.  </p>

<p>Fees and tax money already provide sufficient profit, they are once again almost a monopoly and Comcast in particular now has a broadcast company, (NBC) and wants the cable company Time Warner. 
They want communications monopoly,  so does that shadow government we talk about here, now and then.  If all information from one source, things will be so much easier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why you&#39;re getting downvoted because this is 100% correct. People really need to learn the difference between lobbying and pure bribery. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re spending 75 grand on lobbying the FCC, you&#39;re basically paying for someone to talk to FCC officials and tell them what your company wants the FCC to do. The FCC doesn&#39;t receive this money, and the idea is to pay someone with influence and contacts in the FCC to be your lobbyist. Sure, sometimes lobbyists might promise a congressman campaign money for re-election in exchange for his vote, but this kind of &quot;bribery&quot; isn&#39;t something that can occur in an executive agency like the FCC.</p>

<p>Edit: added some stuff for clarity</p>
