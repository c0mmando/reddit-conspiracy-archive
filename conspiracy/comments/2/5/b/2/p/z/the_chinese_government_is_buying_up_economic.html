        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-05-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Persona_Manager.html">Persona_Manager</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>America is for sale and the communist Chinese are eager buyers.  The Chinese government is using sovereign wealth funds and Chinese state-owned enterprises to buy up economic assets and huge tracts of land all over the United States.  Many of the politicians hail all of this &quot;foreign investment&quot; as something that is &quot;good for America&quot;, while many others see something much more sinister going on here.  In any event, this is a trend that is rapidly accelerating and that is causing great concern among patriotic Americans.</p>

<p>In an article entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2010/12/31/1472023/chinese-company-eyes-boise.html">Chinese company eyes Boise</a>&quot;, a potential deal that Sinomach (a company controlled by the Chinese government) wants to do with the government of Idaho. This is a phenomenon that is happening all across the United States. The following is a description of that project:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Chinese national company is interested in developing a 10,000- to 30,000-acre technology zone for industry, retail centers and homes south of the Boise Airport.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>30,000 acres is close to 50 square miles. That is a huge chunk of territory. All of this is a part of &quot;<a href="http://accelerate.idaho.gov/">Project 60</a>&quot; – a huge initiative to revitalize the economy of Idaho.</p>

<p>Another example, a Chinese investment group is buying up a very large chunk of real estate in Toledo, Ohio.  The following is a brief excerpt from an article in the <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2011/05/26/Chinese-investors-renew-interest-in-purchasing-Marina-District.html">Toledo Blade</a> on May 26th, 2011: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dashing Pacific Group Ltd., which has already purchased the nearby Docks restaurant complex for $2.15 million, put its $3.8 million offer to buy the southern 69 acres at the Marina District in East Toledo back on the table for approval by Toledo City Council. Additionally, Dashing Pacific Chairman Yuan Xiaohong, in a letter signed in Hangzhou, said the firm wants a two-year option to buy the decommissioned Toledo Edison power plant property on the site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even more disturbing is what has been happening down in Texas.  The Chinese have been gobbling up oil and gas fields.  The following is a quote from one local <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/business/local/article/China-stakes-claim-to-S-Texas-oil-gas-858329.php">Texas news source</a> about one of these deals:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>State-owned Chinese energy giant CNOOC is buying a multibillion-dollar stake in 600,000 acres of South Texas oil and gas fields, potentially testing the political waters for further expansion into U.S. energy reserves.</p>

<p>With the announcement Monday that it would pay up to $2.2 billion for a one-third stake in Chesapeake Energy assets, CNOOC lays claim to a share of properties that eventually could produce up to half a million barrels a day of oil equivalent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/195245-cnooc-not-so-secretly-buying-up-worlds-oil-reserves">You can read much more about this particular deal here.</a></p>

<p>CNOOC (China National Offshore Oil Company) has been buying up oil and gas assets all over the globe.  They seem to have an insatiable appetite for them.</p>

<p>There is not much that can be done about what is going on in other countries, but when Americans allow foreigners to buy up precious oil and gas assets, shouldn&#39;t that set off &quot;national security&quot; red flags?</p>

<p>Not that politicians are too concerned about real national security issues anyway.  They just keep telling us that we will be just fine as long as we allow the TSA to grope our wives, our children and the elderly. </p>

<p>Getting back to the topic, shouldn&#39;t we be alarmed that someday soon America may be importing &quot;foreign oil&quot; that is being pumped out of Texas? It is almost as if virtually all of the politicians have lost all common sense.</p>

<p>The state of Idaho is actually touting the EB-5 program that promotes Project 60. Chinese state-owned companies would probably hire a small number of Idaho citizens.  The idea would be for &quot;special economic zones&quot; to be set up inside the United States that would be very similar to the &quot;special economic zones&quot; inside China.</p>

<p>The following is how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Economic_Zone">Wikipedia</a> defines special economic zones:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is a geographical region that has economic and other laws that are more free-market-oriented than a country&#39;s typical or national laws. <strong>&quot;Nationwide&quot; laws may be suspended inside a special economic zone.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently the government of Idaho believes that allowing the Chinese to set up a 50 square mile &quot;special economic zone&quot; just south of Boise would be a grand idea, but others are not so sure.  Barbara H. Peterson posted the following on <a href="http://farmwars.info/?p=6247">Farm Wars</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not a boom to Idaho, but a death knell for those who are rapidly losing jobs to overseas outsourcing, only this will be so much more convenient for the mega-corporations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, the cost of transportation is rapidly going up.  If state-owned Chinese companies can set up shop inside the United States and get massive tax breaks from state and local governments at the same time why wouldn’t they want to do it? 30 years ago, the Chinese economy was absolutely pathetic compared to the U.S. economy. But now they have almost surpassed the US. Why?</p>

<p>Well, the US shipped them thousands of our factories, millions of jobs and trillions of dollars. It is insane what America is doing. The Chinese are starting to colonize the US. </p>

<p>Would America have ever allowed the Soviets to come in and buy up companies and buy up huge tracts of land all over the country? Yet somehow the US has become convinced that it is okay for the communist Chinese to do it. In fact, we even allow the Chinese to make many of the key electronic parts for our most advanced weapons systems. It even turns out that some &quot;counterfeit electronics&quot; from suppliers in China have gotten into some of our military hardware.</p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/print/article/20110614/DEFSECT04/106140304/2-U-S-Senators-Slam-China-Military-Parts-Probe">article</a> noted that &quot;counterfeit electronics had &quot;infiltrated&quot; the Pentagon&#39;s supply chain, including microprocessors for the F-15 fighter jet and microcircuits for US Missile Defense Agency hardware.&quot;</p>

<p>Now China is even blocking an investigation into these &quot;counterfeit electronics&quot;.</p>

<p>The US has become dangerously dependent on China. In fact, if the relationship with China went south, there would be a lot of weapons systems that we would suddenly not be able to get parts for. The people that originally decided that it was a good idea for China to produce electronics for our planes and weapons systems should resign immediately. We are allowing the Chinese to dominate us in hundreds of different ways. As China becomes wealthier and as the United States becomes poorer, all of this is only going to accelerate. China is going to become even more dominant in the years ahead. Should we all start learning to speak Chinese?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>China is investing everywhere it can. It needs a way to dump all its US dollars while still maintaining a strong national currency. China is aiding Africa with billions in US dollars. I am not sure if it means that China is actually aiding with US dollars, or comparing what the actual value of the Chinese aid is to US currency. If China is loaning or purchasing in US dollar, this means African countries will begin using American currency. More world players.</p>

<p>Edit: Should also add in about the US and Russian political theater that has been covered in various news outlets. Russia and China are working together while US-Russian relations deteriorate. Especially with recent announcements such as US no longer sharing NASA tech or cooperation, and China planning to launch over 30 sattlites by the 2030s.</p>

<p>FYI China is not a communist nation, I lived there August 2011 to November 2013, rather it is a one party state with aggressive expansionist capitalism as its agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money talks. Everything is for sale even this country you live in and love. Take heart. Its not as if the Chinese are going to take over our entire country and displace our current government forcing us to live under communist rule...  seriously though. globalization is around the corner so get used to new neighbors or move to an island somewhere.  China and the USA have a love hate relationship. Cant live with em cant live without em. </p>
