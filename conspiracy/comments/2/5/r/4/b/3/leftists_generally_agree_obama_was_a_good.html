If I were to believe that he honestly thought he could do the &#39;hope and change&#39; thing, that would mean that something changed him.... so, I wonder, what was it?  Was he born in Kenya?  Does he fondle babies?  There has to be something seriously fucked up (I would think) for him to disregard his promises (i.e. net neutrality, Guantanamo, etc)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the pattern that is developing is that they&#39;re progressively (pun not intended) getting worse, regardless of their party affiliation. People thought Bush was bad. He merely set the stage for Obama to take things even further. If things were as they should be, you and other leftists could argue with rightists all the live long day about your ideological views on how we should best run the country. We could go with a left guy one election, and then maybe elect a legit conservative another election... and we&#39;d get through each one of them just fine, running the &quot;great experiment&quot; as it was intended. We would do just fine.</p>

<p>Regardless of who wins in 2016, things <em>will</em> continue to get worse. I think it will take one or two more national election cycles before people start to get the picture that these guys are all liars and puppets of an agenda that is detrimental to the core principles of the United States and the Constitution. That agenda is being slowly dragged out into the sunlight. The people may never wake up... but I think things are becoming more apparent for the average Joe by the day, if they&#39;re paying attention. The question is will enough people have the courage to do something about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think courage is a nonstarter. Virtues in general are harder to achieve than being upper middle class anymore. Of course I would love it if people just started doing sit-ins en masse, finding ways to avoid paying income tax, refusing to consume for a period of time blah blah but that just ain&#39;t gonna happen. If we&#39;re gonna get anything done, people need to become uncomfortable and real quick. Take away netflix and TV dinners and take out overnight and then we might see some real patriots emerge. I hope I am wrong though and that the scenario you imply in your second paragraph does actually happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone paying attention knew Obama was a bad pick long before he got into office.  I guess the term &#39;bad pick&quot; may be subjective, but what I mean is that anyone should have known that he wanted to alter the things that have been the foundational principles of the US for hundreds of years.</p>

<p><a href="http://macsmind.com/wordpress/2008/10/obama-in-september-of-2001-the-us-constitution-represents-the-fundamental-flaw-of-this-country-that-continues-to-this-very-day/">example</a></p>

<p>In that interview, he says the constitution is fundamentally flawed, and he advocates using the judiciary branch to circumvent the checks and balances of the US system.</p>

<p>In general, extreme &quot;leftists&quot; are as grossly deceived as extreme conservatives.  They both make a fatal error when they assume that there is a subset of politicians who are looking out for their best interests.</p>

<p>The US system as it is today is not one of [good versus evil] It never was, and it never will be.  Ideally, it would be a system of good versus good.  Today it&#39;s pretty much evil versus evil.  Actually, it&#39;s not even evil versus evil.  It&#39;s just one team putting on an evil versus evil puppet show.</p>

<p>Personally, I would say that the flaw in your thinking when you say &quot;Leftists generally agree that Obama was a good candidate...&quot; would be the flaw that assumes leftists are not generally deceived (thus capable of making good judgements)  They may be slightly less deceived than &quot;rightists&quot;, but not enough to make any statistical difference.</p>

<p>But baby steps bro.  I assume you are already aware that conservatives only exist to dick you around.  That&#39;s almost half way there.  Once you figure out that Leftists also only exist to dick you around you will be at least 86% there!  so you&#39;re making progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t stop torture, that will never end, it&#39;s just hidden better. He didn&#39;t invade Iraq or Afghanistan, but he tried to invade Syria.

He&#39;s expanding mass surveillance of the world&#39;s innocent civilians. He&#39;s made the richest .01% wealthier than they&#39;ve ever been.</p>

It&#39;s not … I&#39;m not a fucking conspiracy nut, it&#39;s provable. A handful, a very small elite, run and own these corporations, which include the mainstream media. I have this feeling that whoever is elected president, like Clinton was, no matter what you promise on the campaign trail – blah, blah, blah – when you win, you go into this smoke-filled room with the twelve industrialist capitalist scum-fucks who got you in there. And you&#39;re in this smoky room, and this little film screen comes down … and a big guy with a cigar goes, &quot;Roll the film.&quot; And it&#39;s a shot of the Kennedy assassination from an angle you&#39;ve never seen before … that looks suspiciously like it&#39;s from the grassy knoll.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is a little bit of both. Politicians know the game they&#39;re playing, which is that their primary goal is to get elected and their secondary goal is to get re-elected. So they will say and do what gets them elected before other considerations about, you know, helping people and maintaining infrastructure and whatnot. Tickling peoples&#39; hope glands got him elected and being a lesser evil than mitt romney got him reelected.</p>

<p>I suspect he knew he&#39;d have to break all his major promises one way or another. What I&#39;m not sure about is the ratio between how evil he is and how much he has been threatened or blackmailed or paid off by CIA/big business/whoever into breaking his promises. </p>

<p>Bottom line is nobody who could really change the game is going to be allowed to be president at this point unless citizens start to get rowdy of their own volition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you accept that he believed the rhetoric he used to campaign, then yeah, he must have either been compromised or the realities of being president prevented change. I&#39;d say the second scenario is more probable. Government exists primarily to preserve the status quo, so radical change of direction will likely be very hard to effect. People in the executive are used to doing things on a certain basis and you&#39;d need to change their outlook.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s more probable than that, I think, that he simply didn&#39;t believe the stuff he said, or at least not wholly, and either doesn&#39;t care to work that hard for something that he isn&#39;t sold on, or was never intending to.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;d go with the second scenario. I think we know that only approved candidates get to run for political offices at this level with any coverage. Sops are tossed to incumbent officeholders like Kucinich, or Paul, and will be to Sanders if he runs, but the system foils them at every turn, mainly through lack of coverage and through ridicule. So how did Obama get by the &#39;paywall&#39;, so to speak? His rhetoric wasn&#39;t too far off of Kucinich?</p>

<p>Obama, a black man, unknown outside of Ohio, named similarly to our most recent arch-enemies, comes out of nowhere to embarrass Clinton, Dodd, Edwards, Kucinich, Richardson and Biden. You know, in every endeavor that power undertakes with any seriousness, there is layer upon layer of failsafes to ensure success. Warfare is the obvious analogy. I don&#39;t see why political leadership would be left to twist in the wind with the vagaries of the citizenry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same as the script for Carter, Clinton, Obama&#39;s turn now.  I think Obama&#39;s holding up a bit better than Clinton did.  It isn&#39;t the kind of blackmail, personal in nature that is the blackmail.  </p>

<p>This is conspiracy, I am certain you can figure it out, think of underwear bomber just before the stimulus fight, what about stock market drop ay of 2011 just before the first gov. shut down budget, that debt default stand off and finishing with the budget sequestration deal. </p>

<p>Do some speculating on what/how people with nearly unlimited power can do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has carried on, and extended fully, the Bush/Clinton fronted oligarchy that has caused serious harm to both our economy and our reputation around the world.  He has also pulled a 180 on many important campaign promises such as transparency, ending the violation of our rights, etc.  </p>

<p>To be honest, if you have followed the conspiracy trail on Obama it runs super deep.  Apparently, he could be the Reptilian clone of one of the major Egyptian pharaohs brought to life to usher in the end of days as the Antichrist.  Michelle is the clone of Nefertiti and could actually have been brought back as a man who played NCAA football at Oregon State, before turning into Michelle and forming the unholy union.  </p>

<p>Yeah, it just keeps getting crazier by the minute the further you go down that rabbit hole.  Some of it is just right wing shills fear mongering (think Alex Jones), some of it is people off their meds (think Obama went to Mars in 71 with Jimmy Hendrix), and some of it is probably true(think there is no Republican or Democrat).   </p>
