        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Howdy Folks, </p>

<p>This movie was something else.  It wasn&#39;t a summer blockbuster intended to numb with mindless entertainment.  It was something far worse.  I don&#39;t want to put on my tinfoil hat, I&#39;ll do that at the end but I think that this media, like everything else we&#39;re fed falls into line with an idea I&#39;ve come across in psych and anthro journals.  Society and the media that makes it up is a two way street.  They are trying to reach us for control, or money or what have you and we as a people, are trying to let them entertain us.  So, on to the movie:</p>

<p>First off, the movie rehashes the biggest disasters we have faced in the last 20 years or so.  It had scenes reminiscient of: the tsunami in both Japan and Thailand, The Fukushima disaster (obvious and really hamfisted in the way they try and show us how TEPCO really fucked up and is hiding something), the Earthquakes in Peru, Japan and even the famous San Francisco one, falling buildings (ala 9/11).  It even graces us with a nice little image of a Katrina-esque scenario in which a black family is very obviously happy and reunited.  It seemed obvious.  Why choose those actors in THAT place?  There was another shot of reunification earlier in the movie but those folks were Japanese.  Why is this important?  I think the MSM does this little song and dance every time there isn&#39;t something man made going on.  It reminds us, &quot;Look how fragile we are!  Look how scary the unknown is!  BE AFRAID!&quot;  It&#39;s part of a greater context on fear, control and induced xenophobia in our culture.  It&#39;s a cheap tactic on behalf of the film makers.  If they were trying to stun us with levels of devastation that would really &quot;hit home&quot; then I guess that was the point.  I would believe it if...</p>

<p>The movie wasn&#39;t a giant military circle jerk.  Every major character was affiliated with the military.  They were all heroes, there were no assholes killing civilians.  The main guy, who happens to be the face of the military has a loving wife.  She&#39;s so stereotypical as a caregiver she&#39;s even a fucking nurse.  They live in a really nice house that they could never afford in San Francisco to show people IMO (YOU COULD HAVE ALL THIS IF YOU JOIN!).   </p>

<p>There are obvious links to gaming and media.  The main character has an EOD designation and they do a HALO jump.  There is great amounts of propaganda to show that nuclear weapons are our friends and useful and that the US is a tightly running machine full of selfless heroes.  Some folks are, some aren&#39;t.  The US is shown to be able to tread on many countries without actually involving the people they are treading in.  They spend time in the Philippines and in Japan and yet the citizens are nothing more than backdrop for our story.  I think it screams of cultural narcissism.  The way the ethnic groups are show also bothered me.  The people of the philippines were shown to &quot;swarm&quot; over an area.  They didn&#39;t really speak.  They just labored in a mine.  Like ants, they go about their tasks and don&#39;t even bother to look up.  The history of US/Philippine relations is a creepy complex one I think it&#39;s worthy of conspiracy theory.  The Japanese are mostly faceless except for a few minor ones and Watanabe.  Again, a careless treatment of a people that spawned the Kaiju film.  They are also shown as extremely dense and subservient.  Unwilling to break protocol to do the &quot;right thing&quot;.  I think that has very heavy implications in US policy abroad.  The military hierarchy in the film maybe I&#39;m making too much of it but the face of the grunts was Morales a Hispanic (there were a few others shown but didn&#39;t give any time so I don&#39;t think they fit in the narrative).  The middle tier man was American Black and top tier were white/Ashkenazi jews. I don&#39;t know if this is a stratification done on purpose or not but I thought it important to point out.  Is this a movie reflecting what&#39;s true in our current society or MSM manufacturing a status quo? </p>

<p>Yes, there are big monsters and yeah it&#39;s impressive in its scope but I think that without getting too much into hard film critique this movie is a mirror.  It&#39;s MSM selling us a picture of ourselves and we fucking love it.  </p>

<p>Tin foil hat time:   </p>

<p>All the leaders of the military groups are Jewish.  Not that it may matter but it struck me as strange that all those people doling out orders were obviously ethnically Jewish.  (I probably lost like half the readers here, so I&#39;ll stop that thread and let see if any of you saw something similar or I&#39;m just retarded).  To follow this idea of ethnic Jewish presence in the film I keep noticing shows and movies where a Jewish guy ends up marrying or dating a blonde woman.  Mad About you, Meet the Parents, Most of Jerry&#39;s Girlfriends in Seinfeld this movie is no exception.  I have no idea why this exists or if I&#39;m seriously cherry picking. </p>

<p>There is a secret organization called Monarch which seems to be above international borders.  The name itself is creepy and you are all well aware of the implications.  </p>

<p>There is a huge shot with a large number 88 that just caught me off guard.  I did a bit of looking into it and it doesn&#39;t seem to mean much to the context of the movie.  The number itself is sort of mired in racist context.  There is a scene where the main soldier gives a little boy a toy soldier to entertain him.  This same toy belonged to the main character and he later went on to become part of the military.  Is this a subtle nod to indoctrination techniques?  During the Halo jump there were either 12 or 13 flares coming down showing 13 distinct streaks(I may have counted wrong I was sleepy).  The number goes without saying, it&#39;s important to a lot of people. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it.  I&#39;m stopping now.  Sorry for the essay I just wanted to get out what I found disturbing in the movie.  There was a whole lot more but I wanted to start a conversation and not write a tome on the subject.  </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Edit: 
TL;DR:  Creepy scenes to remind us of disaster, Military Circle Jerk, FEMA involvement, interesting Ethnic placement in the film.  Secret organizations with the name MONARCH out to do &quot;good&quot;.  Insulated and grossly narcissistic American view of the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a fair point to make but the ones you chose to highlight are iconoclasts.  Their  vision of how things should be definitely highlights their penchant for symbolic language.  Why was Schultz German?  Why was the Django movie a German saga in the old west?  Why was Kill Bill 1 an homage to Samurai and Kung Fu movies in the 70s and why was Kill Bill 2 a Spaghetti western?  Nolan&#39;s use of grit and dark tones in the Batman movies as well as his casting choices show that he cares very much for symbol.  Ledger wasn&#39;t a fluke.  They chose a handsome man that people loved and saw what he could do to bring people in.  Likewise, the color palette the costumes, the shots done a certain way (the motion cameras for fight scenes) are all meant to elicit certain reactions through symbolic imagery. I won&#39;t even get into Kubrick.  They teach masters courses solely on his work.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make valid points, however most successful directors integrate symbolism into their work. It is a key part of the medium across the board. It&#39;s one of the intrinsic values of filmmaking that has help drive our interests in watching movies as a form of entertainment. This takes me back to my original comment, most movies are just entertainment and not meant to serve as some sort of grand conspiracy. Yes film can be a powerful propaganda tool but these days most Hollywood features are made with the intent of making profit before all else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 50/50 on Tarantino myself. His early work tended to lift a considerable amount from Hong Kong cinema of the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s. However, his name appears in this forum simply because he is one example of a director that did not attend film school. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If argue r-dogs isn&#39;t very well directed, but its almost good enough to watch again just to complain about how poorly it is directed.  Though I doubt you&#39;re that interested in my synopsis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would love to see one of the first feature length films that you have written and directed. Please let me know the title and so I can compare it to a film like reservoir dogs that was widely praised by critics. After that I would love to watch your follow up work so I can compare it to other works of Tarantino to see how your film making and script writing might stand above his work. Then I want to totally forgo viewing your last two full length features because I doubt that they could be of any quality since it is likely that I will not like at least one of your prior films. </p>

<p>Or simply tell me how you would have directed RD better since you seem to be an expert. </p>

<p>I see Gojira that saves San Francisco from the attack of two monsters of insane power as a way of making the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima a good thing, as the outcome of this event resulted in the ending of this torment that was attacking the US and possibly the whole world after it was done with America</p>
