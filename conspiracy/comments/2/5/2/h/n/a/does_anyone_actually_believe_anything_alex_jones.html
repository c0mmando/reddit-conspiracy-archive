       Yes. He goes overboard with the "They're trying to make you a woman" stuff but he is doing serious journalism. He broke Benghazi months before Seymour Hersh published pretty much the same story. He exposed Bohemian Grove once and for all. He was doing interviews with Russ Tice and William Binney back in 2004. He was telling everyone that the NSA was spying on everyone loooonnnnngggg before Snowden was even out of college.
      </p>

       So hate him if you want but he is a credible source. Don't believe him on his word because you shouldn't believe anyone on their word. Fact check everything he says.

       I agree that he could be in the Knights of Malta or could even take money from Mossad (his wife is Israeli and he will never mention a peep about Mossad while he will rant and rave about the CIA). But it is clearly not pure bullshit. Only recently, he was the first one to say Benghazi was a CIA gun running plot. He broke that story before it was confirmed by Seymour Hersh and the Washington Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does he act like a nutball and is he annoying a lot of the time? Yes. Is he pure bullshit? Hell no. He was the first one film satanic rituals at Bohemian Grove. He proved it when it was all just a crazy conspiracy theory.

       I think you're thinking of Bill Cooper. AJ just took his material and ran with it once Bill was put down. The fact that Bill is dead, and AJ prances around on TV like an imbecile is more than enough to convince me AJ is a shilly untrustworthy cocksucker.

       Or you can bypass that and listen to Mr. Goldstein discuss it with some "friends" by listening to the "Off-the-hook" archives from 2600. They were publishing articles on Magic Lantern and Carnivore, at about the same time.

       Great site. Thanks for showing it. But it only goes back to April 2, 2014. I can't find any archives. Do they focus just on NSA spying or are they privy to the Alien Disclosure in 2004:
       <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/ufo/key_to_et_messages.pdf">
        http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/ufo/key_to_et_messages.pdf

       That doc is directly hosted by NSA.

       You have to be selective of ALL media outlets.  Whether it's left wing, right wing, or a wild accusation by an Internet source, they all have an agenda.

       I think bill cooper had a better idea of how the alien agenda plays  into the hierarchial   structure of what the source of   power is  but Alex Jones is clearly   an   ideologue. He  wants to sell  you something every chance   he  gets but doesn't report on science conspiracies  or alien conspiracies that would challenge his revenue stream.

       I only like watching his show when people other than him are hosting it. He is  really rambunctious and fails to even  let his guests speak some times to interject the  same thing he spent  the last  half hour talking about..

       Infowars  is a better news  source than  the msm  but not by  a large  margin that's for sure.

       He is super accurate when it comes to history, documentation, and just showing what the MSN itself reports.  but then he puts his stupid old school radio persona/ doom and gloom spin on everything to make the whole topic seems dumb.  Whether he is some CIA dude, or just suffers from radio persona is up to the individual to decide.

       He's hit and miss. Sometimes he's bang on and other times he's out in left field. At the end of the day he's a positive because he's getting alternative views out there.... even if he does it in a salacious way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with being a doomsayer is that the world doesn't fall apart overnight. It crumbles a little here, a little there... it takes decades before it's an utter mess. And because the process is so slow people don't realize that it's happening or are powerless to stop it (because there's no single event to fight against).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the only reason people get so upset of Alex is because there's so few outlets covering the truth... so if he doesn't give them the type of show they are looking for they get mad at him.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we should be mad at is that 99% of the media is nothing but propaganda.

       Having a shread (.5%-.6%) of truth in lots of what you say  doesn't make everything else you say truth or fact and people should not rely solely on any one source before making a decision about any topic.  talking to his sheeple is no different than trying to talk science with southern Baptists, its fucking SCARY that people eat up his shit like scat munching zombies.

       I apply the 90/10 rule to him. Good disinfo has to be 90% true to not just be ignored. He seeds bullshit into every story he talks about, so I tend to ignore him for the most part. But I think he probably does break a legitimate story once in a while.
