    <div class="md"><p>Yes. He goes overboard with the &quot;They&#39;re trying to make you a woman&quot; stuff but he is doing serious journalism. He broke Benghazi months before Seymour Hersh published pretty much the same story. He exposed Bohemian Grove once and for all. He was doing interviews with Russ Tice and William Binney back in 2004.

<p>I agree that he could be in the Knights of Malta or could even take money from Mossad (his wife is Israeli and he will never mention a peep about Mossad while he will rant and rave about the CIA). But it is clearly not pure bullshit. Only recently, he was the first one to say Benghazi was a CIA gun running plot. He broke that story before it was confirmed by Seymour Hersh and the Washington Post.</p>

<p>Does he act like a nutball and is he annoying a lot of the time? Yes. Is he pure bullshit? Hell no. He was the first one film satanic rituals at Bohemian Grove. He proved it when it was all just a crazy conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Great site. Thanks for showing it. But it only goes back to April 2, 2014. I can&#39;t find any archives. Do they focus just on NSA spying or are they privy to the Alien Disclosure in 2004: <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/ufo/key_to_et_messages.pdf">http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/ufo/key_to_et_messages.pdf</a></p>

<p>That doc is directly hosted by NSA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think bill cooper had a better idea of how the alien agenda plays  into the hierarchial   structure of what the source of   power is  but Alex Jones is clearly   an   ideologue. He  wants to sell  you something every chance   he  gets but doesn&#39;t report on science conspiracies  or alien conspiracies that would challenge his revenue stream.</p>

<p>I only like watching his show when people other than him are hosting it. He is  really rambunctious and fails to even  let his guests speak some times to interject the  same thing he spent  the last  half hour talking about..</p>

<p>Infowars  is a better news  source than  the msm  but not by  a large  margin that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>The problem with being a doomsayer is that the world doesn&#39;t fall apart overnight. It crumbles a little here, a little there... it takes decades before it&#39;s an utter mess. And because the process is so slow people don&#39;t realize that it&#39;s happening or are powerless to stop it (because there&#39;s no single event to fight against). </p>

<p>Anyway, the only reason people get so upset of Alex is because there&#39;s so few outlets covering the truth... so if he doesn&#39;t give them the type of show they are looking for they get mad at him. </p>

<p>What we should be mad at is that 99% of the media is nothing but propaganda.  </p>

<p>Alex Jones: Father Knows Best, Updated for the Apocalypse<br/>
The times have created this man, this nexus of patriotism and fear. Depending on who you talk to, he is a plague on or a tonic to our discourse, and we should all be horrified or grateful.</p>

<p>By John H. Richardson on August 20, 2013</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those who are making up their minds before even listening to what he has to say, why not listen to what he has to say, for at least a few minutes<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I apply the 90/10 rule to him. Good disinfo has to be 90% true to not just be ignored. He seeds bullshit into every story he talks about, so I tend to ignore him for the most part. But I think he probably does break a legitimate story once in a while.</p>

<p>All it took was the video of him harassing a young woman at a gun rally for me to see his true colours.</p>
