    <div class="md"><p>According to an article I read, the government made $50 BILLION on student loans last year.  That was more profit than many huge companies.  I think it probably has more to do with them, and the universities, wanting exponentially more money.  Same as with everything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO, well, not really.</p>

<p>Universities through their pricey tuition rates make sure that students will not be rocking the boat in any way. You can rest assured that students with say 75,000 in student loans are going to be too busy trying to work for a few decades to pay off the damn things.</p>

<p>I imagine that piece of society will be quiet for quite a while.  It will be nose-down, pretty conservative lifestyles until they are middle aged. And the radicalism of youth is therefore subverted.</p>

<p>The generations of the 60s-70s caused a lot of turmoil and ruckus, took a while, but those voices are long forgotten now. Universities are far more right wing and conservative than they have ever been.</p>

<p>Hell, they even have professors on part time and worried about their jobs, do you think they are going to make many waves?</p>

<p>The military and wars on the other hand are to vacuum up the poor, the dispossessed and the radical youths that remain. Not much good has ever come from a large group of disenfranchised young men with nothing to do. The Arab Spring is just full of them...</p>

<p>The Western military offers one of the few hopes for a better life for the poor and they are processed and spat out in a few years with either traumatic psychological effects of battle, grievous wounds or a small pension after their vigour is spent.</p>

<p>Now, it is again my theory, when the masses of the discontented get to a certain size they are culled by a major war. Just draft all those poor and jobless, give them a rifle and off they go to fight on some forsaken battlefield. Wrap it up in a Patriotic Duty and all is good for those who would control others...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently talked to an ex army official who claimed that the reason why they try to recruit new high school grads is because kids at that age believe they are invincible. They actually think they can run up a hill and not get gunned down. </p>

<p>Counter that with a more mature college grad who knows that the reality is that they are going to killed in a situation like that as well as the fact most college grads know that there is more to the situation than patriotism and I don&#39;t think many college grads are going to sign up for duty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think on the surface the rise in college rates are more to do simple supply and demand, and then a few other social factors. </p>

<p>Since we&#39;ve had a few breaks in the economy in the last decade.... Anyone remember 2001 .com bubble bursting? That drove a bunch of people into going back to school or staying in school. Then the same dynamic happened again with the housing bubble. Personally I was in school and had my credits for an undergrad in Business. Since there were no jobs I stayed another year and finished my second undergrad in PolySci/Law. </p>

<p>Now the market place is flooded with over educated and under experienced people, so everyone comming behind them has to go through to the masters level to even get an interview. </p>

<p>On top of that, there are more births every year. More kids graduating highschool and what opportunities do they have? Go to school.... </p>

<p>Now, local governements are/were feeling the financial pinch and reduced their aid to the public schools. So public schoos now have to raise tuition to cover and raise tuition to hire those few extra professors to teach those extra classes that those extra highschool grads are wanting to register for. </p>

<p>What the Fed Govmt. can control is the interest rate. I&#39;m currently paying 4.5% on my student loans. I know some others who are paying upwards of 6%. That is money in the bank, so to speak, for the FED. That is revenue and I would not put it past anyone in the government to want to keep or raise rates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Student loan rates have been on a constant rise since the 80&#39;s. If the government wanted more recruits, a better method would have probably been letting illegals in the country a second chance via joining the military instead of deportation/ getting arrested, in order to get citizenship. </p>

<p>While I don&#39;t trust them for a lot of things anymore, I&#39;d much rather have lower interest rates with government loans then with third parties. If you think the government makes a killing look at what Sally Mae and them charge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a bad angle to work. I think it&#39;s bigger than that. I think they had more than enough bodies to feed their war machine after 9/11. That was their plan, rally the people to a false cause. Student loans are more about keeping people in chains, financially. See, when you are worried about finances, like utilities, rent, mortgage, car payments, medical bills, student loans, etc, you don&#39;t pay attention to politics, you let apathy cut out the things you feel don&#39;t effect you. You can&#39;t go to protests or you&#39;ll lose your job, or worse, end up on a watch list. There are no proper channels to fix this broken system. They will keep us under pressure because they know we can&#39;t stand against them when we are busy propping up the facade of this world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they were. Just like the GI Bill is more for the college than the veteran. You know the school gets paid before the student and if anything goes wrong with the paper work, the student has to suffer. All the while the school feels zero pressure from the entire ordeal. This leads to the student taking a loan out and furthering the debt bubble waiting to explode. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>.....I think its just schools taking advantage of the credentialist society we have come and of the people thinking its a good idea to pay $300,000 for a liberal arts degree....</p>

<p>Meanwhile I&#39;ll be graduating soon with my ME degree and no more than $50,000 in debt. I chose an affordable school in a more off the beaten path location (state engineering school in South Dakota) instead of going to like, Washington University in St Louis....</p>
