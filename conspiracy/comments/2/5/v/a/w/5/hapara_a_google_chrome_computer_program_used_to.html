<p>He just told me, that he can login and turn on his student&#39;s camera and watch what they are doing...at any time. (He doesn&#39;t invade their privacy.)</p>

<p>He was given no warnings about what he should and shouldn&#39;t do with the software. </p>

<p>Every student in his high school has been issued a Google Chrome computer paid for by taxpayers. </p>

<p>Furthermore, he told me they pay a private company to monitor student&#39;s social media accounts and report back illegal acts and drug use. </p>

<p>He said, &#39;Just about everyday a student is arrested for one reason or another.&#39;</p>

<p>The computer is a stripped down model which they have to use for classes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What?  You&#39;re absolutely right to expect privacy in this situation  Why?  <em>It&#39;s illegal</em> for them to watch you, who has no idea, in your own home.  Even to just remotely view the PC.   The <em>only</em> way it would be legal is if they informed everyone that it could be used in that way and they agreed to it. (And even then I&#39;m not sure what they could do with the information.)</p>

<p>I work in IT at a school and we can remotely view / turn on whatever but this ability ends the moment it leaves the campus network.  I own a Chromebook and through Googles API I&#39;m sure this is all possible.  The thing is when you give people, especially instructors, the ability to do these things there should be very thorough policies in place, training sessions, etc... to prevent, and or legally watch-your-own-ass as a school, any malicious use by the instructors.</p>

<p>To just throw this into the wild and hope nothing goes wrong is absolutely unprofessional and idiotic.  It entirely the fault of the institution and is in no way the fault of Google.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The school districts around the country are funded by their local property taxes, paid by property owners. </p>

<p>Those in the community pay for the school, the teachers, and their supplies. </p>

<p>From my point of view, their parent&#39;s paid for the computers, not the &#39;school&#39;, or any other inanimate non-existent being. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So who actually owns that computer? Because it&#39;s definitely not the parents and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not the students either. The parents may have paid for it, but the school owns it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it like this. </p>

<p>When someone says &#39;Facebook bought Oculus.&#39; </p>

<p>Facebook is a company right. &#39;Facebook&#39; doesn&#39;t own anything, it didn&#39;t buy Oculus, the bondholders and shareholders own it, they bought it, the property, the patents, etc., etc. Not &#39;Facebook&#39;. </p>

<p>Just like Facebook, the &#39;School&#39;, doesn&#39;t own anything, its stakeholders do, the community who funds the school and who send their children there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I see what you mean and I agree that the school is essentially comprised of it&#39;s community and funders. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m interpreting you correctly, it follows that the device belongs to the community as a whole, not to the individual it&#39;s loaned out to. </p>

<p>I still think that you should have no real expectation (what you <em>want</em> is another matter) of privacy on someone else&#39;s device. The user is not the owner, therefore it should be assumed (if the user even thinks about this kind of thing) that your actions are monitored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, we should never assume anything we are using is private. </p>

<p>I think it is a different matter when kids are given computers they have to use and bring home for homework, which can be monitored. These are part of the curriculum, they are the new textbooks, with a mic and camera. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we can trust every teacher out there to do what is right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with this system if the computers never left the school. Unfortunately they do.</p>

<p>If the computers stayed in school the teachers could only monitor in class, to make sure the student&#39;s are completing their work. This does have a benefit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That argument can be extended to out of school as well, since students often do a large portion of work out of school. But I think we more or less agree that the rampant and unregulated monitoring by potentially irresponsible people is a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what the classroom is for, so the teachers can monitor the student&#39;s progress. </p>

<p>Not at home. Nothing, absolutely nothing, the student does at home has anything to do with the teacher. </p>

<p>Student&#39;s have been arrested at this particular school because they are only &#39;suspected&#39; of being high, missing school, or even cursing in front of an officer. </p>

<p>School is a criminalized zone. Every student in my friend&#39;s class has a felony. Why are we putting disadvantaged kids in a hole at the start of their adult life? </p>

<p>Our time of youth is to make our own mistakes, so we can personally learn from them and grow. This current schooling system is punishing kids for being kids. That is a problem, no matter which way you look at it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You <em>should</em> have an expectation of some privacy, but the concept is foreign in an authoritarian nation. In my opinion we trade freedoms for security not because of safety, but mostly because it translates into profit for certain large incs. . . &#39;war on terror&#39; &#39;patriot act&#39; i&#39;m no muslim but it seems like a veiled group of figures managed to support these acts <em>before conception</em></p>

<p>Students in 95% of countries with PC/Internet would never face data collection, anywhere besides China, Singapore, GB, ISR, USA, maybe AUS and certain western Euro nations. None of these countries have Gestapo though, so we&#39;re not yet to fascism it&#39;s easy ignore, but it&#39;s still a slippery slope. Singapore is very authoritarian, they may even have an unofficial Gestapo. Imagine if computing technology, personal computers or phones had been invented much earlier and Hitler or Stalin had access to NSA-style metadata! What if <em>there are now</em> individuals with access to the NSA?</p>
