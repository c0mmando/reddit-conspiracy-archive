       I've been an advocate for Sandy Hook truth since the evidence started pouring out in the aftermath, but there's been one part that has bothered me, but I think I may have an answer now...
      </p>
      <p>
       What bothered me was: Why hasn't anyone recognized the actor "parents" or the children from their "past" lives?  If I went on national TV tomorrow under a different name, my phone would start blowing up within 2 minutes.  People would be calling my family.  It would get out of hand
       <em>
        fast
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I saw two headlines, one was about kidnappings in Nigeria, and the other was about MH370, and it finally hit me.  They're not ordering these Crisis Agents from a web site, they're
       <em>
        raising
       </em>
       these agents.  As the face of the NWO, these have to be highly trained agents who must be willing to slip into a character, and stay in that character for the rest of their lives.  You can't find people like that on Craigslist.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're awkward on camera, they seem emotionally "not there," and they fit the profile of people who were raised in a government program.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one recognizes these people from their past because
       <em>
        they don't have one.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?

       That requires even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       assumptions.  The official story of Sandy Hook is just one assumption after another.  It's a known truth at this point that the "parents" of the "victims" were crisis agents.

       You were talking sense in the first few sentences of your post. If they were actors, it would get out of hand and blow up fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, you have invented a story involving the New World order about dozens of families being raised from childhood as actors. That still doesn't explain what happened to the children. Surely if they invented dozens of children, someone at this elementary school would ask the question…"who are these kids that were never registered here?"

       Seems like quite a stretch.  So, they kidnap these people and force them to breed?  Also, why wouldn't they train them how to act during their training?  Seems like that would be one of the big things for a crises actor.

       At first, maybe, but really let it sink in and think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where else are you going to find actors who
       <em>
        cannot
       </em>
       be recognized, even if you put them on huge televised events?  And where else are you going to find actors who will be willing to leave their whole life behind (friends, family, maybe even children) and start a new life with a new identity as a Newtown "parent"?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for their acting skills, that makes total sense.  If they weren't raised in a traditional family, then their emotional intelligence is going to be lower than a normal person.

       Well, even if you start with the assumption that there are crises actors, it would seem that plastic surgery would be far easier.  As for getting people to do it, people willingly go into the CIA as undercover agents and the like.  I'm sure you'd find willing people to get plastic surgery to do it.

       Seems too risky.  Plastic surgery isn't for complex overhauls, unless you're going for the catwoman look.  If you look similar, sound the same, and have the same mannerisms, people are going to come looking for you.

       Look at South Korean plastic surgery - there are some freaky good surgeons these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, for the right price (and other factors such as blackmail), i think a lot of people would accept a job as an actor who's role plays out for the rest of their lives.  Under this theory they would also be assured that skepticism would be far and few; that the very nature of their act would defy skepticism.

       Insane.  This is exactly what I'm talking about.  Raised under mysterious circumstances, cagy, emotionless, eyes darting back and forth.  He probably knows a few of the Newtown "parents" from his upbringing.

       If you are being serious, you need to seek professional mental help. The thoughts that you have expressed are not normal. This is not an insult and getting help is not something to be ashamed of. I care about your well being. I am happy to help you find professionals and help you overcome any hurdles that may prevent you from getting care (financial/insurance, transportation, etc.) if you would like me to.

       It's called creativity and thinking outside the norm. How many people do you think said the same exact thing you just said to great authors, musicians, and artists through out the ages? Yes, this person is better of being medicated with drugs /s. If he/she isn't hurting anyone, than why should they need to "seek" professional help? Because you, an internet stranger says he/she "should", without knowing the person? Please, it's a creative thought, and very well could be true. There is crazier shit that has been thought about in human that has come out to be true. Think about that for a second.

       Seems too risky.  Plastic surgery isn't for complex overhauls, unless you're going for the catwoman look.  If you look similar, sound the same, and have the same mannerisms, people are going to come looking for you.
