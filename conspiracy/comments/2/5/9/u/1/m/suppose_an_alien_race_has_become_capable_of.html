       The only reason they would be malevolent against us would be if we possess some kind of treath to them or other alien races in the universe.

       Besides, only peaceful alien civilizations would be capable of developing interstellar travel.

       human technological development made huge strides in both world wars. take aircraft for an example. the great war started with little to no use of aircraft in the conflict, and ended with recon, bombing and dogfighting being the norm above a battlefield. the second world war started with piston-engined propeller planes, and six years later ended with jet aircraft. the same kind of development trends happened in transport, medicine, industry, science and nearly any field you could name.

       my point is winning a fight motivates people to develop revolutionary technology.

       Only if the fight is justifiable. In reality, no amount of human deaths is required or justified for scientific advancement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientific dogma we have today has inhibited the masses from seeing the real problem of financial interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the current financial system wasn't rigged to make the rich richer and the poor poorer, there would've been many more opportunities for the funding of truly free scientific research.

       Because interstellar travel is quite another matter than crossing the Atlantic ocean in wooden ships, it would require all the developed nations of the planet to share resources and technology to even get close to reaching the edge of our galaxy, this is not something that can happen as long as our species is at war with itself.

       More advanced than us could also mean more civilized, which would not be hard when we are still operating usury and healthcare/war for profit. Exterminating thousands or millions of lives for no good reason is quite insane when you stop to think about it.

       Depends on their motivations.  If earth or humans possess something they need, it wouldn't end well for us.  They would just take it.  The conquistadors did this to the natives quite easily with swords.
      </p>
      <p>
       If their civilization has no dire needs and still makes first contact, then hopefully an exchange of knowledge.  But if we didn't have star travel yet, this would be like the US gov going on deep jungle expeditions to find primitives to share stealth technology with.  It wouldn't be worth their time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno.  I would like to believe a Type III Civilization or greater is benevolent.  Maybe earth is just a planet sized zoo where UFOs are just galactic tour busses.

       It's difficult to say, but usually the case when two civilisations encounter each other, and one is radically less advanced, it generally goes
       <strong>
        badly

       for the less technologically advanced one.

       If they are that advanced to reach us, then chances are they could blow us to shreds in a matter of seconds.  They are probably millions/billions/trillions of years more advanced and don't see us as any threat whatsoever.  If for some reason we had to fight, we would be absolutely screwed.  I personally think most advanced civilization don't base their actions based off emotions like our power hungry leaders, and we would be completely fine.  Just a thought.

       If you look at how just about every species on this planet interacts with other species, they are either food, threat or of no interest. The more advanced/intelligent including us, higher primates, dolphins, wales, dogs can recognize sentience in other species and share some kind of understanding but this seems to work best when there is no resource competition. Note the way the animal population on earth has been shaped by humans. Assuming the aliens do not need our resources since they can get them from anywhere we might be lucky and viewed as a curiosity. Otherwise food.

       There's a 50/50 split between extra-terrestrial entities interacting with this planet who are in service to others and those who are in service to self (aka benevolent or malevolent).

       The ones who built the pyramids were benevolent.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2.4 Questioner: Yes. You mentioned that the pyramids were an outgrowth of this. Could you expand a little bit on— Were you responsible for the building of the pyramid, and what was the purpose of the pyramid?
       </p>
       <p>
        Ra: I am Ra. The larger pyramids were built by our ability using the forces of One. The stones are alive. It has not been so understood by the mind/body/spirit distortions of your culture. The purposes of the pyramids were two: Firstly, to have a properly oriented place of initiation for those who wished to become purified or initiated channels for the Law of One.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two, we wished then to carefully guide the initiates in developing a healing of the people whom they sought to aid and the planet itself. Pyramid after pyramid charged by the crystal and initiate were designed to balance the incoming energy of the One Creation with the many and multiple distortions of the planetary mind/body/spirit. In this effort we were able to continue work that brothers within the Confederation had effected through building of other crystal-bearing structures and thus complete a ring, if you will, of these about the Earth’s, as this instrument would have us vibrate it, surface.

       The ones who built the statues on easter island and the nazca lines were malevolent.

        Ra: I am Ra. The technique used was of two kinds: one, the thought transfer or what you may call “telepathy”; two, the arrangement of certain stones in order to suggest strong influences of power, this being those of statues and of rock formations in your Pacific areas, as you now call them, and to an extent in your Central American regions, as you now understand them.

       So what else does the Law of One say about the Orion group? Does Ra claim that they are the malevolent Greys, reptilians, humanoids, or some other species?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am at session 34 and so far Ra has claimed that they have influenced world religions to limit our thinking/suppress the human spirit, that they are behind the global central banking system, that they have been responsible for the assassinations/deaths of JFK, MLK, Jesus, and several others, and that their civilization was the subconscious inspiration for the Empire in the Star Wars mythology. Is that right?

       The orion group is not of our density / dimension. As such they do not have physical access to our planet (there is a quarantine on our planet).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, they do have psychological influence on those who are susceptible. (Ie those who experience men-in-black phenomenon, abduction phenomenon, and so forth).
      </p>
      <p>
       The total extent of their influence is unknown. This is the key question in the entire Law of One material...

       This answer essentially proves the hidden hand interview is real. Luciferians are 6th density social-memory-complex here to catalize humanity.

       According to the Drake equation, life is abundant. Intelligent or not, its there.
To determine if a race of xenos was hostile to other Intelligent life on other 
celestial bodies, you we need to look at how they treat there fellow bretheron.
Along with the state of their home planet. If its war torn and has a class system
(like ants), you should probably not attempt to communicate with them. As they
may be "soulless" and have the ideology "for the greater good". How ever if they are 
benevolent, you should still be skeptical. The reason for this being, the Intelligence
they possess could be used to deceive us with an efficiency un-matched by anything/anyone on our speck of mud we call Earth. Think of the show V (this is a VERY REAL concept). The antagonist gave gifts to man kind, to humans the antognist WAS a literal God. The antagonist however had am esoteric agenda involving the gifting of tech. that would benifit mankind but would be the downfall in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that being said, WE SHOULD NOT attempt to communicate with ANY alien species until we sort shit out with ours, becuase our problems can be used to the advantage of a race of xenos wishing to eradicate Humans.

       I think that most would be benevolent as an entire planet (or multiple planets) combining resources and efforts would be vastly more efficient at obtaining interstellar travel. Which would only happen without constant wars. Also wars involving such technology could spell the destruction of entire planets (maybe?).
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the flip side, imagine that same civilization has run its course and now relies on outside resources it needs to self sustain. It may just "take" them from other civilizations/planets that have what it needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the second is far less likely as if you can travel through space to meet other forms of intelligent life, you probably have your own civilization pretty well looked after.

       Depends on their motivations.  If earth or humans possess something they need, it wouldn't end well for us.  They would just take it.  The conquistadors did this to the natives quite easily with swords.
      </p>
      <p>
       If their civilization has no dire needs and still makes first contact, then hopefully an exchange of knowledge.  But if we didn't have star travel yet, this would be like the US gov going on deep jungle expeditions to find primitives to share stealth technology with.  It wouldn't be worth their time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno.  I would like to believe a Type III Civilization or greater is benevolent.  Maybe earth is just a planet sized zoo where UFOs are just galactic tour busses.
