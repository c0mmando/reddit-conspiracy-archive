Also, that we are able to transmit from when astral projecting or remote viewing. Though, like any transceiver it can become dusty due to either lack of use, or external tampering, and may therefore require a cleaning in order to restore functionality. Perhaps a tuning as well to the correct frequency. Thoughts?</p>

<p>If you already know everything and you don&#39;t think there is anything else out there than why are you on here? </p>

<p>Does it make you feel good to shoot off your little pissy mouth on other people to try and give them your spoon-fed ideology.</p>

<p>I mean anyone can sit there and read what the fucking authorities give them and listen to all the nice &quot;science&quot; teachers at school. Literally we could have all done that and what would that prove? That we can fucking listen to somebody else who we believe is smart tell us something that they heard from their professor or read from someone who they think knows best.</p>

<p>David Icke was right about 1 thing, people just listen to others who they believe are smart and fucking adopt their beliefs because they are too stupid to think for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal belief is that such feats of enlightenment is achievable through proper diet and practice of proper meditation. The third eye has no place in making profit as i read below. Its simply about having your body in the peak of its health. The ability to use the pineal gland is the ability to be completly human. Right now i see everyone being so physically and emotionally disconnected from one another and its hard to watch. I believe if this esoteric belief were believed by a wider spectrum of populace the world would ressonate in harmony the way it should. Think for yourself, question authority and learn to love.</p>

<p>Changing the definition of something doesn&#39;t change whether or not it&#39;s real. If remote viewing is proven to be true, I don&#39;t care if it becomes &quot;natural&quot;, only if it&#39;s actually real. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try keeping a dream journal for a couple months and come tell me lucid dreaming is bunk.</p>

<p>Lucid dreaming is just being aware you&#39;re sleeping, there&#39;s no real world special implications in that. Lucid dreaming doesn&#39;t allow you to gain knowledge or see hidden things like remote viewing claims. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>What does the placebo effect have to do with supernatural stuff? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are alive therefore you receive the life energy. So much of the pineal gland info is cult indoctrination into the new age religion.</p>

<p>If you really research into this stuff you find that those that are into the stuff eventually get into purposely opening themselves up to possession. They use fancy words and names, but basically it is deceiving demons. You find this in the depths of Kabballaism and Hinduism. They literally want to be possessed. For some selfish super powers.</p>

<p>Some will just say God and demons aren&#39;t real. But this is what those who do this stuff believe.</p>
