       One that our souls are able to connect to from the higher realms in order to link with the physical body. Also, that we are able to transmit from when astral projecting or remote viewing. Though, like any transceiver it can become dusty due to either lack of use, or external tampering, and may therefore require a cleaning in order to restore functionality. Perhaps a tuning as well to the correct frequency. Thoughts?

       It's so funny how people come on here and just mouth off.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you already know everything and you don't think there is anything else out there than why are you on here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it make you feel good to shoot off your little pissy mouth on other people to try and give them your spoon-fed ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean anyone can sit there and read what the fucking authorities give them and listen to all the nice "science" teachers at school. Literally we could have all done that and what would that prove? That we can fucking listen to somebody else who we believe is smart tell us something that they heard from their professor or read from someone who they think knows best.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Icke was right about 1 thing, people just listen to others who they believe are smart and fucking adopt their beliefs because they are too stupid to think for themselves.

       My personal belief is that such feats of enlightenment is achievable through proper diet and practice of proper meditation. The third eye has no place in making profit as i read below. Its simply about having your body in the peak of its health. The ability to use the pineal gland is the ability to be completly human. Right now i see everyone being so physically and emotionally disconnected from one another and its hard to watch. I believe if this esoteric belief were believed by a wider spectrum of populace the world would ressonate in harmony the way it should. Think for yourself, question authority and learn to love.

       Read DMT: The Spirit Molecule. Better yet, acquire some DMT and vape/ingest. You'll be "talking to higher dimensional beings" before you realize it has always been Wankershim.

       Neuroscientists haven't even come close to figuring it all out. They are still totally clueless as to what 'consciousness' itself really is. Many believe it is just an illusion, but this does not explain NDEs or OBEs where (10s of thousands of) people claim to have been able to hover above their physical bodies.

       You can't prove the supernatural exists because as soon as you do, the supernatural becomes natural.

       Try keeping a dream journal for a couple months and come tell me lucid dreaming is bunk.

       The placebo effect works on the majority of humans. So really, the majority appears to have unlocked at least some of their inner ju-ju. I suspect those that have locked ju-ju probably subscribe to too much materialist woo-woo.

       Changing the definition of something doesn't change whether or not it's real. If remote viewing is proven to be true, I don't care if it becomes "natural", only if it's actually real.

       Lucid dreaming is just being aware you're sleeping, there's no real world special implications in that. Lucid dreaming doesn't allow you to gain knowledge or see hidden things like remote viewing claims.

       You are alive therefore you receive the life energy. So much of the pineal gland info is cult indoctrination into the new age religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really research into this stuff you find that those that are into the stuff eventually get into purposely opening themselves up to possession. They use fancy words and names, but basically it is deceiving demons. You find this in the depths of Kabballaism and Hinduism. They literally want to be possessed. For some selfish super powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some will just say God and demons aren't real. But this is what those who do this stuff believe.

       Well that is basically in there writings. Not really about the pineal gland, but it comes in the same group of teachings....There are thousands of accounts of possession. But I wasn't there. I just know what the people who write the stuff think...Supposedly even deep meditation opens you up.

       There are millions of accounts of possession.  I was just wondering what you thought was very credible for my edification.  I also don't wanna go through tons of writing to see my answers because I don't find it at all believable.  Thanks for the reply

       Ya I'm not sure what I believe myself. I've just been researching the Kabbala and Hinduism a lot lately. The desire to be possessed in them is very concerning.

       In Hinduism the female is supposed to allow herself to be possessed by a female spirit and male by a male spirit, then they have sex to allow the "spirits" to have sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       And some of the Kabballa spin offs they actually talk about controlling demon spirits. And talk about some being helpful and stuff. and possessions.

       Kali is the female spirit that posseses women in Hinduism. If you try googling without the name you just get a bunch of possession porn.

       Don't want to piss anyone off but this pineal gland crap gives me the feeling it's another major donation scam just like planet Nibiru with all the separate dates of which for example were 2012 and 2013. I don't believe all this crap honestly..
