    <div class="md"><p>After Tesla&#39;s death <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla">the FBI was contacted by the War Department (now know as the less ominous Department of Defense)</a>, his papers were declared to be top secret. If you read up on Patent Law, you may find some interesting information: The U.S. Patent Office has a nine-member committee that screens patents in order to protect &quot;national security&quot;. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/181">U.S. Code › Title 35 › Part II › Chapter 17 › § 181
35 U.S. Code § 181 - Secrecy of certain inventions and withholding of patent</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whenever publication/disclosure by the publication of an application or by the grant of a patent on an invention in which the Govt has a property interest might, in the opinion of the head of the interested Govt agency, be detrimental to the national security, the Commissioner of Patents upon being so notified shall order that the invention be kept secret and shall withhold the publication of the application or the grant of a patent therefor under the conditions set forth hereinafter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Tesla&#39;s claim about free energy and anti-gravity are true, the consequences to the world economy and world powers would change the world overnight.</p>

<p><em>These concepts have been proven in hundreds of laboratories all over the world, yet never see the light of day. If the new energy technologies were set free world wide the change would be profound. It would affect everybody, it would be applicable everywhere. These technologies are absolutely the most important thing that have happened in the history of the world.</em>   – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_O&#x27;Leary">Dr. Brian O’Leary</a>, Former NASA Astronaut and Princeton Physics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My flying machine will have neither wings nor propellers. You might see it on the ground and you would never guess that it was a flying machine. Yet it will be able to move at will through the air in any direction with perfect safety, at higher speeds than have yet been reached, regardless of weather and oblivious of &quot;holes in the air&quot; or downward currents. It will ascend in such currents if desired. It can remain absolutely stationary in the air, even in a wind, for great length of time. Its lifting power will not depend upon any such delicate devices as the bird has to employ, but upon positive mechanical action.&quot; - Nikola Tesla in New York Herald Tribune, Oct. 15, 1911</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you had a flying machine powered by an infinite energy source, it would render international borders useless. No more &quot;no-fly&quot; lists, TSA, groping... basicaly all forms of government control of the masses would collapse. Some of the companies that would take a hit:</p>

<ul>
<li>J P Morgan (banking, energy, railroads, US Steel)</li>
<li>Edison &amp; General Electric (oil &amp; energy, railroads, aviation, war industrials, banking)</li>
<li>Rockefellers (oil, banking, Nazi connections through IG Farben)</li>
<li>Rothschilds (banking, oil &amp; natural resources, connections to Kuhn Loeb &amp; company through Jacob Schiff )</li>
<li>Ford motors (motors, war industrials)</li>
<li>Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co (banking, ship yards, railroads, IG Farben)</li>
<li>Du Ponts (chemicals &amp; war industrials, General Motors, IG Farben)</li>
<li>Vanderbilts (railroads, ship yards)</li>
<li>Boeing Company (aviation)</li>
<li>Lockheed (aviation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Oil &amp; energy, steel and other natural resources, railroads, ship yards, aviation, car industry, spare parts, logistics, banking &amp; finance, military industrial complex are some of the reasons to steal and keep this technology hidden.</p>

<p>But as the saying goes, follow the money.</p>

<p><strong>1870:</strong> John D. Rockefeller Founds Standard Oil</p>

<p>Rockefeller founds Standard Oil of Ohio with $1 million in capital, the largest corporation in the country. The new company controls 10% of U.S. petroleum refining.</p>

<p><strong>September 1873</strong>: Stock Exchange Crashes and Standard Oil Takes Advantage of Economic Downturn</p>

<p>On September 18, the stock market crashed, followed by a six year depression. During this time, Standard Oil absorbs refineries in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York, and Pennsylvania&#39;s Oil Region.</p>

<p><strong>1877:</strong> Rockefeller controls almost 90% of the oil refined in the United States</p>

<p><strong>1882:</strong> Standard Oil Trust is Formed</p>

<p><strong>1890:</strong> Congress Passes Sherman Antitrust Act</p>

<p><strong>1902:</strong> Nikola Tesla Begins Exploring How to Transmit Electricity Without Power Lines; JP Morgan Refuses Further Funding
Nikola Tesla’s Wardenclyffe Tower, initially financed by J.P. Morgan, was designed to transmit electricity without wires. By 1904, J.P. Morgan - who had a monopoly on copper which was used to transmit electricity – refused to provide any more funding.</p>

<p><strong>1908:</strong> The U.S. Government Targets Standard Oil in Antitrust Suit</p>

<p><strong>1911:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court Orders Standard Oil to Dissolve. Shootoffs Include ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, and ConocoPhillips.</p>

<p>Standard Oil is split up into 34 different companies. The Rockefellers still hold stock in these oil companies.</p>

<p><strong>1913:</strong> Rockefeller Foundation is Founded. John D. Rockefeller gives the Foundation $100 million in First Year.</p>

<p><strong>1919:</strong> American Petroleum Institute (API) is Established</p>

<p><strong>1982:</strong> Inventors Adam Trombly and Joseph Kahn receive an <a href="http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/WO1982002126">international patent</a> for a zero-point energy device</p>

<p>They called it the &quot;Closed Path Homopolar Machine&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>1983:</strong> Trombly was issued a gag order by the U.S. government to stop development of the &quot;Closed Path Homopolar Machine&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Mid 1980&#39;s:</strong> Trombly developed another zero-point energy device with David Farnsworth
This device was called the “Piezo Ringing Resonance Generator.”</p>

<p><strong>January, 1989:</strong> Former Oil Businessman, George H. W. Bush, Becomes President</p>

<p>Before becoming President of the United States, Bush made a fortune in the oil industry. He founded Zapata Oil Corporation and ran the offshore drilling company for years.</p>

<p><strong>June 1989:</strong> Trombly’s Free Energy Demonstrations in New York and Washington D.C. Suppressed
Inventor Adam Trombly was scheduled to demonstrate a small version of his Piezo Ringing Resonance Generator at the UN in New York.  At the last minute Trombly was forced to do his demonstration at a church down the street.  Afterwards Trombly gave a speech in Dag Hammarskjöld Auditorium at the United Nations in front of an international audience. A few days later, Trombly was scheduled to demonstrate the same device at the US Senate Banking and Finance Committee in Washington. Only Senator Carl Levin and a &quot;handful&quot; of staff were in attendance because the Senior Bush Administration called hundreds of Senators, Congressional Representatives and their staff members for an &quot;off-the-cuff&quot; discussion of the Clean Air Act at the exact same time as Trombly’s demonstration.  The oil administration successfully diverted attention away from the technology in an effort to censor Trombly. Subsequently his lab was raided by the FBI, millions of dollars of equipment was taken and he was threatened and required &quot;for reasons of national security&quot; to cease his research.</p>

<p><strong>2006</strong> – A brief summary of the &quot;History of &#39;New Energy&#39;&quot; Invention Suppression Cases</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.rense.com/general72/oinvent.htm">http://www.rense.com/general72/oinvent.htm</a></p>

<p>An elite group of people and the corporations they run, have gained control over not just our energy, food supply, education and health care, but over virtually every aspect of our lives. And they do it by controlling the world of finance, not by creating more value, but by actually controlling the source of money. When you follow the money, it will take you to up the levels of a pyramid. We are at the bottom level, going about our daily lives. Above us is government, people who are given a monopoly on force and use it to tax and control us, whether or not we agree. But who controlls them? At the next level are the corporations. Many would say that it is now corporations (a &quot;corporatocracy&quot;) and not nation states, that rule the world. To acquire the world&#39;s resources and control the markets, this corporatocracy must to have access to cheap money. The big corporations get their loans with special rates from big banks, which means that those who control the major banks, the money elite, ultimately control the corporations which in turn control goverments and finally the people.</p>

This is why people don&#39;t take the subjects seriously on this sub. You can&#39;t just interchange completely different terms and expect people to think you&#39;re making sense.</p>

<p>That phrase doesn&#39;t make any sense. You replace free energy with &quot;solar and alternative&quot; and it makes sense. But the fact that people don&#39;t understand it&#39;s different is sad. I also don&#39;t see people here saying solar or alternative energy is bad, maybe you could point some out to me.</p>

<p>I think we all knew what he meant. </p>

<p>Also, compared to fossil fuels, solar and wind (and nuclear, though I personally see the massive risk potential as an infinite cost potential that should be acknowledged as such) are comparably very, very free.  In fact, the term free energy shouldn&#39;t even exist by your logic... in theory, &quot;free energy devices&quot; would capture energy from the quantum field and are thus not essentially &quot;free&quot;, the same way you argue solar is not free.  </p>

<p>Your argument, when scrutinized, is that &quot;free&quot; energy when taken absolutely literally is a misnomer.  And I think EVERYONE would agree with you there...no need to point out the obvious.</p>

<p>The plan HAD been to use hydrinos as a deliverable fuel source, and thus keep some mechanism in place for energy needs. Redundant now.</p>

<p>Saudis pumped a lot of money into perpetuating our FF dependence.. They probably are the main entity to blame for global warming in doing so.  Free energy could have been introduced 20 years ago (Mayer Mallove).</p>

<p>QEG is progressing nicely</p>

<p>I&#39;ll believe that if I ever see a working prototype in front of me.</p>

<p>As an electrical engineer, reading over the <a href="http://hopegirl2012.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/qeg-user-manual-3-25-14.pdf">manual</a> it struck me like just another <em>under-unity</em> device like the ones Mythbusters tested in their 2004 season.</p>

<p>Now I could be wrong, but I&#39;d rather focus legitimate suppressed/neglected technology that works on well known physical principals, such as small electric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subterrene">subterrenes</a> for making deep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_electricity">geothermal wells</a>.</p>

<p>Geothermal is starting to finally gain hold in the power industry, but drilling has been the biggest impediment to making it practical. Of course subterrenes solve that problem, as they melt instead of drill. I plan to construct a small tungsten-nichrome electric prototype some time.</p>

<p>Someone posted the WHO report about antibiotic resistance on the rise in the Reddit Science page. People were saying it&#39;s the fault of people who take too many antibiotics. </p>

<p>I posted that it&#39;s really from our food, the meat industry feeding 80 percent of ALL antibiotics to animals. This moderator of the science reddit kept posting that what I was saying was untrue, even though I posted like 5 different articles and sources including an MD assistant commissioner of the FDA and a meta study of the research that had 3 pages of sources for my exact point. He kept posting no sources just his disagreement. And he gets to delete my posts!!!</p>

<p>MIND YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS</p>

<p>Don&#39;t vote based on your faith, don&#39;t make laws based on your faith, don&#39;t fuck another person&#39;s life up for something that doesn&#39;t effect you.  Do you believe in the bible implicitly?  Great.  Are you an atheist?  Great.  Keep it to yourself.</p>

<p>And this is nothing against religious people, in fact i think atheists have taken over the most annoying group of people ranking lately</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This fact. If Obama was not born in the US (Hawaii) as he maintains, his two term Presidency is Constitutionally VOID.</p>

<p>In my 7 years on reddit, the one issue that people have tried to shout me down on most is...Barack Obama&#39;s laughably bogus PDF birth certificate, and the inevitable inference from this blatant fraud that he is not a natural born citizen (and therefore ineligible for the White House). </p>

<p>This issue invariably brings out an army of incredubots with arguments like &quot;there&#39;s nothing you can do about it&quot; which may be true, but doesn&#39;t exactly count as a rebuttal.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a post I made recently about the nationality legislation in force in 1961, and I pretty much guarantee it contains information you haven&#39;t come across before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree there&#39;s a huge amount of deliberate disinfo put out there to make the truth even harder to get to.</p>

<p>What we can be clear about is the legislation that was in force when Barack Obama was born in 1961, which has not been part of the public discussion at all! When you read it, it becomes clear that Ann Dunham (Obama&#39;s mother) was not eligible to pass her citizenship onto her son, because she was too young. </p>

<p>This is why a US birthplace is so important, and why it&#39;s so alarming that the White House website birth certificate is a PDF created with software and not a scan of a real document.</p>

<p>It&#39;s trying to, honestly the dude is just a troll with too much time on his hands, (&amp; I think I know who <a href="/u/I_Know_Who_Did_It">/u/I_Know_Who_Did_It</a>&#39;s alt is) I remember they had to temp ban totes_meta_bot a month or two ago because of a very similar scenario, I no longer care if they have to perma ban the bot, but they&#39;d probably just advise ignoring it for now.</p>

<p>It does annoy me for some reason, it shouldn&#39;t, the guy is clearly obsessed &amp; probably needs help.</p>
