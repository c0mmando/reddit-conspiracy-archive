    <div class="md"><p>I like the hypothesis from the fascinating film, <a href="http://vimeo.com/32828241#">The Revelation of the Pyramids</a>.</p>

<p>The pyramids, the Sphynx, and many other ancient monuments (which are all much older than the current consensus allows) were left as immovable &quot;sources of wisdom&quot; for future generations of humanity. The structure of the Great Pyramid shows incredible knowledge of mathematics, and of the dimensions of the Earth itself.</p>

<p>If you like the first film, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw9lTB0hTNU">Carl Munck</a> has much more detail as to how some of the great ancient monuments are linked, and how they &quot;reference each other.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and also like graham hancock&#39;s opinion that the egyptians believes they were creating a physical representation of the sky.  They believed it already was mimicked between the milky way and the nile, so they built structures that represented certain stars, certain star events, etc.  Read his sphinx book, it&#39;s really good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct.  But a lack of evidence should send you exploring other theories, which many have done.  So few still cling to the theory - and it is only a theory - that the pyramids are tombs.  There is no evidence supporting those claims.  No historical record.  And from that point, you&#39;d ask no further questions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that the King&#39;s Chamber might have been a sort of isolation chamber for transcendent experiences. The electrical nature of the pyramids I believe is just a by-product of attempting to harness and coordinate the Earths resonant frequencies (Shumann resonances, or the &#39;ley lines&#39;)</p>

<p>Like it or not, the pyramid shape resonates energy towards the apex.</p>

<p>The kings chamber is perfect in porportion and it encodes harmonics of 432hz.</p>

<p>The kings chamber is not a tomb, but a spiritual growth center. Perhaps a hallucinogen was ingested and the room was used as a test chamber for how to transcend the death journey (like written out in the Book of the Dead).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah. OK, I didn&#39;t know that. I&#39;ll research more on that. So, OK, if this is true, then why haven&#39;t we been able to reproduce this?</p>

<p>And OK, little pyramids, that makese logical sense (just in terms of &quot;big pyramid sends power to little pyramid&quot;) BUT—if we <em>assume</em> (yes, it&#39;s an assumption) the purpose of this project is for the energy to do <em>work</em>, like we use energy for, then where are the machines? Just having a glowing little pyramid in each house (fun to look at? Household lighting? Seems a stretch) doesn&#39;t cut it.</p>

<p>I personally wonder if the pyramid emitted a vibrational energy that changed consciousness. But again, that&#39;s just me musing and having fun. I prefer what can be scientifically reproduced...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be dissuaded by the naysayers ITT. They haven&#39;t done their research.</p>

<p>If you <em>truly</em> are interested in this subject, I couldn&#39;t possibly recommend this book enough:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Giza-Power-Plant-Technologies/dp/1879181509/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1399650216&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=christopher+dunn">The Giza Power Plant: Technologies of Ancient Egypt</a></p>

<p>The author, Christopher Dunn, is an extremely well-qualified engineer (not some crackpot). </p>

<p>This book and his theory are beginning to be taken <em>very</em> seriously by those in the know.</p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t think his book is the final say on the matter either.</p>

<p>I think power production capabilities may have been only <em>one</em> of the many lucrative uses for the Giza complex.</p>

<p>Once you brave Dunn&#39;s research, I recommend his second book as well, but for the next step in Giza speculation you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Giza-Death-Star-Joseph-Farrell/dp/0932813380/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1399650381&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=giza+death+star">should tackle this one, the first in a trilogy.</a></p>

<p>The military application of such a technology is undeniable. It makes you wonder why Napoleon, of all things, took control of the Giza complex very early on.</p>

<p>After all, pyramid literally means a fire within.</p>

<p>There is something beautifully mysterious, but terrifyingly destructive, in the history of those pyramids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Graham Hancock has also done some excellent research in this area as well.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m sick and tired of hearing people say they were simply tombs for dead pharaohs. The evidence does not support this theory:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scottcreighton.co.uk/PDF-Files/Ten%20Facts%20that%20Contradict%20the%20Pyramid%20Tomb%20Theory.pdf">http://www.scottcreighton.co.uk/PDF-Files/Ten%20Facts%20that%20Contradict%20the%20Pyramid%20Tomb%20Theory.pdf</a></p>

<p>Pyramid = a fire within... Ooh, I did not know that :O</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m thinking they were either power plants, healing chambers, or communication devices. All I know is they weren&#39;t tombs for pharaohs and they were not built by humans using any type of known technology.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a story of Sir William Siemens who climbed to the top with some companions. He noticed there was a strong electrostatic effect being generated at the top and was able to incidentally demonstrate a few &#39;shocking&#39; things with a makeshift Leyden bottle (early capacitor).</p>

<p>The Egyptian capstones would have been made of granite or basalt at the time. They were likely replaced with gold later and probably looted.</p>

<p>Ra: I am Ra. The larger pyramids were built by our ability using the forces of One. The stones are alive. It has not been so understood by the mind/body/spirit distortions of your culture. The purposes of the pyramids were two:</p>

<p>Firstly, to have a properly oriented place of initiation for those who wished to become purified or initiated channels for the Law of One.</p>

<p>Two, we wished then to carefully guide the initiates in developing a healing of the people whom they sought to aid and the planet itself. Pyramid after pyramid charged by the crystal and initiate were designed to balance the incoming energy of the One Creation with the many and multiple distortions of the planetary mind/body/spirit. In this effort we were able to continue work that brothers within the Confederation had effected through building of other crystal-bearing structures and thus complete a ring, if you will, of these about the Earth’s, as this instrument would have us vibrate it, surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re unerstanding the point the video is making. It states that erosion of the sphinx indicates it was flooded or under water and the only way this is possible is if it was 12,000 years old or more because of the ice age. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right in the idea that the video is generalizing the scenario by saying &quot;The last time there was water in the egypt area was over 12,0000 years ago&quot; when there has been streams etc. </p>

<p>Limestone is very sensitive to rain because the rain water reacts with the air&#39;s carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid. </p>

<p>Furthermore the limestone the head is made out of is less dense than the body. </p>

<p>This 12,000 year theory doesn&#39;t hold up, especially when taking into account all of the other evidence that points to an age of about 4,500 years.</p>

<p>The fact that the pyramids are surrounded by graves suggests that there is a strong connection between the pyramids and death. They very well could have been a tomb or something associated with the afterlife.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both churches are decorated, and contain similar artifacts. Decoration may change but the layout would at least indicate some similarity of function. Sarcophagi are found in the valley, no such articles in the pyramids. </p>

<p>We have evidence of a great deal of disruption in the succession of rulers and in the fortunes of Egypt from the early period of pyramid building to the later period as represented by the Valley of Kings. What did not change (significantly) were religious practises. The valley tombs cover a lengthy period of time and we don&#39;t see much diference between the contents of the oldest versus the newest tombs. That indicates consistancy in religious practises on the same scale that we see in modern religion where funerary rites have remained essentially unchanged for some 2000 years. </p>

<p>That the pyramids were tombs was the first supposition of those archeologists who first studied them. Once the idea became widespread it became orthodoxy. None of the pyramids have yielded human remains or even funerary artifacts. The first assumption was a good one, but it has nothing to back it up.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a veiled insult. You have no idea how I&#39;ve come to question the dogma. You also don&#39;t seem to have enough background information to offer criticism. Modern egyptologists admit uncertainty about the nature of the pyramids just as they now question the origins and meaning of the Sphinx. The interiors of the pyramids and the confirmed tombs are so different that common purpose is questionable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are both not auditoriums? Do they both not feature crosses? There are diferences between churches, synagogues and temples based on their being different religions. The religion in Eqypt did not change significantly from the early to the late periods. The early period was a time when Egypt was at it&#39;s height in terms of culture, influence and wealth. Yet we do not see any indication of that inside the pyramids. </p>

<p>We see a great deal of continuity in temple design from the early to late period. We can attribute that to the continuity of religious practises and symbolism. The same continuity can be seen in temple design across cultures where the religion has not changed. The change from your first link to the second represents a jump in religious practise. However, both still share some similarities. A shot of the front of the hall in the second photo would reveal many of the same objects as are found in the first - a podium, an alter, and crucifix. Would we then conclude that the rooms are designed for the same purpose? Likely we would. </p>

<p>There is nothing at all similar between a stone mauseleum and a hole in the ground other than both contain coffins. That fact yields the conclusion that both are funerary arrangements. There are simply no similar articles or even design between the interiors of the pyramids and those of the valley tombs.</p>

<p>No they aren&#39;t. As I said earlier the Khufu pyramid contains only a rough hewn container that is, by itself, too small to contain a sarcophagas. Walls are not painted and the few symbols that are found carved into the walls don&#39;t resemble religious symbols. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So? Why isn&#39;t that enough? Why do you expect more? Based on what? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are you even bothering to object to what I said?</p>

<p>Go ahead and find a church without a cross or alter. I can quarantee that the church in question is not the same religion as that of your first link. Religion in Egypt did not change significantly from the early to late periods. A catholic church built today would contain most of the same artifacts as St. Paul&#39;s which indicates a continuity of religios practise. Such continuity is what defines a religion in the first place.</p>

<p>Stuff like that sparked my curiosity.  The geometry of the pyramids is incredible.  Mathematics and real investigative science makes a strong case for the pyramids to have been purpose-built for a real technological venture.</p>

<p>They idea that their alignment and the level of their architecture...  To believe that a civilization would be so organized, so advanced, so calculated... and they would only demonstrate that as an unmarked tomb?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read your own link?  The writer doesn&#39;t &quot;debunk&quot; a single thing.  Most of it is him stating blatantly biased opinions and just outright insulting the person he&#39;s writing about.  He spends no more than 2-3 sentences on any of the books he references.  How can you &quot;debunk&quot; an entire book in 3 sentences?</p>

<p>And if you want &quot;factually incorrect&quot;, let&#39;s start here: &quot;In this tome, he starts off by being amazed by the fact that there exist maps of the world showing bits that hadn&#39;t been discovered yet at the time they were drawn. This is a pretty selective approach, since early maps frequently show areas of land that were not actually there, due to mistakes or misidentification.&quot;</p>

<p>He conveniently leaves out the part where the maps referenced in the book show areas of land that actually <em>were</em> there to a very high degree of accuracy.  So really that entire two sentence &quot;debunking&quot; doesn&#39;t apply at all and is thus completely meaningless.</p>

<p>You expose yourself and your agenda pretty clearly by linking to an article like that.  </p>

<p>So you say. That doesn&#39;t make it so.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how you structure an argument:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You make a claim. </p></li>
<li><p>You offer evidence. </p></li>
<li><p>You show how the evidence proves the claim.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You are currently at step 1. </p>

<p>Have you even read the book by the way or do you just take two sentences on a wiki page as gospel and call it a day?  Look up the Piri Reis Map, for starters, and go from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the hell are you talking about?  The link you provided &quot;debunks&quot; the maps in <strong>Fingerprints of the Gods</strong> by <em>not citing anything even resembling evidence</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s <em>him</em> making a claim that the book is inaccurate, he (and you) are the ones who need to provide evidence to support that idea.  His snarky, two sentence comment doesn&#39;t count.</p>

<p>The evidence to support Graham Hancock&#39;s claim can be found <em>in the book</em> - you should read it.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could do some research on the Piri Reis Map, like I just told you to (how is that not me providing evidence again???) instead of just taking some asshole on rationalwiki&#39;s unsourced word for it.  Who wrote that article anyway?  Do you even know?</p>
