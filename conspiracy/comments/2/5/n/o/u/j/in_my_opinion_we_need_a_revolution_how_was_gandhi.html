    <div class="md"><p>We do indeed need a revolution.  Part of what made Gandhi so successful is that he was able to stare at the face of brute force with compassion, peace, and love (<a href="http://oi59.tinypic.com/2m3qzas.jpg">relevant</a>).</p>

<p>Another part of what made him successful, however, is that the revolution he helped usher took place in a land where the people there understood <em>muuuch</em> better than we do in the West that these bodies we have here are but the most temporary of physical vehicles being driven and commanded by an eternal identity that cannot be touched or harmed by whatever damage the limited physical vehicle of the body may experience.</p>

<p>As such, the people he walked with in the East were better able to move forward and march in the face of grave physical harm.  They knew that 1) what they were marching and demonstrating for was greater than the physical alone, and 2) they were not their physical bodies anyway, so there was not as much fear in them of any harm coming to the body itself.</p>

<p>Here in the West, we for the most part have been brainwashed into thinking that all we are is this measly, tiny, limited physical vehicle (go to <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> to get but a glimpse of this).  As a result, we spend an inordinate amount of time trying to keep that physical vehicle from harm.  Revolutions, therefore, are generally completely out of the question because revolutions just <em>might</em> risk damage to that tiny, limited, physical vehicle.</p>

<p>One&#39;s world view and understanding of reality, in other words, must expand out beyond the one which we have allowed ourselves to be brainwashed into believing is the case.</p>

<p>Whooboy, do I...</p>

<p>There&#39;s <a href="http://vivekanandaji.blogspot.com/">Swami Vivekananda&#39;s writings</a>, studies done by academics like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stevenson">Ian Stevenson</a> and his seminal work &quot;Twenty Cases Suggestive Of Reincarnation&quot;, almost <em>any</em> book by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_K%C3%BCbler-Ross">Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, M.D.</a>, books by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Monroe">Robert Monroe</a> and the voluminous amount of ongoing work done in his Monroe Institute...There really is a <em>ton</em> of stuff that exists.  I&#39;m just listing these few off the top of my head.</p>

<p>The worst part about it is that <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> doesn&#39;t actually realize that you actually CAN bash each and every religion (which would be a stupid thing to do - to think or suggest that everything about &quot;all&quot; of them is incorrect - but, for the sake of example, you could), and yet it does absolutely <em>nothing</em> to the idea of theism itself - as theism is not limited to any religion in the least.  Most atheists (not all, but most) seem to make the straw man fallacy mistake of propping up a false and extremely limited representation of what true theism is about (keeping it within the narrow bands of &quot;religion only&quot;) and then, in bashing that false representation, they then feel that they have successfully bashed <em>all</em> theism in general.  Nothing can be further from the actual truth, however, and there are countless examples of studies done showing examples of the continuance of personal identity independent of any physical vehicle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is some saying: &quot;As on the inside so it is on the outside&quot; or something to that effect.  Maybe the revolution people seek is much closer and more possible than we are lead to believe.  It lies not in changing government or power structures or labor or economic policy.  It is not about changing a monolithic system or changing other people.  The answer is elusive because it is as infinitely varied as the people who who will come up with it.  It is a revolution of consciousness, and the beauty of it is that everything &quot;they&quot; do will accelerate it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gandhi was an opportunist, he was so successful because the British Empire was in tatters and had neither the resources nor the strength to bring India back into the fold. Churchill wanted to and asked the U.S. and other power players of the time to help, but they wanted Britain divested of it&#39;s colonial holdings and told Churchill so. The Brits had to let it go. Gandhi was a horrible leader and when he achieved Independence for India he was murdered because he wanted to wipe out any western influence in the country and take it back to simpler times. He wanted to eradicate advanced medicine, technology, agriculture, etc... and go back to traditional methods. He was not that great of a man. Like MLK he was given the credit for the change that took place because the people who hold power know the only way to really make significant, sweeping changes is through violence and they don&#39;t want that. The 1% of India still holds sway as they did in the past, but work for different masters now.</p>
