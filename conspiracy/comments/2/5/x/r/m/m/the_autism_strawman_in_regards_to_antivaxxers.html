        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you have been on Reddit for a while, the anti-vaccers are &quot;stupid&quot; people because vaccines don&#39;t cause autism. A recent study shared on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> proved that. The venomous attacks throughout the responses toward anti-vaxxers always scares me for us as humans.</p>

<p>Anyway, I always find these conversations frustrating. They saw that autism isn&#39;t cause by vaccines, so they conclude that you should get vaccinated. But autism isn&#39;t the reason people don&#39;t vaccinate. I guess if autism was caused by vaccines, it would be a major reason. But most anit-vaxxers that I know are refusing to vaccinate for other reasons.</p>

<p>I just made this little piece to share.</p>

<p>I binged &quot;why should i not vaccinate my children&quot;.</p>

<p>Here is what I found.</p>

<p>First link (<a href="http://www.vaccineriskawareness.com/Why-I-Don-t-Vaccinate-My-Children">http://www.vaccineriskawareness.com/Why-I-Don-t-Vaccinate-My-Children</a>). She chose to not vaccinate because she didn&#39;t like the ingredients in vaccines. She didn&#39;t want to inject them in her children.</p>

<p>Second link (<a href="http://thepeopleschemist.com/reasons-dont-vaccinate-children-vaccine-supporters-shouldnt-give/">http://thepeopleschemist.com/reasons-dont-vaccinate-children-vaccine-supporters-shouldnt-give/</a>). Takes more of a natural immunity approach. If you keep your kid healthy, he won&#39;t get sick sort of deal. This is the one that I hear most often.</p>

<p>Third and Fourth were pro-vaccine from the CDC.</p>

<p>Fifth link (<a href="http://www.healingwell.com/library/health/thompson2.asp">http://www.healingwell.com/library/health/thompson2.asp</a>) argues that vaccines are ineffective at fighting the spread of diseases and that vaccinated children are, despite the teaching otherwise, more susceptible to the diseases they are vaccinated from.</p>

<p>Sixth link was a dead link.</p>

<p>Seventh link gives six reasons not to vaccinate. <a href="http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/six-reasons-to-say-no-to-vaccination/">http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/six-reasons-to-say-no-to-vaccination/</a> Autism is mentioned in passion in one of the reasons.</p>

<p>Eight link (<a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/dr-kurt-why-i-will-never-choose-to-vaccinate-my-own-son-and-any-future-kids-my-wife-and-i-have/">http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/dr-kurt-why-i-will-never-choose-to-vaccinate-my-own-son-and-any-future-kids-my-wife-and-i-have/</a>) argues for natural immunity building. &quot;A vaccine violates all laws of natural immune defenses by taking a potential pathogen along with all the TOXIC ingredients(aluminum, formaldehyde, adjuvants, etc) directly into your blood system. This process would never occur in building natural immunity. That last sentence is kind of an oxy-moron. Immunity is a natural thing. Vaccines are an artificial thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Next link is Yahoo answers, so I will stop here.</p>

<p>But I think it should be clear that the autism straw man is not here.</p>

<p>This is pure rhetoric bullshit, and the stats prove it.</p>

<p>Look it up, people who don&#39;t wash their hands are actually a grave threat to public health, FAR more so than people who refuse certain vaccinations, which the data shows actually doesn&#39;t increase public health risks.</p>

<p>I am not trying to argue for or against vaccination. I am just showing that pro-vaxxers arguing autism with anti-vaxxers is missing why anti-vaxxers are anti-vaxxers.</p>

<p>edited to add: Pro-vaxxers would do well to actually understand why anti-vaxxers are anti-vaxxers if they want to convince them. Just demonizing might work on certain people, but it probably won&#39;t work on a group of people who are already willing to step outside of the social norm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the research I&#39;ve participated in, majority of the sources of anti-vaccination rhetoric is;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>deeply held religious beliefs, and influence through church members</p></li>
<li><p>mis-understanding what constitutes scientific research versus conspiracy</p></li>
<li><p>media reports on vaccine side-effects being a substantial threat, which it really is not.</p></li>
<li><p>reading about individual ingredients and adjuvants, and assuming they&#39;re harmful (mercury, etc.) but in reality eating a can of tuna has more contaminants than a years worth of vaccines.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The real problem is education. There is a growing anti-scientific movement especially in heavily religious areas and communities. Just watch a debate on climate change.... It&#39;s unfortunate, but a reality at this point that people are not receiving adequate education in what herd immunity is, and how it benefits our society.</p>

<p>If you remove vaccines, you remove a substantial portion of our society, think 1900&#39;s Spanish flu, or bubonic plague. Our immune systems are AMAZING, but cannot adapt to the rate at which globalization has occurred.... To think otherwise is nothing but personal belief and mis-information.</p>

<p>Thanks to individuals like Dr. Andrew Wakefield and his compadres Jenny McCarthy et al. Their unscientific bias has spread, namely through the undereducated populations trying to justify any available cause for their health problems.... Why are we letting uneducated parents out their children and ours at risk for a personal belief? Do we really want measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and more coming back to kill our next generation!?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please keep in mind that the &quot;Spanish Flu Epidemic&quot; was not an &quot;epidemic&quot; at all--it was an iotragenic illness--meaning...deaths from this &quot;flu&quot; were almost all from ASPIRIN and the over-prescription of it as doctors knew that the &quot;safe doses&quot; were the ones that Bayer gave them.</p>

<p>We now see that those doses were 100s of times greater than needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was pandemic, with short durations of being an epidemic (two distinct arrivals in N.A)
Your assertions that it was an iotragenic illness is also unproven, and merely a hypothesis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Deaths from the flu were almost all from Aspirin&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that&#39;s a new one for me. I don&#39;t remember that in any of my pathophysiology or microbiology texts.... If that were the case, there should be some literature on that... And after a quick search, I found some interesting points to counter that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mortality was driven by 2 overlapping clinical-pathologic syndromes: an early, severe acute respiratory distress (ARDS)-like condition, which was estimated to have caused 10%-15% of deaths (sequential autopsy series are lacking) [3)]; and a subsequent, aggressive bacterial pneumonia “superinfection,” which was pres-ent in the majority of deaths</p>

<p>To determine the proportion of virus-induced pathology, subsequent bacterial infection, and overall 1918 pandemic mortality attributable to salicylate, experimental models and analysis of primary consecutive individual treatment and pathology records are needed. Prospectively, aspirin should be investigated in countries where aspirin is used for influenza.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indicating there is no direct correlation as of yet, it&#39;s still merely a hypothesis, one that may never truly be answered.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you trust a source with one person reporting their findings?</p>

<p>Or a source in which groups of professionals review, critique, add their findings, and generally challenge the authenticity?</p>

<p>Peer-reviewing is what makes science successful, a sharing and building of information from multiple professionals and studies.</p>

<p>Is there corruption? Absolutely. However it is usually caught, and reported on. As in cases like Dr. Andrew Wakefield trying to link autism to MMR vaccines. He was prosecuted, lost his license, and his work was retracted. Another win for science....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets pause here for a minute. Did you read your links? And do you agree with them? From the first link. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought the theory of &#39;immunisation&#39; was strange (how can one achieve wellness by injecting themselves with germs? - even as a young child with no interest or knowledge of medicine I knew instinctively that in order to be healthy you need a clean internal system and if you introduce bacteria and viruses into the body you will disrupt the vital force</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dangerous and stupid. You agree? Not to mention the straight up lies told in the first link, and the misinformation mostly geared towards shock value without explanation. Protip: If you have ever been near a car you have been introduced to more formaldehyde and chemicals that you have received from a vaccine, and they always fail to mention that you literally need formaldehyde to regulate your metabolism properly. </p>

<p>Second link used cherry picked information with the same emphasis on toxins in vaccines. Claims that vaccine actually increased disease levels and proper hygiene is responsible for the eradication of polio... </p>

<p>I would love to see some sources from the 3rd link... But they actually do bring up interesting points about how early to immunize a kid, and about how and why other countries banned certain vaccines. Ill give them that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even more powerful, ask Moms with several children, some of whom are vaccinated and some who are not.    In my own circle, the Moms I know who have one or two older kids who are fully vaccinated and the younger kids who did not get any shots tell me that, hands down, that the unvaccinated children are healthier and have less problems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anecdotal</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conversely, you can never undo a vaccination.   There are holistic therapies that can detox a child from the vaccine’s poison, but the damage that is done can never be 100% repaired.    And, I have NEVER met a fully vaccinated child that is healthier and more robust than a well nourished, unvaccinated child.   Period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anecdotal</p>

<p>The last link makes the least amount of sense. Lets assume that a certain percentage of people have an adverse reaction to vaccines (which could very well be, I dont argue that) the fucker in the last piece is try to say &quot;Polio, you know you really only have like a 2-5% chance of anything really bad happening. THEN WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU AGAINST VACCINES!</p>

<p>I was only sharing that &quot;autism is why anti-vaxxers don&#39;t vaccinate&quot; is a rather stupid assumption that pro-vaxxers make. Just a simple internet search would show that isn&#39;t the reason. I did the search for them.</p>

<p>Yet another autism/vaccine article will make its rounds. Pro-vaxxers will mock anti-vaxxers. </p>
