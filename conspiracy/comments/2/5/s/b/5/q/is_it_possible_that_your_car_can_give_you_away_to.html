        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Im not sure if my title makes alot of sense. Also im not much of a conspiracy theorist and im not a stoner. This is just what always comes to mind.</p>

<p>So i work in a distribution center for a grocery store and noticed how everything(including workers) all fall down under some kind of barcode. And just like every item, we have social security numbers which are connected to everything we do. Our insurance numbers, license numbers, phone numbers and adresses are all connected to our individual identities. And with phones now having gps and camera its imposible to not be tracked. </p>

<p>So that got me thinking about cars. How the car can detect if you&#39;re not wearing seatbelts, how fast you&#39;re going, and all of that good stuff. So your car is connected to your identity. Basically through the DMV which has your personal information. </p>

<p>So if your car has internet is it possible that a cop can just search your plate number on their computer and through a giant filter say what you&#39;re doing wrong,  if you&#39;re a fugitive, or have anything due? </p>

<p>Im not sure if i need concrete evidence on this sub, i was just wondering that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You won&#39;t get ticketed for speeding that has been tracked &quot;remotely&quot; by a police officer over the internet.  A cop needs to observe the crime in order to pull you over.  If he was able to see your license plate was tracked going 85 in a 65 that still isn&#39;t evidence that you did anything wrong.  Somebody could have borrowed your car or there could have been a glitch in the tracking system.  These sorts of things would hold no water in court cause there is no actual physical proof <em>you</em> did anything.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah some states have that and it requires a photo of the driver.  If the picture is blurry or you can&#39;t tell who the person is those tickets are usually not even delivered and if they are and it is even a little iffy you can fight it in traffic court and it&#39;s thrown out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they appeared to have scrapped that idea anyway here.</p>

<p>Our major city installed some speed cameras around some schools/parks that are only active during hours when children would be out and about going to said schools or parks though. I have no problem with those cameras though as people should proceed with caution around kids. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am example would be your phone&#39;s internet usage is connected to you through the phone number. And you are connected to the license plate. So if the NSA had some sort of red flag on you to arrested you on phony charges due to suspicion, would it appear on a cops computer? (as far I know the NSA is a complete mystery and don&#39;t really know what they are about, purely hypothetical)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re about intel. They want to know if people are plotting anything before they go ahead and do it. That said, they really suck at it. Shit is still gonna&#39; happen, happens, whatever.
Unless you&#39;re a couple months away from doing something bad, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about it.
The problem with their data collection is it&#39;s all-encompassing. Privacy is out the door, all data collected with the hopes it&#39;ll get them a lead. It was about fighting terrorism. Now it&#39;s probably more about economic espionage, lulz, and wanking to pics of your neighbours&#39; wife.
That said, yeah, the cop can see your record if the run your plate. They can see if your insurance expired, outstanding tickets/warrants, all that shit. Does that tie into you liking gay BDSM and having recently looked at some on your ifone? Read something farfetched and reeking of horseshit on GLP? Naw. Some dude at the NSA might be getting a kick out of it, or maybe even thinking your bros &#39;cuz you have the same taste in porn, but the cop can&#39;t arrest you for it. Not yet anyways. And if anyone has had their arm twisted to do something they&#39;d rather not because of blackmail from someone at the NSA, we haven&#39;t heard about it. I&#39;d imagine they&#39;d have to be into something that&#39;ll get them into deep shit whether or not the internet itself was involved, like kiddy porn, terrorism, human trafficking, etc.
Like you said, purely hypothetical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea good point. At this point I&#39;m more in the &quot;I don&#39;t have anything to hide so it doesn&#39;t matter&quot; and freedom of speech isn&#39;t really all that real, plus privacy was on it&#39;s way out one way or another regardless.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, expecting any level of privacy with internet use is really silly. Your connection passes through so many hands. It&#39;s really just an illusion of anonymity. The only real difference now is that slides have leaked about active programs to monitor the net. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a new venture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I doubt any real,privacy has existed for quite a while on the internet. It first got my attention watching the movie Hackers.

    <div class="md"><p>Hydra was pretty neat. At this point really just a footnote, but it was a centre of data collection and encoding/decoding signals during WW2. 
Camp X was the spy school where it was housed.
When we read this NSA stuff, we&#39;re really seeing an evolution of something that&#39;s already been around for a lot longer than most people care to think. NSA was a response to Pearl Harbour, after all. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with it. It&#39;s when all the protections are gone and those along the chain can read your pillow talk, or other embaressing but inonculous stuff without warrant is when it gets weird. It seems Orwellian, and it isn&#39;t a far step to say it can be used to quell dissent (it could) or track you or your car, based on your internet browser history. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re that fucked up. I think we&#39;re just getting more tech, and thus lazier and more prone to live our lives out with tech, and this is a side effect.</p>
