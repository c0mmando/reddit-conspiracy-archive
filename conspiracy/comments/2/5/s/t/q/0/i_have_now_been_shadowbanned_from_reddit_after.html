        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: I may NOT be shadow-banned, it seems I was temporarily blocked from submitting links?</p>

<p>Discussion: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/25shpz/i_have_been_shadowbanned_from_rhighereducation/">http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/25shpz/i_have_been_shadowbanned_from_rhighereducation/</a></p>

<p>Honestly I have no idea what this is. If its not a shadow-ban, why are all my submissions marked as spam.</p>

<p>Anyway I will post an update if I figure out what&#39;s really going on. CHEERS.</p>

<hr/>

<p>A few days ago I was harassed by <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> mods after I asked them if I was allowed to submit a story I wrote on my personal blog:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/25kghx/ive_been_reported_to_reddit_admins_for_asking/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/25kghx/ive_been_reported_to_reddit_admins_for_asking/</a></p>

<p>Then, they &#39;reported&#39; me to Reddit admins. Why? Because my username matched the name of my blog, apparently. I never broke any Reddit guidelines on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and had never submitted content. They had to find some reason to hate me, though, so they finally said (after I posted on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) that over 10% of my submissions were from my personal blog, despite hundreds of comments and 3rd-party links I had shared, and despite me not even knowing how to check those statistics.</p>

<p>More proof that Reddit, more than any other &quot;corporate&quot; social network, has become a playground for sadistic, hypocritical, power-tripping, narcissistic moderators with nothing better to do than abuse the massive growth that Reddit has achieved in the past few years by censoring and harassing independent bloggers, or anyone apparently that doesn&#39;t pay off mods with enough cash to keep on with their corporate shilling. Ironically, this once-haven of free speech activists and programmers is now more authoritarian and backwards than social communities that answer to shareholders and a board of directors.</p>

This op though is grating on me especially since <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are upvoting his tantrums. </p>

<p>Everything is explained very well in his last post to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and you can see in his response to the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> mods multiple detailed explanations he just does not get that he has been violating reddit guidelines. </p>

<p>He himself in that thread stated that 10 percent self promotion is ok and the mod and others point out hes accumulated 25%.  Absolutely no admission of his fault , no humility whatsoever. </p>
