       how many of you have read the novel Dune by Frank Herbert, or seen the movie?
      </p>
      <p>
       i think i've read it 3 times &amp; sure i've seen the move more than a few times. what i wasn't aware of was the various info/hints in the story there are pertaining to the Illuminati, of course i didn't know this when i first read the book, but then i read Bloodlines of the Illuminati, i think it's interesting - may not make it true, i was looking all over for my copy of the book - can't find it, oh well,
      </p>
      <p>
       my favorite line was:
"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain ." Dune by Frank Herbert
      </p>
      <p>
       from Bloodlines of the Illuminati by Fritz Springmeier
      </p>
      <p>
       The Illuminati have hidden their rituals, mind-control scripts and plans under the disguise of fiction. There are a number of movies and books which also provide a description of the Illuminati. In trying to remember movies that reveal what the Illuminati is like, so their readers might have something that would quickly introduce them to what the Illuminati is like, two movies quickly pop into mind: Eyes Wide Shut, and Dune.  In these movies, the Illuminati , the masters of illusion and myth, welcome viewers to a view of themselves disguised as fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       An Ex-Illuminati years ago (’92), went page by page in the Dune novel and highlighted for Fritz Springmeier the passages which portray the Illuminati (called Imperium in the novel). The Dune Chronicles were made into a spectacular 4 hour motion picture which reveals how the Illuminati function, their secret breeding programs &amp; human broodmares, witchcraft, pomp &amp; ceremony, generational power transfers, long-term plans (&amp; as the says “plans within plans with plans within plans”-p.226), mind-control, love of hand signals, internal ceremonial gladiator duals, ritual blood drinking (disguised as a Freeman ritual) an backstabbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the movie (&amp; novel) you see the Illuminati’s various Bloodlines (the House of so and so) carry on their constant in-fighting for mastery of the worlds they control. The use of mystic schools as fronts (religious covers) is described on p.508.  You will see how they create and manipulate religious beliefs among the common masses, who are simply used as workers for the elite’s power &amp; wealth. You see how they use the spice &amp; drug trade (which they did indeed during the 15th through 19th centuries) as a basis of their civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mothers of Darkness and the Sisters of Light are transparently disguised as “Reverend Mothers” and “Sisters” of the Bene Gesserit (sounding Jesuit), The Guardians (fierce, cruel &amp; powerful near-suicidal warriors) in the actual Illuminati are named the “Sardaukar” in the Dune Chronicles. The book mentions “Imperial conditioning” which in real life is better known as Monarch Mind Control.(p-526) (For more information on such Mind Control see Fritz Springmeier’s three books on Illuminati mind-control) The one Mother says, “I exist only to serve.” One of the actual mind-control programs, the creation of programmed self-induced catalepsis (my note: catalepsy defined as a trancelike state) is mentioned in the book (p-514) and film. Another aspect of the mind-control are the double-binds seen in the boo where a Sister says to the Queen Mother “I love and hate you...”(p.11.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The  neccessity for the Illuminati’s mulitiple personalities is described on page 21. “The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure.”

       I never read Dune or watched the movie but
       <strong>
        Eyes Wide Shut
       </strong>
       is very "in your face" with Illuminati symbols, Kubrick knew what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       This documentary about Kubrick and the Illuminati is quite good:

       yes, i read that some of the "ILL" were upset he made the movie, i don't know why, because he
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       allowed to film at the Rockefeller mansion.
      </p>
      <p>
       also read the rumor that Kubrick was asked to make the film about the astronauts first moon landing and that he feared for his life after it was made? don't know if it's true or not.

       Wollaton Hall in Nottingham, was built by Francis Willoughby (1547–1596), although it's a little small to really use the term 'mansion', imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire was a very similar design, and
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       was was originally owned by a Rothschild, although only for a short time, as they died soon after its completion.

        the documentary on Alejandro Jodorowsky's unfinished film version

       . Jodo brought some of the mystic themes of the book even more to the forefront; unsurprising from a man whose
