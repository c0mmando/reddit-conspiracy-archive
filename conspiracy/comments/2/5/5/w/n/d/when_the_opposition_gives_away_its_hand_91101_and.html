        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/251flp/newtons_3rd_law_of_motion_is_kryptonite_to_911/">post</a> from yesterday morning. It&#39;s still being brigaded rather aggressively by the <em>debunkers</em>.
As of right now, 267 comments, +79up, -85down</p>

<p>The debunkers don&#39;t like Newton&#39;s 3rd law of motion. In fact, of 267 comments, only one person tried to debunk Newtonian physics as it pertains to 9.11.01, and it looked like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/251flp/newtons_3rd_law_of_motion_is_kryptonite_to_911/chcrkeq">this</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time for a new independent investigation into the events of 9.11.01. The debunkers, in their haste to make physics disappear from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, have given away their Achilles heal. </p>

<p>Happy Friday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a simple experiment for you. See if you can wrap your brain around it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.burtonsys.com/staticvdyn/">http://www.burtonsys.com/staticvdyn/</a></p>

<p>Its static vs dynamic loads. The piece of paper in this experiment was able to support 1372 grams of STATIC load. It was unable to offer any resistance at all to 12 grams of DYNAMIC load dropped from a height of 9 or 10 feet.</p>

<p>Translate that into what we saw at the trade center. Each single story in the building would be able to support a given amount of static load. You put that load in motion, and it overwhelms what that single story is capable of supporting.</p>

<p>Also, the trade center was comprised of 88% air. When the top portion of the building collapsed, it would be akin to dropping a 30 story building from 12 feet in the air onto the bottom part of the structure. When it impacted the first floor it made contact with, it would have overwhelmed it almost instantly. Now the dynamic load is 31 stories worth of weight, and it has another 12 feet of air to drop through before impacting the floor below. The amount of resistance each floor is able to offer is not nearly enough to stop the huge dynamic load coming down on it, and might merely slow it down by a fraction of a second. The load picks up that fraction of a second as it descends the next 12 feet to impact the floor below</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The force expended in collapsing the first individual floor of the trade center was equal to the amount of force expended in slowing the 15 stories of falling debris by a fraction of a second. There. 2 forces acting in equal and opposite directions. Your Newton&#39;s 3rd law argument is now bunk. The problem is that the falling debris pile has infinitely more energy than it takes to collapse a floor of building. The debris pile is slowed very slightly by the first floor it impacts, and then has 12 feet of air to fall through before it impacts the next floor. That now 16 stories worth of debris is moving faster than the 15 story pile was a moment earlier. So it possesses even more energy than it did when it started. The link I provided did the math. The initial 15 stories would have been moving at 19mph when it impacted the first floor it came in contact with. That floor would have slowed it by 0.6 mph (expending an equal amount of energy as it took to pulverize and collapse the floor, Newton&#39;s third law in action). That now 16 story debris pile drops another 12 feet through air, increasing in speed to 27mph by the time it contacts floor number 2. Floor number 2 provides even less resistance than floor #1 did, because the pile is heavier than when it started, and is moving faster. It takes the same amount of energy to destroy floor 2 as it did floor 1, but the energy exerted to slow the pile makes even less of a dent in speed, because the pile possesses far more energy than when it started</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a simple experiment for you. See if you can wrap your brain around it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.burtonsys.com/staticvdyn/">http://www.burtonsys.com/staticvdyn/</a></p>

<p>Its static vs dynamic loads. The piece of paper in this experiment was able to support 1372 grams of STATIC load. It was unable to offer any resistance at all to 12 grams of DYNAMIC load dropped from a height of 9 or 10 feet.</p>

<p>Translate that into what we saw at the trade center. Each single story in the building would be able to support a given amount of static load. You put that load in motion, and it overwhelms what that single story is capable of supporting.</p>

<p>Also, the trade center was comprised of 88% air. When the top portion of the building collapsed, it would be akin to dropping a 30 story building from 12 feet in the air onto the bottom part of the structure. When it impacted the first floor it made contact with, it would have overwhelmed it almost instantly. Now the dynamic load is 31 stories worth of weight, and it has another 12 feet of air to drop through before impacting the floor below. The amount of resistance each floor is able to offer is not nearly enough to stop the huge dynamic load coming down on it, and might merely slow it down by a fraction of a second. The load picks up that fraction of a second as it descends the next 12 feet to impact the floor below</p>

<p>From video evidence, significant portions of the cores of both buildings (roughly 60 stories of WTC 1 and 40 stories of WTC 2) are known to have stood 15 to 25 seconds after collapse initiation before they, too, began to collapse.

    <div class="md"><p>The force expended in collapsing the first individual floor of the trade center was equal to the amount of force expended in slowing the 15 stories of falling debris by a fraction of a second.</p>

<p>There. 2 forces acting in equal and opposite directions. Your Newton&#39;s 3rd law argument is now bunk.</p>

<p>The problem is that the falling debris pile has infinitely more energy than it takes to collapse a floor of building. The debris pile is slowed very slightly by the first floor it impacts, and then has 12 feet of air to fall through before it impacts the next floor. That now 16 stories worth of debris is moving faster than the 15 story pile was a moment earlier. So it possesses even more energy than it did when it started.</p>

<p>The link I provided did the math. The initial 15 stories would have been moving at 19mph when it impacted the first floor it came in contact with. That floor would have slowed it by 0.6 mph (expending an equal amount of energy as it took to pulverize and collapse the floor, Newton&#39;s third law in action). That now 16 story debris pile drops another 12 feet through air, increasing in speed to 27mph by the time it contacts floor number 2.</p>

<p>Floor number 2 provides even less resistance than floor #1 did, because the pile is heavier than when it started, and is moving faster. It takes the same amount of energy to destroy floor 2 as it did floor 1, but the energy exerted to slow the pile makes even less of a dent in speed, because the pile possesses far more energy than when it started</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to use the ultimate cop-out here first and say that I&#39;m not a physicist or an architect. The last time I studied physics was in high school and I wouldn&#39;t know where to start calculating the forces necessary to bring down the buildings...</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>When I was a child, I used to visit the World Trade Center often (my dad worked there). Like most people who grew up around New York City, I have a deep understanding of just how large these towers were. Here&#39;s a visual:  They were so big, I could see them from my town in New Jersey, about 40 miles away. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I was so confused on 9/11.</p>

<p>I remember that morning thinking (mostly about my dad, who luckily transferred offices a year or so before the attack, but still worked nearby), &quot;Holy shit they need to evacuate lower Manhattan, if the fire burns for too long, the tops of these towers could crumble around the impact sites and fall.&quot; By that I meant that I thought it might be impossible to get firehoses up that high, and the fire might burn for days, and eventually there might be a section of tower so weakened that the floors above that part might topple and fall sideways, onto neighboring buildings, leaving the impact sites as the tops of the towers.</p>

<p>If I hadn&#39;t seen it live on TV, I never would have guessed that what happened could happen. </p>

<p>What did happen is that the towers fell at near-free fall speed directly into their own footprints only an hour after being hit. One right after the other, each leaving no trace at the same free-fall speed. </p>

<p>Intuitively, it seems impossible that the weight of 25 stories of office building (above the plane strike) has enough energy to totally vaporize the remaining 70 stories below, even if the structure was weakened by fire. (The twin towers were designed to withstand hurricane winds, mild earthquakes, and yes, even airplane strikes).</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t know this, but to get to the roof deck (and my dad&#39;s office on the 90something floor) you had to take more than one elevator in more than one elevator shaft. The world trade center towers were each actually three skyscrapers built on top of one another. The places where the stacked &quot;towers&quot; met were called &quot;sky lobbies.&quot; They weren&#39;t used as office space, just empty floors where you could get from the &#39;down&#39; elevator shaft to the &#39;up&#39; elevator shaft. I&#39;m not sure if this is the real reason, but I&#39;m under the impression that when the towers were built, it was impossible to have a single elevator shaft that reached all the way up and down. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_lobby">The wikipedia article for &quot;Sky Lobby&quot; has a diagram of the WTC&#39;s as its example photo</a></p>

<p>The official 9/11 story says that the impacts of the planes dislodged the fireproofing on the support beams and jet fuel leaked down the elevator shafts, burning and eventually weakening the beams. Again, I want to impress upon you the size of these towers and the fact that they contained sky lobbies</p>

<p>There simply isn&#39;t enough jet fuel in a single plane (that had been flying for a couple hours before it struck) to do that. And even if there were, the structure of the towers makes it impossible that it could get below the highest Sky Lobby, meaning that the jet fuel from an impact on floor 80 could only drip down as far as the sky lobby around floor 70. </p>

<p>Also, wouldn&#39;t most of the jet fuel in a crashing airplane be burned away very quickly in the impact explosion?</p>

<p>If by some wild coincidence that didn&#39;t happen, and instead the jet fuel trickled down the elevator shafts (while also burning) and damaged the structural support beams of the towers, <em>and</em> the strike of the airplane hit the tower at <em>just</em> the right spot to ensure that the weight of the floors above was enough to crush the whole building, <strong>the collapse would only affect the top third of the tower.</strong></p>

<p>Instead, we saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNbQaI4JDAM">this</a>. Total vaporization in seconds. </p>

<p>Also remember: The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed only <strong>56 minutes</strong> after the impact of Flight 175. </p>

<p>For that unlikely series of events to happen twice in one day, once in less than an hour, flawlessly, beggars belief. </p>

<p>So, there are a lot of questions about 9/11. I&#39;ve read the 9/11 Commission report and I&#39;ve watched all the National Geographic Channel specials, but I didn&#39;t get a lot of answers about any of these questions. </p>

<p>Youtube can point out questions, but it can&#39;t really give us answers, so why didn&#39;t the government give us answers that make sense?</p>

<p>By far, the most suspicious thing about 9/11 is that it has become a social taboo to ask these questions. If it happened the way the government said it did, why are they afraid of these questions? Why haven&#39;t we made an effort to learn how it happened so new skyscrapers can be built without the same flaw?</p>

<p>This is what did me in. For a long time I was skeptical. 9/11 is the ultimate red pill. A &quot;gateway&quot; conspiracy like the JFK assassination, where the history doesn&#39;t match the video tape and the government&#39;s position doesn&#39;t match the facts. </p>

<pre><code>Put it this way, in the UK and all of Europe, universities that teach in the relevant subjects, architecture/engineering etc are told to completely ignore events that happened that day i.e. three steel framed buildings imploded due to fire because the official version is physically not possible, it goes against known and well understood fundamental laws of physics.

<p>Not once in your comment history have you provided proof for this, though you&#39;ve so far mentioned it at least ten times.</p>

<pre><code>Complete rubbish and you know it, even NIST says this can not be correct, it is not sound science my friend.
</code></pre>

<p>So you believe NIST even though your other comments say you don&#39;t? How odd.</p>

<pre><code>I have a masters in engineering from a UK uni, you are either not from any where in UK/Europe and/or are just being deliberately deceptive for what ever reason. It is common knowledge, in fact a well known inside joke is showing the collapse of WTC7 to demonstrate a well done controlled demolition.
</code></pre>

<p>Wherein you say you have a masters in engineering, but nothing about structural engineering.</p>

<pre><code>The bloke was dead before the year 2003, even main stream media in the UK printed this shit over 5 years ago[10] he was kept alive by the US propaganda machine as a bogeyman to justify the war on terror, anyone with a brain cell can see through this now.

<p>Sure. I was simply wondering <em>where</em> you got your information from. I&#39;m not currently disputing it.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea of the amount of force that would be required to push that mass sideways? A lot more than is required for the mass to just crush the floors below. </p>

<p>You are failing at applying your own third law. (and ignoring the 1st, and maybe 2nd).</p>
