       In general, do you keep your mouth shut in public and simply voice concerns on the internet?  Do you limit what you say and what topics you actually discuss, or do you start with dates from history and try to quickly piece together the whole picture in a 10 minute "speech" without taking a breath?
Or, do you wear your scepticism with pride as proof that you are an "out of the box" thinker?

       I don't mind being labeled a "conspiracy theorist". I know what it really means. Conspiracy Theorists do not immediately buy the first story that comes along. It's like this...You are shown a picture in which there is a lot going on. The person who shows you the picture tells you what the "story" behind it is. As you study the picture, perhaps for days, weeks and months, you discover many things that need to be talked about. And these new clues or evidence could mean something entirely different happened than what you were told....But, since you don't believe the official story as presented you are crazy conspiracy theorist for wanting to talk about your questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What pisses me off are the ignorant people who have fed into the ongoing propaganda that anyone who does not agree with an official story of any event is a conspiracy theorist. Words like Looney, crazy, fringe and extremist are also associated with it thanks to our completely owned and obedient media.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Conspiracy" and "conspiracy Theorist" have been redefined since 9/11. The terms are now used as a tool of shame in order to stifle discussions of truth.

       That's a good one. Burroughs was a character, literally, he was Old Bull Lee in On The Road and was into orgone. It reminded me of this quote, though I forget the source, "They say paranoia because there's no word for rational fear."

       I don't like that this label implies some sort if mental illness. The majority of conspiracy theorists on TV are suffering from some mental illness like schizophrenia or are shown off as losers living in their parents' business. I'm just someone who examines events at a different angle. Admittedly you wouldn't guess I'm one bc I publicly (outside the internet)  agree with the official story or just don't talk about my thoughts when questionable events are discussed.

       Yes, this is the worst part. Whenever I start explaining things to people, I invariable end up getting hot under the collar; both at the globalists and not so much at the people I am talking to, but at the fact that I can't undo their programming. Then they always make comments that I need to calm down or I am losing it. They don't get it. I'd like to see how the average person would react if you threatened to harm their mother or daughter; well that is what is happening to everyone's family, of course I'm going to get mad.

       you have loaded this question with a powerful presupposition. the idea that the label should piss me off is itself the problem. it does not piss me off. recognize that the pejorative version of the term was propagated by american intelligence during a period of extreme and obvious subterfuge and lawlessness at the highest levels of american government. i am proud of the label. the Nuremberg trials were a conspiracy trial, reese committee the curch committee all of these are part of a long tradition of conspiracy theory investigation and action. embrace it and educate people when you can sure but looking at it already pissed before the conversation begins stifles the possibility of explaining your position. stay calm and let reason and logic win over doubt. anger at the label makes one sound paranoid. engage others on the topic on their terms and appeal to their values instead of defending your own. this questions starts the inquisitive off on the defensive which is ironic isnt it?

       in that case, the irony is, i suppose, that this question was not meant for someone like you.

       Among my redneck family, and steadily drifting-away friends, thinking outside-of-the-box means crazy; unless doing so is demonstrably making you rich and/or famous. I don't discuss reality with them until it reaches them; because, until it does, they just don't want to know; and will actively resist knowing. It took a fair amount of drama to learn this; and I'm still being savaged by gossip because of it.

       The fact that people think it is a derogatory term. There are in fact many real conspiracies in this world. There's nothing wrong with being a conspiracy theorist. Being a conspiracy enthusiast, on the other hand, I think borders on mental illness and springs from immaturity/ignorance.

       In todays world it is a sign of madurity to not repeat the massmedia propaganda. Everywhere I go I find someone who thinks outside the box. And you only see how somebody reacts to some coded words by using them in a conversation. Then maybe we might switch from small talk to a political discussion. And those people I find always think for themselves and are very humble and open minded which makes them very nice people to be around.

       All the conspiratards have their own places where they can laugh all day and keep their stupid narrow minded theories that are debunked.

       I would not say that one group is better than the other, but let us be honest that their best approach is to use propaganda techniques. They never show up to a scientific discussion because they are

       I actually use the term to disarm people sometimes, before telling them my views. I've actually been chided before--but about qualifying my beliefs before I speak them, not speaking them. Now, on certain hot button topics talking to people who only watch Fox or MSNBC or whatever, I will get some angry responses ("X world leader is just evil, you don't understand evil, where do you read this stuff about oil pipelines? You just make this stuff up, don't you?"), but mostly because people are defensively pissed about not having the same info and think I'm attacking their knowledge.  I give 'em a few days, and they're not mad anymore, and they've armed themselves with more knowledge. They may not be in lockstep with me, but that's not really what my goal was, anyway.

       yeah, I will usually try to convince people to do their own research, not simply to believe what I am telling them... in a way that is where the problem stems from, people want to just be told what to think.
I usually tell them a few key terms to google or something regarding whatever we might be discussing, and leave it at that...
