    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mind being labeled a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. I know what it really means. Conspiracy Theorists do not immediately buy the first story that comes along. It&#39;s like this...You are shown a picture in which there is a lot going on. The person who shows you the picture tells you what the &quot;story&quot; behind it is. As you study the picture, perhaps for days, weeks and months, you discover many things that need to be talked about. And these new clues or evidence could mean something entirely different happened than what you were told....But, since you don&#39;t believe the official story as presented you are crazy conspiracy theorist for wanting to talk about your questions. </p>

<p>What pisses me off are the ignorant people who have fed into the ongoing propaganda that anyone who does not agree with an official story of any event is a conspiracy theorist. Words like Looney, crazy, fringe and extremist are also associated with it thanks to our completely owned and obedient media.   </p>

<p>&quot;Conspiracy&quot; and &quot;conspiracy Theorist&quot; have been redefined since 9/11. The terms are now used as a tool of shame in order to stifle discussions of truth.  </p>

The majority of conspiracy theorists on TV are suffering from some mental illness like schizophrenia or are shown off as losers living in their parents&#39; business.

Admittedly you wouldn&#39;t guess I&#39;m one bc I publicly (outside the internet)  agree with the official story or just don&#39;t talk about my thoughts when questionable events are discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is the worst part. Whenever I start explaining things to people, I invariable end up getting hot under the collar; both at the globalists and not so much at the people I am talking to, but at the fact that I can&#39;t undo their programming. Then they always make comments that I need to calm down or I am losing it. They don&#39;t get it. I&#39;d like to see how the average person would react if you threatened to harm their mother or daughter; well that is what is happening to everyone&#39;s family, of course I&#39;m going to get mad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you have loaded this question with a powerful presupposition. the idea that the label should piss me off is itself the problem. it does not piss me off. recognize that the pejorative version of the term was propagated by american intelligence during a period of extreme and obvious subterfuge and lawlessness at the highest levels of american government. i am proud of the label. the Nuremberg trials were a conspiracy trial, reese committee the curch committee all of these are part of a long tradition of conspiracy theory investigation and action. embrace it and educate people when you can sure but looking at it already pissed before the conversation begins stifles the possibility of explaining your position. stay calm and let reason and logic win over doubt. anger at the label makes one sound paranoid. engage others on the topic on their terms and appeal to their values instead of defending your own. this questions starts the inquisitive off on the defensive which is ironic isnt it?</p>

<p>maybe then i should have asked &quot;people who get pissed off at being labeled a <em>conspiracy theorist</em>, why?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In todays world it is a sign of madurity to not repeat the massmedia propaganda. Everywhere I go I find someone who thinks outside the box. And you only see how somebody reacts to some coded words by using them in a conversation. Then maybe we might switch from small talk to a political discussion. And those people I find always think for themselves and are very humble and open minded which makes them very nice people to be around.</p>

<p>All the conspiratards have their own places where they can laugh all day and keep their stupid narrow minded theories that are debunked. </p>

<p>I would not say that one group is better than the other, but let us be honest that their best approach is to use propaganda techniques. They never show up to a scientific discussion because they are <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/en/news-section/41-articles/881-dr-david-griscom-wins-911-physics-debate.html">loudmouthed cowards with no explanation for their theories</a>.

I&#39;ve actually been chided before--but about qualifying my beliefs before I speak them, not speaking them.
