       most ppl know that fluoride wasn't really put in the water for dental health, although that's the line we were told, which is why so many have  easily become dumbed down &amp; docile (i only include the link as proof of info about the use of fluoride), others have post about what this does to the pineal gland, more importantly is why it's been done,
      </p>
      <p>
       "Research chemist Charles Perkins was sent by the U.S. government to ascertain the truth on water fluoridation and found: “”The German chemists worked out a very ingenious and far-reaching plan of mass control that was submitted to and adopted by the German General Staff. This plan was to control the population of any given area through mass medication of drinking water supplies . . . In this scheme of mass control, ‘sodium fluoride’ occupied a prominent place. . . However, and I want to make this very definite, the real reason behind water fluoridation is not to benefit children’s teeth . . . The real purpose behind water fluoridation is to reduce the resistance of the masses to domination and control and loss of liberty . . . Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluorine will in time gradually reduce the individual’s power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narco-tizing this area of the brain tissue, and make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him . . . "

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       edit:
"The ‘dental caries prevention myth’ associated with fluoride, originated in the United States in 1939, when a scientist named Gerald J. Cox, employed by ALCOA, the largest producer of toxic fluoride waste and at the time being threatened by fluoride damage claims, fluoridated some lab rats, concluded that fluoride reduced cavities and claimed that it should be added to the nation’s water supplies. In 1947, Oscar R. Ewing, a long time ALCOA lawyer, was appointed head of the Federal Security Agency , a position that placed him in charge of the Public Health Service(PHS). Over the next three years, eighty-seven new American cities began fluoridating their water, including the control city in a water fluoridation study in Michigan, thus eliminating the most scientifically objective test of safety and benefit before it was ever completed.'

       To all the naysayers out there:
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of your stance on whether or not fluoride is toxic, it is essentially a forced medication upon the public via municipal water supplies.

       I ask you, can you name any other medication that is suitable to be delivered to both a 200 pound man and a 30 pound little girl in the same quantities without monitoring reactions or ever adjusting doses?

       Yep, vaccinations.  Same dose for everyone.  A two month old baby will receive the same dose as an adult.  Pretty interesting huh..... Even paracetamol has dosagage requirements! 
Fortunately my kids aren't vaccinated and we live in a non fluoridated community.

       I consider myself fortunate to be born in the late 70's. My parents where hippies and very into nature, organic food, etc. That being said, parents didn't really have a choice to wether vaccinate their children or not, it was just something that everyone did and followed their doctors orders.  With the development of the internet, we know have a wealth of knowledge and research at our fingertips.  We also need to remeber that doctors learn this same information in their first 2 years of medical school and yes we now have access to the same resources that they do. So why go see a doctor when we have the same knowledge? We see them for their judgment and recommendations based on the expertise and experience in their field.  Parents now have choices that my parents did have and honestly I'm so thankful that my parents DIDN'T have that choice. I can tell you without a doubt that my parents would have made the wrong choice when it comes to immunization.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In water, the 
compound readily dissociates to sodium ions and hexafluorosilicate ions and then to hydrogen 
gas, fluoride ions, and hydrated silica...  At the pH of drinking water (6.5-8.5) and at the 
concentration usually used for fluoridation (1 mg fluoride/L), the degree of hydrolysis is 
essentially 100%...
Exposure via 
drinking water is, however, expected to be minimal, since at concentrations used in water fluoridation and at the normal pH of drinking water, both compounds hydrolyze almost completely. At equilibrium, the 
hexafluorosilicate remaining in drinking water is estimated to be &lt;&lt;1 parts per trillion

       This is exactly how I feel on the subject. It's been shown thoroughly that adding flouride to water has a negligible effect on dental health and the precedent that governments have the authority to medicate an entire population is a terrifying one.

       Your link deals with sodium, even though you omitted that as well as the source.

       They are different compounds with different formulas. Using both ambiguously is misleading by omission, and not just "my opinion".

       <em>
        It is generally considered that calcium fluoride, being much less soluble and less bioavailable than other chemical fluoride forms tested, is much less toxic than the soluble forms of fluoride.

      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Overall, acute exposure to soluble fluoride can induce vomiting, diarrhoea, respiratory arrest, 
cardiac depression and gastric mucosal changes. The latter have been reported following 
exposure to 18 mg fluoride/kg bw administered as sodium fluoride. Haematological changes 
(reduced numbers of blood cellular constituents), reduced collagen synthesis, signs of 
trabecular bone mineralisation and increased bone matrix formation have been reported on 
short-term studies in animals exposed to sodium fluoride.

       <em>
        "The claim that fluoridation is one of 'nature's experiments' is not valid because the salts put into the water supply, sodium fluoride or silicofluorides, are industrial products never found in natural water or in organisms. They are, furthermore, notoriously toxic, sufficiently so to be used as rat poison or insecticide. Calcium fluoride, on the other hand, which is the form commonly found in natural waters, is not toxic enough for such uses."

       The U.S.
       <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/2013/439490/#B33">
        CDC
       </a>
       published that systemic blood-borne fluoride from swallowing does
       <strong>
        not affect dental caries. In fact, systemic fluoride plays the most major role in causing the current U.S. high incidence of tooth fluorosis in children that prompted the U.S Health and Human Services to request in 2011 that water added fluoride be lowered from ~1ppm to 0.7ppm. But this is not expected to eliminate the problem.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride in drinking water whether natural or unnatural
       <strong>
        has no functional purpose
       </strong>
       . In fact this statement was published in the textbook written by dentist Dr. George Heard who first proposed to the Public Health Service in 1950 the idea that natural fluoride in water might be of benefit for tooth decay.
       <strong>
        He apologized later for the extrapolation in a letter to the
        <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/2013/439490/#B44">
         U.S. Health and Human Services
        </a>
        after finding that children raised on water with fluoride developed crumbly teeth interiors.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In another animal study
       <strong>
        1ppm
       </strong>
       artificial fluoridated drinking water
       <strong>
        did not decrease incidence of spontaneous dental caries.
       </strong>
       Thus fluoride does not affect teeth caries by either a systemic mechanism after assimilation or by direct contact with teeth surfaces from either fluoridated saliva or from treated water in the tested animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not possible to reach an acute lethal blood level of industrial fluoride from treated water unless there were an accidental overfeed. 1ppm water leads typically to ~0.2ppm blood fluoride.
       <strong>
        But only ~1ppm blood levels cause a chronic form of congestive heart failure (found after hemodialysis with fluoridated water) and 2-3ppm causes acute heart failure.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Ingested sodium fluoride from treated water
       <strong>
        does not reduce caries either systemically at 0.2ppm or topically from saliva at 0.02ppm.
       </strong>
       Instead it increases the incidence of unsightly abnormal dental fluorosis hypoplasia in all treated cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human case studies proved that abdominal discomfort occurs from drinking 1ppm artificially fluoridated water.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...salmon are unaffected by natural 1 ppm fluoride in ocean water where calcium is extremely high but are narcotized by industrial fluoride in soft water at only 0.3ppm

        No citizens have yet been exposed to industrial fluoride treated water for an entire human average lifetime of 75 years even though retained fluoride accumulates during chronic continuous exposure.

       Anyways, NONE of this is present with naturally occurring calcium fluoride, which you misleadingly stated.

       Fluoride is not a nutrient, nor is it essential for healthy teeth.
       <strong>
        No study has ever revealed a diseased state resulting from lack of fluoride, including dental caries.
       </strong>
       (1,2) No American is, or ever was, “fluoride deficient.”
      </p>
      <p>
       *
       <em>
        Using the water supply to mass medicate the population is unethical. The public water supply should not be used as a drug-delivery system without regard for an individual's age, weight, health status, or knowledge of how fluoride will interact with other drugs they are taking. No informed consent is requested or given, and no medical follow-up is offered. *
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The benefit and safety of ingested fluoride has never been proved by accepted medical standards. The HHS has failed to inform the public that there is not a single randomized controlled trial (the gold standard of medical research) that demonstrates the effectiveness of water fluoridation.
       </strong>
       (3) HHS has also failed to inform the public that the Food and Drug Administration has never studied, or approved, the safety of fluoride supplements and continues to classify all fluoride supplements as “unapproved new drugs.” (4, 5) Lastly, HHS has failed to inform the public that tooth decay rates have declined at the same general rate in all western, industrialized countries, irrespective of water fluoridation status. (6)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Any benefits of fluoride are primarily topical, not systemic.
       </strong>
       The CDC has acknowledged this for over a decade (7). The Iowa Fluoride Study, funded by HHS, has reported little, if any, relationship between individual fluoride intake and caries experience. According to the study (the largest of its kind): “achieving a caries-free status may have relatively little to do with fluoride intake, while fluorosis is clearly more dependent on fluoride intake." (8)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Americans will still be over-exposed to fluoride at 0.7 ppm. According to EPA’s recent documents “it is likely that most children, even those that live in fluoridated communities, can be over-exposed to fluoride at least occasionally.
       </strong>
       (9) At present, nearly 41% of American adolescents aged 12-15 have some form of dental fluorosis (10), an outwardly visible sign of fluoride toxicity. Reducing the fluoride levels to 0.7 ppm will not remedy this problem as national statistics clearly show that dental fluorosis remains significantly elevated at 0.7 ppm. (11) Drinking water is just one source of ingested fluoride; others include foods, beverages, dental products and supplements, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. For communities that practice artificial water fluoridation, this is the easiest source of fluoride to remove.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infants will not be protected. Infants fed formula made with fluoridated tap water—at the reduced level of 0.7 ppm—will still receive up to 175 times more fluoride than a breast-fed infant.** In their supporting documents, EPA has not calculated the risks to the bottle-fed infant. In fact, infants from birth to six months of age were completely excluded from any consideration by EPA, despite HHS’s own admission that “The period of possible risk for fluorosis in the permanent teeth…extends from about birth through 8 years of age." (12) As the most susceptible subpopulation, the potential for long-term, irreparable damage to developing infants must be seriously considered, and should extend beyond just their teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
       African-American children and low-income children will not be protected. HHS’s reference (p. 2386) to the study by Sohn et al. (13) failed to mention that African-American and low-income children were found to consume significantly more total fluids and plain water, and thus receive more fluoride from drinking water, than white or higher-income children. African-Americans have been shown to have an increased risk of developing dental fluorosis, and are at higher risk for suffering from the more severe forms of this condition. (14) Despite receiving high intakes of fluoride, low-income and minority children living in fluoridated communities continue to suffer from rampant and severe dental decay (15-18)—undermining the common premise that fluoridation will prevent these problems. Additionally, low-income children have a greater risk for suffering from all forms of fluoride toxicity, as poor diet exacerbates the detrimental effects of fluoride. This is clearly, therefore, an environmental justice issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        HHS has failed to consider fluoride’s impact on the brain. Over 100 animal studies have observed fluoride-induced brain damage
       </strong>
       (19), 24 human studies have reported lowered IQ in children exposed to various levels of fluoride (20), and at least 6 other studies have found non-IQ neurological effects such as impaired visuo-spatial organization. (21-26) One study of 500 children in China observed reduced IQ at a water fluoride level of 1.9 ppm (27, 28) and another reported a reduction in IQ at even lower (mean=1.3 ppm) water fluoride levels. (29) HHS’s new recommendation of 0.7 ppm offers no adequate margin of safety to protect all of our children, including those with iodine deficiencies (30-32), from experiencing similar neurological damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        HHS has failed to consider fluoride as an endocrine disruptor.
       </strong>
       The 2006 NRC report (33) states that fluoride is an endocrine disruptor, and even at low levels can be detrimental to the thyroid gland. Pre- and post-natal babies, people with kidney disease, and above-average water drinkers (including diabetics and lactating women) are especially susceptible to the endocrine disrupting effects of fluoride in drinking water.
      </p>
      <p>
       HHS has failed to consider or investigate current rates of skeletal fluorosis in the U.S. According to EPA's supporting document (34), there is a general lack of information on the prevalence of stage II skeletal fluorosis in the U.S. Yet, many of the symptoms of stage II skeletal fluorosis (e.g. sporadic pain, stiffness of the joints) are identical to arthritis (35-40), which affects at least 46 million Americans. People with renal insufficiency are known to be at an elevated risk for developing skeletal fluorosis (33), as crippling stage III skeletal fluorosis with renal deficiency has been documented in the U.S. at water fluoride levels as low as 1.7 ppm. (41) Since skeletal fluorosis in kidney patients has been detected in small case studies, it is likely that systematic studies would detect skeletal fluorosis at even lower fluoride levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        HHS has failed to consider fluoride as a potential carcinogen.
       </strong>
       Bassin et al. (42) reported a significantly elevated risk of osteosarcoma in boys living in fluoridated communities, and thus fluoride may be a carcinogen. Chester Douglass, who has serious conflicts-of-interest concerning fluoride research, has stated that a subsequent study will refute these findings (43), but no publication has appeared in the five years since he made this claim.
       <strong>
        As EPA has still not completed carcinogenicity testing for fluoride, HHS should not support the addition of a potential carcinogen to our drinking water.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       HHS has failed to confirm the safety of silicofluorides. Despite being used in more than 90% of artificial water fluoridation schemes, no chronic toxicity testing of silicofluorides has ever been completed: “No short-term or subchronic exposure, chronic exposure, cytotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, teratology, carcinogenicity, or initiation/promotion studies were available” for the toxicological summary for silicofluorides, as prepared for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. (44) However, recent epidemiological research has found an association between the use of silicofluoride-treated community water and increased blood lead concentrations in children (45) – a link that is consistent with recent laboratory findings. (46) HHS has failed to inform the American public that the fluoridating agent used in drinking water is a hazardous waste product from the phosphate fertilizer industry, and can be laced with arsenic and radionuclides, (47, 48) which are known carcinogens. HHS should not support the addition of a non-tested substance to our drinking water.

       Fun fact from that article:

      <p>
       <em>
        It was 2007 when the American Dental Association (ADA) first warned that parents of infants younger than a year old "should consider using water that has no or low levels of fluoride"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it's the ADA, shouldn't you know about this? You haven't mentioned it once! Amazing, huh.

       Which cannot be measured since it's in more than just tap water. This guideline is completely useless in the way it's suggested since no one actively monitors, measures or has individual medical support at all times.

      <p>
       There is no way to measure fluoride intake on a daily basis, therefore nullifying this suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way to do this is eliminate sodium fluoride from all sources and only those that need it should take it, but then again there is no evidence anyone needs it or has any deficiency from lack of it.
      </p>

       Which you still cannot give any useful advice on accomplishing this, like I said since no one actively monitors, measures or has individual medical support at all times. Any regular medication intake requires medical observation, which is not present with water fluoridation. In this context this practice is completely unethical.

       You still failed to prove anyone needs it or has any deficiency from lack of it based on those studies done by the WHO. If this medication has no evidence to support its benefit it shouldn't be used at all. It's a useless toxic.

       Your "confounding variable" claims only prove that as people get older, their dental habits improve, which is also nothing but conjecture, there is no evidence to prove this, and since children are warned specifically to avoid it, it makes those that would need it, if it were proved to be the case, an extremely small group, not worth polluting whole water sources just to satisfy a tiny group that would have any benefit if there was such a thing.

It is a common belief that the wide distribution of fluoride from toothpastes may be a major explanation (Bratthall et al., 1996), but serious attempts to assess the role of fluoridated toothpastes have been able to attribute, at best, about 40-50% of the caries reduction to these fluoride products (Marthaler, 1990; Scheie, 1992).

       The issue is that fluoride does
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       in regards to dental health, as stated by
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/25d3cm/fluoride_was_first_used_in_nazi_camps/chk48q7">
        various instituions worldwide

        During the past 40 years dental caries has been declining in the US, as well as in most other developed nations of the world...
        <strong>
         The decline in dental caries has occurred both in fluoride and in fluoride-deficient communities
        </strong>
        , lending further credence to the notion that modes other than water fluoridation, especially dentrifices, have made a major contribution.

       <p>
        It is remarkable, however, that the dramatic decline in dental caries which we have witnessed in many different parts of the world (for reviews, see Glass, 1982; Fejerskov and Baelum, 1998)
        <strong>
         has occurred without the dental profession being fully able to explain the relative role of fluoride in this intriguing process
        </strong>
        . It is a common belief that the wide distribution of fluoride from toothpastes may be a major explanation (Bratthall et al., 1996), but serious attempts to assess the role of fluoridated toothpastes have been able to attribute, at best, about 40-50% of the caries reduction to these fluoride products (Marthaler, 1990; Scheie, 1992).
        <strong>
         This is not surprising, if one takes into account the fact that dental caries is not the result of fluoride deficiency.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Graphs of tooth decay trends for 12 year olds in 24 countries, prepared using the most recent World Health Organization data, show that the decline in dental decay in recent decades has been comparable in 16 nonfluoridated countries and 8 fluoridated countries which met the inclusion criteria of having (i) a mean annual per capita income in the year 2000 of US$10,000 or more, (ii) a population in the year 2000 of greater than 3 million, and (iii) suitable WHO caries data available.
        <strong>
         The WHO data do not support fluoridation as being a reason for the decline in dental decay in 12 year olds that has been occurring in recent decades.

        Although the prevalence of caries varies between countries, levels everywhere have fallen greatly in the past three decades, and national rates of caries are now universally low.

         This trend has occurred regardless of the concentration of fluoride in water or the use of fluoridated salt

       While it was/is widely used in the chemical industry, I have yet to see any evidence that fluoride was ever used for that purpose by depression/WWII era Germans or Soviets (though I don't deny it's currently being used for that purpose on Americans); it seems to be a rumor among the anti-fluoride community that derived from a previous rumor which spread during the 1970's and 80's; that Germans and Soviets were dosing the water in their concentration camps with potassium chloride for the same purpose. While potassium chloride does not have that property; it is global SOP to supplement canned food diets with potassium chloride to balance the high salt intake; the WWII era US military, for example, issued potassium chloride tablets for this purpose, and to prevent rumors of water tampering; but that could not be done in prisons because of the fear of being poisoned.

       There are many, highly reasonable reasons to be against fluoridation, but unless you can provide a reliable source for the death camps claim, this does not appear to be one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Our Holocaust historian knew of no such project. Two book authors who researched the topic, one a journalist, the other a hydrologist, found no credible evidence of such a connection. A leading anti-fluoridation activist repudiates the story. The most commonly cited Web source for the story was a 16-year-old extract in a fringe Australian publication. "

       “The average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points for commonly used IQ scores with a standard deviation of 15.*  Some studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. “

       Mathematical data? You do realize you're talking about your own Reddit post, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The researchers that conducted that study must have had good reason for using the quantities that they did. If you do not like it, then I suggest you conduct your own study and get back to me when you have. Either that, or find studies that involve 4ppm (
       <a href="http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/fluoride.cfm">
        the EPA's Maximum Contaminant Level Goal
       </a>
       which is far above your .7mg/litre)
I would love to see them. Thus far, the lowest quantities I have been able to find involve 25ppm and a control group. In case you're wondering, there were many negative effect. (Dentine dysplasia,
degeneration of ameloblasts, attrition, deformity, and discoloration of teeth )

       There is much evidence to suggest that fluoride has had little to no impact against tooth decay and we can actually thank a higher standard of living for that benefit, not fluoride. Many areas without fluoride have actually seen a greater reduction in tooth decay that in fluoridated areas, such as the one listed in this article --&gt;
       <a href="http://www.ffo-olf.org/NewEvidenceOnFluoridation.html">
        Colquhoun J. New evidence on fluoridation. Social Science and Medicine 19 1239-1246 1984.
       </a>
       (Don't crap on the source again as this link is merely a transcription from a medical journal.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Within stating, " In our view, the evidence indicates that fluoridation entails real health risks and at best very small benefits. Therefore, the fluoridation of water supplies should be terminated forthwith."
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just amazing to me that there are people like you that exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       You put down anyone's argument for lack of "credible sources". And, when not one, but TWO very credible studies are put in front of you, you immediately dismiss them because somehow your math is better? Maybe all peer reviews should be sent to reddit user dancerathlete before they can finally be deemed credible?

      <p>
       THAT is ridiculous.

        Impact of fluoride on neurological development in children (lowering of IQ)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “The average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points for commonly used IQ scores with a standard deviation of 15.*  Some studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. “

       Your source as well as your initial claim that's naturally ocurring is an outright lie due to the fact that what's being introduced is sodium, not calcium fluoride. They are completely different compounds that

        require

        this is not on the 2001 report

       . Odd isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact from that article:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        It was 2007 when the American Dental Association (ADA) first warned that parents of infants younger than a year old "should consider using water that has no or low levels of fluoride"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it's the ADA, shouldn't you know about this? You haven't mentioned it once! Amazing, huh.
