    <div class="md"><p>Here is a great argument for why they aren&#39;t faked. The landings took place in the height of the Cold War, when both sides would take any chance they could get to create propaganda discrediting the other side. We know the Russians followed the mission, <em>but they never claimed it was faked, despite the massive amount of propaganda that they could make from it</em>. Also, most of the evidence given for the theory the landings were faked is easily debunked, not to mention the third party evidence does give even more weight to the landings being real.</p>

Don&#39;t stop after the first mention of extensive cooperation in 1980, there was a nearly-constant exchange of information in short bursts between international incidents.  Russia was fully and publicly cooperating with NASA shortly after the first manned moon landing, and much cooperation preceded this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russians almost certainly suspected the moon landings were fake. Why did they say nothing? Several reasons. </p>

<p>1) They couldn&#39;t prove it. It is very hard to prove that someone didn&#39;t land on the moon - what evidence would they have used? The small risk that they might be wrong was sufficient deterrent to keep them from speaking out.</p>

<p>2) If Russia had expressed it doubts, it would have looked like politically motivated sour grapes, and it could have backfired on them. The USSR, like many regimes, was driven by a strong compulsion not to lose face.</p>

<p>3) The Russians assumed that the USA&#39;s outrageous hoax would be uncovered in due course, and it would be better for somebody else to expose it. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well the reason they couldn&#39;t prove it is because all evidence <em>points to us actually going to the moon</em>. That&#39;s kinda the point here, is that it means the Russians looked at the evidence and agreed that it wasn&#39;t faked. </p>

<p>And so does the US. All the Russians have to do is even dare to accuse the US of faking the landing, and they already would have the upper hand. </p>

<p>What? The whole point is that it would be better for them to do it. Why would they possibly wait for anyone else to take the credit for this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The key words there are &quot;think&quot; and &quot;believe&quot;. The Russians followed the missions. In fact, as mentioned in the third party evidence article, quite a few people followed the missions progress. Again, if the Russians had any reason to think it was faked, they would be able to easily call out the US, but they didn&#39;t. Also, if the astronauts just orbited the earth and never went past it, then we&#39;d definitely know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can track the ISS with the naked eye. With $20 10x50 binoculars you can track other satellites as well. <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/">Here&#39;s a site that will tell you when and where to look.</a></p>

<p>Venus, Jupiter and Saturn, along with the Andromeda Galaxy, are viewable to the naked eye as well. The el-cheapo 10x50 binoculars will show a couple of Jupiter&#39;s moons assuming light pollution isn&#39;t terrible in your area.</p>

<p>While you have the binoculars out, you might as well find some Messier objects. <a href="http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/binomess/binomess.html">Here&#39;s a link to Messier objects viewable with binoculars.</a> There are two lists- one for 20MM to 50MM binos and one for 56MM-80MM binos. The &quot;50&quot; in 10x50 is 50MM so you&#39;ll want the first list. There are &quot;backyard&quot; versions of the list as well that are intended for light polluted viewing by eliminating the weaker Messier objects.</p>

<p>I recommend starting with the brightest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster">globular clusters</a> as they&#39;re easiest to spot. They&#39;ll look like smudges through 50MM binos and like cotton balls through 70MM binos and small telescopes.</p>

<p>There are numerous star charts (astronomy, not astrology) and star chart apps to help locate things. <a href="http://www.skymaps.com/downloads.html">The Evening Sky Map</a> is an excellent guide to celestial objects and events in the current month. It&#39;s formatted for printing and only two pages. Oh, and it&#39;s free. Bookmark the site and come back next month to print off the new guide. A planisphere <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1928771017/skymaps">like this one</a> is good for grab-n-go. It&#39;s a slide guide that&#39;s good year round. It&#39;s more broad in scope and focuses mostly on constellations. But, unless you&#39;re using GPS, you&#39;ll be using those constellations as a reference to find the Messier Objects (called &quot;star hopping&quot;). As far as apps go, <a href="http://vitotechnology.com/star-walk.html">Star Walk</a> is by far the best, IMO.</p>

<p>Your local astronomy club will be glad to help as well. Just might not wanna mention that moon landing hoax thing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the propaganda campaign to &quot;preserve lunar history&quot; by staying away from moon landing sites that really made me question it.  Seriously, how does staying away preserve history?  Maybe stay away from the first site, but what about landing site 6/7?  And why does there have to be legislation supporting this idea?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t even have the best pictures and such of them.  It&#39;s not necessary to put legal restrictions on the space within a mile of each site in all directions.  If another nation visits the moon and wants to get close enough to a moon landing site to see it, they shouldn&#39;t need permission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By proclaiming it to be a National Park it would seem to me to be doing the exact opposite of that, since the whole point of National Parks is that they&#39;re public space everyone is allowed to visit.</p>

<p>Also, did this bill even pass? And why wait 40 years after the fact to propose a bill like this, if it&#39;s somehow connected to faking the moon landing?</p>

<p>One thing I will say, though, is that it might get Americans feeling like the Moon somehow belongs to us, which is a dangerous line of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the Chinese space program is gaining speed.  What if the Chinese visit the moon now, check out an Apollo site, and declare that they are in fact the first people to set foot on the moon.  Such legislation would give the US a legitimate claim that the Chinese had no respect for violating our policy of visiting our sites in the first place, so they are probably full of shit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the specific rationale behind this bill and the associated mainstream propaganda, but the official reasoning for wanting this smells like BS to me.</p>

<p>What&#39;s to stop them from landing on the moon SAYING they are at the Apollo site and CLAIMING that they dont see anything? There would be no way for any of us to say otherwise. </p>
