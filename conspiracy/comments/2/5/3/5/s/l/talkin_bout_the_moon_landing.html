       To believe the Apollo missions took men to the moon and back time after time is an act of faith.  It was over 40 years ago, and the

        The third party evidence of the moon landing
       </a>
       is not very conclusive.  I first doubted the Apollo missions when
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=moon+landing+national+parks&amp;oq=moon+landing+national+parks&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3590j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">

        legal action to make it illegal for anyone to go anywhere near any of the Apollo sites
       </a>
       .  They say they want people to stay away to preserve lunar history, but since Neil Armstrong left the damn camera on the moon, I'd say checking out the landing sites would do more for lunar history than making them forbidden!

       Here is a great argument for why they aren't faked. The landings took place in the height of the Cold War, when both sides would take any chance they could get to create propaganda discrediting the other side. We know the Russians followed the mission,
       <em>
        but they never claimed it was faked, despite the massive amount of propaganda that they could make from it
       </em>
       . Also, most of the evidence given for the theory the landings were faked is easily debunked, not to mention the third party evidence does give even more weight to the landings being real.

       I used to have a better article,
       <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/50th/50th_magazine/coldWarCoOp.html">
        but this should suffice
       </a>
       .  Don't stop after the first mention of extensive cooperation in 1980, there was a nearly-constant exchange of information in short bursts between international incidents.  Russia was fully and publicly cooperating with NASA shortly after the first manned moon landing, and much cooperation preceded this.

       It sounds like there was cooperation, which would mean that the USSR could easily look at what they were shown/given and be able to tell it wouldn't get someone to the moon.The fact that even with all this new information they didn't say anything just seems like more proof it wasn't faked.

       Well, if you say so.  Personally, I think the extensive cooperation between "rival nations" weakens the whistle-blower argument, but it's all up for interpretation.

       I guess it depends on how you look at it, but it just seems to me like all this info would make it easier for the USSR to debunk the landings, assuming they didn't happen.

       The Russians almost certainly suspected the moon landings were fake. Why did they say nothing? Several reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) They couldn't prove it. It is very hard to prove that someone didn't land on the moon - what evidence would they have used? The small risk that they might be wrong was sufficient deterrent to keep them from speaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) If Russia had expressed it doubts, it would have looked like politically motivated sour grapes, and it could have backfired on them. The USSR, like many regimes, was driven by a strong compulsion not to lose face.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The Russians assumed that the USA's outrageous hoax would be uncovered in due course, and it would be better for somebody else to expose it.

       Well the reason they couldn't prove it is because all evidence
       <em>
        points to us actually going to the moon
       </em>
       . That's kinda the point here, is that it means the Russians looked at the evidence and agreed that it wasn't faked.

       And so does the US. All the Russians have to do is even dare to accuse the US of faking the landing, and they already would have the upper hand.

       What? The whole point is that it would be better for them to do it. Why would they possibly wait for anyone else to take the credit for this?

       I don't believe the Russians could have followed the missions all the way to the moon.  After a certain distance they wouldn't be able to confirm the location of the spacecraft either visually or with any kind of radar I'm familiar with.

       The key words there are "think" and "believe". The Russians followed the missions. In fact, as mentioned in the third party evidence article, quite a few people followed the missions progress. Again, if the Russians had any reason to think it was faked, they would be able to easily call out the US, but they didn't. Also, if the astronauts just orbited the earth and never went past it, then we'd definitely know.

       It's a pretty decent argument, especially considering the time it took place. Also, if you would give me any reasons it didn't happen, I'd be more then willing to debunk them.

       That's not an answer. I asked you quite simply to give me any evidence it was faked. You instead completely ignored it. You also never explained what is wrong with the Russia argument, just that "it's weak", without actually explaining how.

       You can track the ISS with the naked eye. With $20 10x50 binoculars you can track other satellites as well.
       <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/">
        Here's a site that will tell you when and where to look.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Venus, Jupiter and Saturn, along with the Andromeda Galaxy, are viewable to the naked eye as well. The el-cheapo 10x50 binoculars will show a couple of Jupiter's moons assuming light pollution isn't terrible in your area.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you have the binoculars out, you might as well find some Messier objects.
       <a href="http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/binomess/binomess.html">
        Here's a link to Messier objects viewable with binoculars.
       </a>
       There are two lists- one for 20MM to 50MM binos and one for 56MM-80MM binos. The "50" in 10x50 is 50MM so you'll want the first list. There are "backyard" versions of the list as well that are intended for light polluted viewing by eliminating the weaker Messier objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend starting with the brightest
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster">
        globular clusters
       </a>
       as they're easiest to spot. They'll look like smudges through 50MM binos and like cotton balls through 70MM binos and small telescopes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are numerous star charts (astronomy, not astrology) and star chart apps to help locate things.
       <a href="http://www.skymaps.com/downloads.html">
        The Evening Sky Map
       </a>
       is an excellent guide to celestial objects and events in the current month. It's formatted for printing and only two pages. Oh, and it's free. Bookmark the site and come back next month to print off the new guide. A planisphere

       </a>
       is good for grab-n-go. It's a slide guide that's good year round. It's more broad in scope and focuses mostly on constellations. But, unless you're using GPS, you'll be using those constellations as a reference to find the Messier Objects (called "star hopping"). As far as apps go,
       <a href="http://vitotechnology.com/star-walk.html">

       is by far the best, IMO.

       Pluto is a planet*, it's fucking HUGE!  And they drop the shuttle after it burns all it's fuel, and continue onward in just a little orbiter.  The actual craft they were in was small.

       If those things are real, then it seems to me hard to believe they'd fake the moon landing (and the dozen or so other missions that went there, as well as other areas of space). I mean, why fake it if they clearly can do it and want to do it, and consistently do related missions? Just fake the one moon landing but everything else is real?

       Ya, I believe in those things.  I was reluctant to disbelieve the moon landing because Voyager seemed more impressive, and Voyager is so clearly real.

       It's the propaganda campaign to "preserve lunar history" by staying away from moon landing sites that really made me question it.  Seriously, how does staying away preserve history?  Maybe stay away from the first site, but what about landing site 6/7?  And why does there have to be legislation supporting this idea?

       I clicked the link to the law you referenced; my understanding is they're proclaiming the landing sites on the Moon to be a National Park. It seems like mostly a symbolic act. They're not telling anyone to stay away from anything, as far as I can tell.

       It would give the US government legal control over access to the sites.  I think its the start of an effort to get Americans in a mindset where it's a good thing to never re-visit the apollo sites.

       We don't even have the best pictures and such of them.  It's not necessary to put legal restrictions on the space within a mile of each site in all directions.  If another nation visits the moon and wants to get close enough to a moon landing site to see it, they shouldn't need permission.

       By proclaiming it to be a National Park it would seem to me to be doing the exact opposite of that, since the whole point of National Parks is that they're public space everyone is allowed to visit.

       Also, did this bill even pass? And why wait 40 years after the fact to propose a bill like this, if it's somehow connected to faking the moon landing?

       One thing I will say, though, is that it might get Americans feeling like the Moon somehow belongs to us, which is a dangerous line of thinking.

       Well the Chinese space program is gaining speed.  What if the Chinese visit the moon now, check out an Apollo site, and declare that they are in fact the first people to set foot on the moon.  Such legislation would give the US a legitimate claim that the Chinese had no respect for violating our policy of visiting our sites in the first place, so they are probably full of shit.

       I don't know the specific rationale behind this bill and the associated mainstream propaganda, but the official reasoning for wanting this smells like BS to me.

       so, how would the US even be able to stop a Chinese or anyone else from visiting the sites? saying that the US has deemed these landind areas as sacred no no spots as proof the landing are fake absurd seeing that there would be no way to enforce it anyway.

       Aside from the fact that you're in your own fairy tale world where it's "your way or the wrong way", I could point out many of the flaws in the davesweb thing. That being said, I have the feeling that you would just skim over what I wrote and claim it's all wrong.

       A perfect case of ignorance is bliss.  He'll do just as you said "skim over it and claim it's all wrong".
