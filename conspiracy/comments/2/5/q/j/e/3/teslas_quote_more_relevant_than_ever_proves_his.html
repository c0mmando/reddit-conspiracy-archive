    <div class="md"><p>True. I also read about some vote manipulation that reddit does to eliminate the effect of shadow banned voting bots trying to manipulate the true net voting position of the post. </p>

<p>In theory it sounds like a necessary evil, but it does muddy the waters considerably on what people&#39;s actual views are on a given topic. </p>

<p>To me a topic can have a net positive 500 upvotes, but my interpretation of public opinion on it will be considerably different if it comes from 600 ups and 100 downs versus 6,000 ups and 5,500 downs. The reddit algorithm basically posits that the 500 net upvotes is all that matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is, now. Most downvoting will occur when a post is brand new, to keep it from rising to where more people will see it. This kind of downvoting doesn&#39;t get a lot of attention. However if there is enough push to keep it up, the downvotes will stop, as continuing with them would be far too obvious. Usually at that point tactics are switched to their version of &#39;harm reduction&#39;, to keep the impact as low as possible. These tactics will be things such as pumping the comments full of counter-arguments as well as  for-arguments that are peppered with unpopular opinions like racism, so that anyone reading over will think that those for it are &#39;those kinds of people&#39;, seriously lowering the impact it might otherwise bring.</p>

<p>The U.S. Patent Office has a committee that screens patents in order to protect &quot;national security&quot;. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/181">U.S. Code › Title 35 › Part II › Chapter 17 › § 181 35 U.S. Code § 181 - Secrecy of certain inventions and withholding of patent</a></p>

<p>According to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5I5c9j8BEn4C&amp;amp;pg=PA369">this book</a>, Tesla was talking about electrically-driven turbines, like <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US1061206.pdf">this patent</a>, which Tesla filed in 1911.</p>

<p>Why would you think that? There are jet turbine machines that hover, like the Harrier or the Joint Strike Fighter. Why wouldn&#39;t an electric turbine be able to hover, in principle? Tesla envisioned the electrical power being transmitted from the ground, so the weight of the batteries wouldn&#39;t be an issue (if that would have worked).</p>

<p>It probably isn&#39;t practical, but lots of Tesla&#39;s ideas weren&#39;t practical.</p>

<p>Tesla lived another 30 years, you know.

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh.  Does this subreddit not know what the word &quot;proof&quot; means or entails? A single quote a something written in a news article mentioning some idea he had does not constitute proof.  At best it might be a mild suggestion of something, especially given that it is 100 years apart.  </p>

<p>I mean, come on.  I know the internet has a hard-on for Tesla and all, but just looking at it critically, it seems highly unlikely that he was more than 100 years advanced in scientific discovery.  Even Einstein can&#39;t claim such accolades.  </p>

r n d. more everything. wake the fuck up already. also. alien life exist. yes lil green grey brown. whateever exist. even plant they can talk and have brain. in other planets. life had different path of evolution and other species became the top of the food chain or different apex predator. so stop thinking inside the box and break the fucking tape already. you are all sickening</p>

I&#39;m sure there are people bothered by it or oblivious to it in the military, but if they were the majority then these developments would not have the momentum they do. There were and probably still are dissenters in the NSA, in banks, in big food companies etc but to dismiss the obvious ulterior motives at work because some of the rank and file are still decent humans doesn&#39;t really seem like a useful viewpoint. Obviously not most or all of the military is bothered by the mil-ind complex or they would restructure themselves. So what is &quot;those in the military&quot; for you? Some personal buddies? Forgotten vets? I read occasional stories where they speak out but it isn&#39;t the majority or the leadership, and if it is neither of those then how much of the military is it, really? At some point, if the situation these dissenters are in is morally abhorrent to them then they have a personal duty to stop participating, and I am not seeing that happen in a significant way right now, which is why I&#39;ve said everything I&#39;ve said. I realize the military is pretty harsh on whistleblowers, but at some point being too scared or unwilling to blow the whistle or resist or whatever makes them complicit in the crime(s).</p>

<p>The generals pushing around the exxon pieces and deciding if each section of a new green zone gets a subway or a mcds on their strategy maps don&#39;t care if the pawns are happy/healthy or not, as long as they keep doing what they&#39;re told to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all of them do.  Have you heard of Bradley Manning?</p>

<p>I actually support those conflicts you listed because they involve undermining people and regimes that hate us.  That&#39;s exactly what our military should be doing.  Sure there&#39;s bullshit rhetoric for the actual reasons, but those are lies for the rest of the world and I&#39;m fine with that.  The idea that we went into Iraq to help their civilians is to deceive the rest of the world.  Nobody invades a country as a favor to the people of that country.  The military has no good reason to defect right now, and you&#39;re mistaken if you think a large percentage of them would point their weapons at US citizens.</p>

<p>8.6 Questioner: How did the United States learn of the technology to build these land [inaudible]?</p>

<p>Ra: I am Ra. There was a mind/body/spirit complex known to your people by the vibratory sound complex, Nikola. This entity departed the illusion and the papers containing the necessary understandings were taken by mind/body/spirit complexes serving your security of national divisional complex. Thus your people became privy to the basic technology. In the case of those mind/body/spirit complexes which you call Russians, the technology was given from one of the Confederation in an attempt, approximately twenty-seven of your years ago, to share information and bring about peace among your peoples. The entities giving this information were in error, but we did many things at the end of this cycle in attempts to aid your harvest from which we learned the folly of certain types of aid. That is a contributing factor to our more cautious approach at this date, even as the need is power upon power greater, and your people’s call is greater and greater.
