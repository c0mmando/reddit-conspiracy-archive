       <strong>
        Barack Obama was crystal clear during the 2008 campaign about his commitment to ensuring equal treatment of all online content over American broadband lines. “I will take a backseat to no one in my commitment to network neutrality,” Obama told a crowd at Google in 2008. “Because once providers start to privilege some applications or websites over others then the smaller voices get squeezed out and we all lose.”

       Ummm, we've known Obama is a crock of shit for years now. He's "the man's" man.

      <p>
       All control, all resources, all power is now in the hands of the .001%... they've successfully destroyed democracy and taken control of the country.

       As time goes on it will get more and more evident to average citizens as they start implementing things that affect their day to day lives. Slower web pages will be the least of everyone's problems.

       It really just goes to show how far ahead in thinking and strategy the true rulers and oligarchs of this country are in their skill and understanding of the voting population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was always an insider but shallow marketing and lack of deeper curiosity from his base of voters (who can't see anything more than R/D) convinced tens of millions of people that he was different, that things were going to radically change. It was well into his second term when I've seen supporters actively saying they regret voting for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's amazing to me because Obama was basically elevated and put into presidential office by unseen and unpublicized forces. He was a freshmen Senator, albeit charismatic and well spoken (as long as he has a teleprompter). The powers that be knew he would be seen as a unique product, an intelligent, successful black man. Surely he won't do what the typical evil white politicians will do! He's so much better than Bush! (despite continuing, defending and expanding many of Bush's policies)
      </p>
      <p>
       And here we are, Obama is the same as Bush on so many different things. We have had a Bush or Clinton involved in every election for the last three decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're being duped, time and time again. But there are so many people who are not savvy to this deception and continue to play the us versus them sports mentality game the powers that be want them to play. Ignore boring domestic and foreign politics and economics all you need to know is whether they have an R or D next to their name!

       The toughest thing for people to see is that the game was lost a long time ago. We don't have a democracy anymore, we have a plutocracy (one that is morphing into a global plutocracy). Corporations and dirty politicians rule everything at this point... and once you get that stranglehold it becomes almost impossible to reverse things (which is why countries fall into violent revolutions).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only question is whether people will revolt or simply accept that their future is one of servitude. You would think that the would revolt... but you look around the world and there are billions of people who live in poverty and never unite against the ones keeping them in poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect the same will be the case here. If the people haven't woken up yet after everything that has gone on, they never will.

       Just as a general practice, I find it helpful whenever Obama says anything, to assume the opposite to be true.  I mean this policy works for most politicians, however it seems the president is completely incapable of speaking the truth about anything... except for occasions like the correspondent's dinner, where he lampooned his mistakes in office, anyone have any examples that might prove me wrong?

       What nobody here is saying:

      <p>
       The FCC vote was a
       <em>
        party line
       </em>
       vote, 3-2.  Three Republicans voted against 2 Democrats.  The Republicans are anti-Net Neutrality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Question:  Why is Obama going with the Republicans?  Because "all parties are the same"?  Or because Obama is a Republican mole, and has been, all along?
