       Well then the answer is that the public will be less likely to be manipulated into more wars using false flags.  We may see criminal prosecutions, and the neo-conservatives who influence both the right and some of the left today will be shunned and ignored by both.  The excuse for the 8x increase over Clinton-era Pentagon spending has been the War on Terrorism, if the public knew the truth; the military industrial complex would be deflated and the world would be a safer place.

       The recent fictional movie, "The Conspiracy," has some answer to OP question, and it is not as GNUgamer says.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the movie, an important leader looks into the camera and says, "Yes, there is a conspiracy, we are doing what you say, and, we will continue to do it, and there is nothing that you can do about it."

       They very well could do something like this. If the public outcry is so immense and they don't have a fall-guy or media contingency plan, who knows what the US would do when backed into a corner by their own people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these people have absolute power and are already willing to attack their own people to further their agenda, who can say what lengths they would be willing to go to hold on to that power? Even if it means attempting to dismantle democracy.

       If it was proved beyond doubt, there would be riots here in the US. There would be vigilante justice most likely. Many guilty people would escape notice or flee. The media would call for calm, most likely directed by those in real power who were involved that may have enough distance from events to shield themselves from discovery. There would be a debate on whether to apply the federal criminal courts or military tribunals. The alphabet soup agencies would come under intense scrutiny as to what they knew when and their involvement. If citizens were not satisfied with the results of investigations and convictions, there might follow a wave of home-grown terrorism directed against the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Middle East would explode. There would be unmitigated rage as the real reasons for the multiple wars that have claimed so many lives would be laid bare. If the real reason for 9/11 was to invade and subjugate the Middle East, the whole thing might backfire spectacularly with those nations forming a real alliance against the west and EU. China and Russia would benefit immensely.
      </p>
      <p>
       If other nations (or state actors within) were found to be part of a plot there would be international manhunts and trials. Trade embargoes, threats of military action, treaties and alliances would fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all best case scenario. Worst case, Webster Tarpley was right and the message "Angel is next" was accompanied by in his words "cosmic codes" that were US STRATCOM codes used to launch nuclear missiles, and knowing they were caught, the hidden government would launch missiles, start WWIII and hope everyone forgets about that pesky 9/11 thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: little content and clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further edit: I should note there would also likely be quite a few high profile assassinations as the people at the very top try to eliminate those that could testify against them (if they hadn't already been identified) and assassinations against people who had been taken into custody, Jack Ruby style.

       Doubt it. Most people want an easy life of consuming and watching TV. That is the sad reality. Also, as CIA director Allen Dulles said about JFK's murder: "American people don't read". Even when the truth is exposed people don't read about it. They'd rather watch America's Next Top Model or some shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But nobody reads. Don't believe people read in this country. There will be a few professors that will read the record... the public will read very little. - Allen Dulles, 7-9-64."
      </p>
      <p>
       You just have to look at the financial scams in recent years that were done in plain view of the public. There should have been riots across the US about that. There was nothing.

       But those financial crimes are so far removed from what people can understand. And there was that occupy thing, but they got their asses beaten by the police and that solved that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regular folks understand treason though!
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the whole 'Murica, support the troops, type folks will be the instigators of violence, then there's militia-tacticool guys, followed closely by the anarchist types and the tea party take our country back crowd. We have this weirdly warped patriotism in this country that has developed since 9/11. I think the psychological break that will occur when people see that their well intentioned and heartfelt patriotism was used against them will be the trigger that will make people snap.

       What will be the real deciding factor will be current and ex-military, especially the ex-military who served recently, those guys will be pissed beyond belief.

       Maybe. I honestly don't know enough about him/OK. It was rumored he was ex-military, but maybe he was still military and set up as a patsy. I saw a good documentary on that once, but it was a while back. There are serious questions about OK that the documentary raised. There was a cop, detective maybe, that was asking to many questions about that bombing. He ended up dead in a field, signs of torture and struggle, and of course it was called a suicide.

       But in a general sense, if you train a dog to kill, don't be surprised when it attacks you. So yeah, maybe McVeigh style shit would go down. It wouldn't shock me.

       There was a post of a YouTube clip from a presentation by Webster Tarpley on here a day or two ago. He said there was a threat made against Airforce One right after the attacks were underway that called it by it's code name Angel. His theory is that this was the Secret Government speaking, they threatened Bush to go along with the Fait Accompli or he'd be dead. I did a little digging and contrary to what Tarpley said, the code word wasn't a secret. Not something that was top secret, but not well known either. It was just a radio call sign that had been in the public domain for some time, but was not widely published or known. When the POTUS wasn't on Airforce One, it's radio call sign was 2600. That being said, IMO it isn't the type of thing a terrorist would say, they would say the president is next or Airforce one is next, the implication being that whoever sent the message knew a thing or two about security regarding the president and was an insider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, one of the statements that Tarpley made in that video is that the threat was accompanied by undisclosed codes--he called them "cosmic codes" and that they were STRATCOM launch codes for nuclear missiles. He surmised that the threat was you make this war on the Middle East, or we'll do it for you with nukes. It's plausible, when a nuke sub gets it's codes, they are trained to launch, they don't ask questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I looked around and could find no other reference to these codes being a part of the threat message. I didn't look very hard though. However, here is Chapter 9 of Tarpley's book, and it doesn't mention these codes that he talks about in the video, which I find odd:

       The same thing that happened after the JFK assassination - not much. Once a belief pattern is set, it is virtually impossible to change even if all perpetrators went on TV and confessed. I honestly don't think people would believe GWB if he confessed in person.

       9/11 would have to be blown open in a spectacular way to cause any change. That change would probably not be a violent one, just everyone realizing all at once that the leadership had to be replaced immediately and going about the business of doing it. At least that's what I would hope for.

       Yeah it would have to be such an undebatable piece of evidence that no one can possibly deny it. If it wasn't that solid it will be marginalized like every other piece of evidence.

       Found it.... 3 part series. It's pretty long. The first part is mostly circumstantial, but raises really good points. Parts 2 and 3 put the nail in the coffin. There won't be any doubt when you're done.
