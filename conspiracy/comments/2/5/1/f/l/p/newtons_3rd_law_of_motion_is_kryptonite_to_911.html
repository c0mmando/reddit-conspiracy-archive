       Newton's 3rd law states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
The statement means that in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object equals the size of the force on the second object. The direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object. Forces always come in pairs - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Forces always come in pairs. How does this pertain to the demolition of both WTC1 and WTC2? Let's set up a simple example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A= top 15 floors of tower
       </p>
       <p>
        B= bottom 88 floors of tower
       </p>
       <p>
        Newton's 3rd law of motion states "in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object (A) equals the size of the force on the second object (B). The direction of the force on the first object (A)is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object (B). Forces always come in pairs - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The logical next step is to find the
       <em>
        unaccounted for energy source
       </em>
       for the remainder of the collapse sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity can only account for a portion of the energy that brought down either WTC1 or WTC2.
Debunkers will insist that gravity
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the unaccounted for energy source. Which brings us back to debunkers ignoring Newton's 3rd law.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In other words, the momentum (which equals mass times velocity) of the 12 to 28 stories (WTC 1 and WTC 2, respectively) falling on the supporting structure below (which was designed to support only the static weight of the floors above and not any dynamic effects due to the downward momentum) so greatly exceeded the strength capacity of the structure below that it (the structure below) was unable to stop or even to slow the falling mass. The downward momentum felt by each successive lower floor was even larger due to the increasing mass.

       Its also not 15 floors versus 88 floors. Its 15 floors vs 88 floors that most are damaged an on fire, that's the part he is ignoring. Its not as if the top 15 floors fell on the others, the building was hit by a plane, that's one force that had a reaction of the structure being weakend as a whole(I know these building are designed to take a plane hit, not like this and not withous serious damage to the entire structure)nther force is the fire itself. It doesn't have to melt the steel just weaken it enough so it gives. Another force would be on the second tower after the first colapsed further weakaning its structure.

       So "most" of the 88 floors were "damaged and on fire" from a plane that crashed into what? 5 of them?  Six at most?  How did the plane manage to damage the remaining 80+ floors?

       The fire from the jet fuel and the stress of the impact on the rest of the building. Also in the case of this building damage from the first one falling, basically center of a small earth quake happend right next to it. Something most forget about the situation.

       Now you're completely switching topics.  We were specifically discussing your claim that "most" of the 88 floors were "damaged and on fire" from a plane that crashed into only a few of those 88 floors.

       So all that smoke comming from the building was from?  If you can't understand how force is distributed through out a structure during an impact then I can't help you. If both building where hit as high up as this one they wouldn't have fallen, the collapse of the first building caused the remaning damage needed to bring down the second.

       So physics changes with scale?  I would like to know how physics is different on a smaller scale or larger scale.  You are saying the a smaller scale object cannot be tested in a lab environment, which I provided the plane example.  Now you are saying my theory is untestable until we build a life size scale of the WTC towers.  Nice try.

       Yea you're completely misunderstanding how it works.  Buildings aren't solid masses (especially not the WTC buildings, which were more like flat plates with vertical pencils around the edges and in the center supporting the next level) so in this case gravity adds cumulatively.  You have the entire weight of the floors above pushing on the single floor below, because each floor pushes on each floor above and below it.
      </p>

       This fact is what skyscrapers rely on to survive, that each floor can support the cumulative weight of the floors above it.  However, if you weaken the steel supports on one of those floors (say by either introducing burning jet fuel or letting the fire rage uncontrollably for 6 hours) then suddenly it can't support its assigned weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, you wanna test this?  Play a game of Jenga.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you so helpfully pointed out that small scale tests can be useful to indicate realistic expectations, build a Jenga tower
       <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Jenga_tower_with_vertical_pieces.JPG">
        like this
       </a>
       using all vertical or horizontal pieces for each level so that there is a massive air gap in the middle like WTC's design.  Now remove on of the vertical pieces, and you'll see the whole thing come tumbling down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth pointing out:  Small scale
       <em>
        suggests
       </em>
       large scale results.  It doesn't conclusively prove them.  Namely because of the square cube law (mass volume increases faster than height) while the yield, shear, and ultimate strengths of materials stays the same.  This results in what would normally be a very stable situation (like, say, a jenga tower made of wood) rapidly becoming unfeasibly dangerous (which is why we don't build skyscrapers out of wood).

       Unfortunately, the Jenga tower you built should have fallen over the second the planes hit them.  The towers were built stronger then that.  The way you built your Jenga tower is suggesting that taking out an upper column weakens the lower mass.  This is not Newton's third law.   If this holds true, then a Cessna should be able to fly into any tall building and collapse it.  Your Jenga tower is also lacking the central core columns for added support.  Please re-create your Jenga tower with a
       <a href="http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/0112/Eagar/fig3.gif">
        strong central core
       </a>
       , then test it again.

It seems like people across the Atlantic and Pacific have more interest in downvoting this story than the American people do.   Pretty weird.

       According to you my Jenga example is completely acceptable.  You're wrong, because physics is in fact scalar (what with things like F=ma meaning that adding mass with a consistent accelleration results in a superior force and whatnot) but by your own logic my Jenga example disproves you.  So either you're wrong about physics and your hypothesis is still proven wrong, or you're wrong about my small scale's veracity and you're still proven wrong.  Make up your mind.

       "In the following interview clip, which took place inside of the Twin Towers on January 25, 2001, and aired on the 7th Season of the History Channel's Series "Modern Marvels" on June 25, 2001, Frank A. DeMartini, Manager, WTC Construction and Project Management, explains how the Twin Towers were "designed" to withstand the impact of a "fully-loaded Boeing 707." He also goes on to say that each of the Twin Towers would "probably sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door: this
       <strong>
        intense grid
       </strong>
       ; and, the jet plane is just a
       <strong>
        pencil
       </strong>
       puncturing this screen netting;
       <strong>
        it really does nothing to the screen netting.
       </strong>
       "
       <em>
        -ahem, Newton's 3rd Law
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting to note that the planes that slammed into the Twin Towers were Boeing 767s, which have a maximum take-off weight of 300,000 pounds, slightly less than the 330,000-pound maximum of the Boeing 707, making them slightly smaller than the planes the architects designed the Twin Towers to withstand the impacts of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, Frank DeMartini is not available for comment because he perished in the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001."

       The Tube within a Tube WTC didn't have a central core either after the plane went through them.  The core was irrepairably compromised by the airplane impact and the fire weakening the steel.  Hence why they collapsed.  Especially since once you take out one of the lower floors the top floors collapse, taking the lower floors with them.

       Edit:  I'm sitting hitting recycle on this thread.  It is getting 2 downvotes a minute.  For a thread that
       <strong>
        no one
       </strong>
       should be able to see, it sure has enough attention to make it still gets downvotes.  People are going out of their way to find a buried story on page 10 to downvote it.  Seems legit.

       False, the entire bottom structure would offer resistance as a whole unless each floor is severed and acted upon one at a time.  Otherwise, the upward resistance of 88 floors would have stopped the top 15 floors in a rather swift manner.

       If 15 floors fall onto one then it's 16 floors falling onto one, and then 17, and then 18, and then 20 - you see where I'm going?  Gravity helps propel those floors as they fall - it doesn't offer resistance to counter act the falling.

       False, the steel frame is built to support much greater than the weight of an intact upper 15 floors, much less one that has been decimated by a plane crash and jet fuel fire.  The bottom 88 floors would act to push up in unison against the top floors when they fell.  You are just making this up, there is no scientific backing for this argument.  It is a fairy tale.

       That doesn't make any sense.  Each frame is strong enough to support its own floor, once each floor's frame is compromised it fails and the floor collapses.

       You've been trying to force the pancake theory down everyone's throat. The only problem is you need to ignore Newton's 3rd law in order to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       For every action (floor collapsing) there is an equal and opposite reaction (bottom floors resisting).
      </p>
      <p>
       You are ignoring Newton's 3rd law. You ignore the bottom 88 floors and the force they exert as an equal and opposite reaction to the top 15.

       Of course energy is removed from each crushed floor. The point is, more energy is added through the release of gravitational potential energy than is dissipated by the crushing of the structure. That means that once collapse starts, it can't be stopped.

       There was no violation of Newtons third law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a simple logic exercise for you.  Remember, according to Newton, Force = Mass * Acceleration
      </p>
      <p>
       When the uppermost 15 stories of the trade center gave way and started to collapse, the
       <em>
        MASS
       </em>
       was 15 stories worth, and it
       <em>
        ACCELLERATED
       </em>
       to around 19mph before hitting the top intact floor of the bottom portion of the structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, Newton's third law says forces occur in equal and opposite directions.  The amount of force needed to destroy that first intact floor acts in the opposite direction on the falling mass by slowing it down.  That floor doesn't have nearly the strength to
       <em>
        stop
       </em>
       15 stories worth of falling mass, so it can only slow it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once that floor collapses, you now have a
       <em>
        16 story mass
       </em>
       , and it has 12 feet of
       <em>
        nothing but air
       </em>
       to go through before it impacts the second intact floor.  The now
       <em>
        16 story pile of mass
       </em>
       isn't starting from 0mph like when the initial 15 stories collapsed.  It's already moving.  By the time it passes through the 12 feet of air, it is now going
       <em>
        faster
       </em>
       than the initial 15 story pile was.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, knowing that
       <strong>
        Force = Mass * Acceleration
       </strong>
       , what do you think happens as that mass goes through floor by floor?  It GAINS MASS with every floor it collapses, and it
       <em>
        ACCELERATES
       </em>
       every time it passes through the 12 feet of air between floors.  The amount of
       <em>
        FORCE
       </em>
       that pile of mass possesses
       <em>
        INCREASES
       </em>
       as it falls.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is NO violation of Newton's third law.  The energy required to pulverize and collapse each story of the building acts in the opposite direction by slowing the pile down.  The problem is that the trade center is not a tower of bricks.  It's a mostly hollow tube, made up of 88% air which provides no resistance at all.  Any energy expended in slowing the pile of falling mass down is irrelevant, since the pile gets to fall 12 feet unimpeded between each floor and
       <em>
        GAIN VELOCITY
       </em>
       as it falls.

       <p>
        The upper falling section of WTC 1, while it was still identifiable and observable, (before it turned into a dust cloud) was measured and it did not slow down, it accelerated uniformly
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       False.  The structure did not collapse at free fall acceleration, it was 8 or 9 seconds slower, indicating it was meeting resistance and slowing down between floors.  Not nearly enough to arrest the collapse, but enough to safely say the building was providing resistance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's also that little thing called the core of the building with 47 HUGE steel columns, that's not air every 12 feet.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       After the buildings collapsed, portions of the core columns remained standing for 15 seconds for both towers.  40 floors for one tower and 60 floors for another IIRC.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Lots of mass was immediately set outside the perimeter of the tower, or square, if you will and that mass is no longer acting up the rest of the building, it's falling through the air.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The majority of the mass remained in the collapse zone.  You're nitpicking, the fact is that the mass of rubble was
       <em>
        increasing
       </em>
       as the building collapsed.  Who gives a shit if it isn't adding an entire floor worth of mass for each one it collapses, it's still adding a shitload of weight as it falls.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you believe the upper block crushed everything below if then why is there perfectly straight columns showing in the core for a few seconds when most of WTC 1 was on the ground?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because the core columns offered more resistance than the empty floor space did, therefore they remained standing for a few seconds.  All of the empty floor space around them collapsed without much resistance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The great majority of the mass of those buildings turned into powder in midair
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No they didn't.

        Nowhere did I say that it fell at free fall, only that it accelerated uniformly. If it accelerates uniformly and doesn't slow down, it's not impacting what's below, something's removing it.

      <p>
       You don't understand the concept you are talking about, and it shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       The estimate was that the first floor impacted would have slowed the mass down by around half a mile an hour.  Each subsequent floor would have slowed it down even less than that due to the pile of rubble having increased in mass and velocity.  You can't see 99% of what's happening in the trade tower collapses.  All you can see is what's happening to the outer shell.

       <p>
        I mentioned portions of the core still standing, and that that fact gives your piledriver theory a MAJOR problem, why didn't this unstoppable force you speak of crush it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The core columns remained standing because they were essentially a hollow tube in the center of the building.  The massive empty floor space around the core columns was subject to the full force of the rubble bearing down and collapsed almost immediately.

       What did you expect them to do?  The buildings contained a massive amount of cement and drywall, which tends to turn
       <em>
        partially

       to dust when it gets crushed.

       Personally I like to go to both subs and laugh at both sets of you all. Frankly, I think both groups are a little silly-this one for giving credence to almost any conspiracy theory that comes around, no matter how ludicrous, and conspiratard for refusing to acknowledge that there are

       False, the steel frame was weakend from the impact and the fire, maybe not enough to make the whole thing colapse but enough so that when the area that was hit gave way the floors on top crushed the rest.

       I'm sorry, but you're way off here. We aren't talking about the structure being strong enough to support the upper 15 floors. We are talking about whether the structure is strong enough to support the impact load from the upper 15 floors falling 12 feet, which is totally different. As calculated by bazant and Zhou,  the impact force is an order of magnitude greater than what the structure can actually support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, you're not understanding properly how a structure supports load. Having more floors doesn't make the structure any stronger. The columns in this case only fail one or two floors at a time, so this building could have been two hundred stories tall and you would have the same outcome.

       I guess you're having trouble understanding this "gravity" thing. Let's learn some basic physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Force = Mass x Acceleration
      </p>
      <p>
       Noting this, and noting that gravity is a source of acceleration (with no air resistance, mass will accelerate at roughly 9.8 meter per second downwards due to gravity...air resistance is negligible at this point), we have to consider two things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The force acting downward must increase as the mass increases, because greater mass is hitting the floors below...even if debris falls out to the sides, it's not likely to
       <em>
        reduce
       </em>
       the above mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The force acting downward must increase, or at least remain roughly constant, because gravity is accelerating the mass as it falls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, keeping this in mind, let me give you an example. A flat piece of wood falls 10 meters, hitting a flat piece of wood below it (both weigh 1 kg). In order to dislodge the lower flat piece of wood, the upper piece has to hit it with a force of at least 5 Newtons (measure of force). The upper one hits the lower one with a force of 9.8 m/s * 1kg, 9.8 Newtons. It dislodges and falls with the second piece of wood into the next one. Now, the force is no longer 9.8m/s * 1kg, because there's
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       pieces of wood. Now, they hit with 9.8m/s *
       <strong>
        2
       </strong>
       kg, increasing the downward force.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still following here? Cool. Now let's look at the energy side of this, because that's another way to calculate this all. Kinetic energy is calculated by 1/2 * mass * velocity squared. Or we can do this with potential energy, which is mass * gravity (acceleration) * height. Note, by the way, that they both illustrate exactly what is being said above. Each time a floor falls, the same height (roughly, I mean it's not
       <em>
        perfect
       </em>
       engineering) is traveled before they hit the next one. However, there is
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       mass coming down. That means
       <em>
        more energy
       </em>
       . And in both formulas that means
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       energy. And because the velocity in the first formula would be roughly the same (since the acceleration downwards is constant due to gravity, and they go the same distance down while accelerating), there's
       <em>
        no reason
       </em>
       to think they would
       <em>
        lose
       </em>
       energy as they go down. In fact, they should be falling
       <em>
        faster
       </em>
       !
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way, if you don't like the above examples/explanations. You fall off a building, let's say. You are going to fall through a few canvases as you go. You'll slow down, right? Because your mass remains constant, but friction slows you down (we're assuming your legs don't break). This time, we drop a bulldozer down. The canvases have very little effect, right? Because it's got so much more mass, it has
       <em>
        tons
       </em>
       more potential energy, and hits with much more force! Now let's say we drop a bulldozer which latches on to another bulldozer, resting on a canvas. Does the fact that it hit another bulldozer slow it down? Nope, because now they're falling
       <em>
        together
       </em>
       . When they both hit, there will be double the force, because there's double the mass. Sure,
       <em>
        some small amount of energy is lost
       </em>
       when they collide because this isn't a perfect world, and the top bulldozer probably bounces every so slightly upward. But in the case of the falling building, each floor falls only for the slightest fraction of a second, before coming down thunderously on top of another floor that has already exerted its force, and probably hasn't had time to rebound itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very, very basic physics. The more mass is falling, the more force it'll exert when it hits what's below.

       Because you clearly don't even understand Newton's 3rd law shows just how far your ignorance goes in citing very old theories that are the building blocks of physics. Material physics works better here because it's not theoreticals, it's pure calculable mathematics.

       No, your use of Newton's 3rd law is half baked. Youre not taking into account is structural engineering and material physics. Newton's 3rd law only accounts for one variable among many variables.

       So you actually think it's logical to say that 15 floors can pulverize the 88 floors below them and all of their support beams (which were
       <em>
        not

       Even if that is the case, they offer a bit more resistance than what we saw - one of the hugest sky scrapers in the world falling on its own footprints. No pile of floors squished together, smithereens. This is what controlled demolitions aspire to. Yet here we have a weakening of steel due to fire (official cause) and the whole building disappears. Laughable. That being said it was built to withstand a plane crash. That being said multiple explosions reported as well as clear evidence for explosions in the basement. But I digress.

       I'm not saying I'm an expert, I'm saying when the floors fell, they exerted force on the floors below them and the building collapsed and that the OP's "physics" are incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can look up the NIST findings if you want - I did and it says that the center structure was compromised by fire and the damn thing fell.
       <br/>
       Whether you call it "pancaking" or whatever, the result is the same - the building fell down because it was hit by a big plane full of fuel, it caught fire and burned until it became structurally unsound enough to fall.

       Actually, the NIST had this to say about the collapse of WTC 1 and 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Based on its comprehensive investigation, NIST concluded that the WTC towers collapsed because:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) the impact of the planes severed and damaged support columns, dislodged fireproofing insulation coating the steel floor trusses and steel columns, and widely dispersed jet fuel over multiple floors; and
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) the subsequent unusually large number of jet-fuel ignited multi-floor fires (which reached temperatures as high as 1,000 degrees Celsius, or 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit) significantly weakened the floors and columns with dislodged fireproofing to the point where floors sagged and pulled inward on the perimeter columns. This led to the inward bowing of the perimeter columns and failure of the south face of WTC 1 and the east face of WTC 2, initiating the collapse of each of the towers. Both photographic and video evidence—as well as accounts from the New York City Police Department aviation unit during a half-hour period prior to collapse—support this sequence for each tower."

       The other 88 floors were not universally intact. The building got hit by a plane if you can't see how that would weaken the building as a whole then there is no reasoning with you.

       Don't see the reason for the in your own words comment but to each his own. The reason I think this is simple a plane hit the uper part of each building at close to full speed and at somewhat of an angle(not directly head on). When th impact happend it twisted the whole building, not much but more than it was disigned to in the wind. This would cause damage through the whole building not just the floors impacted.

       I have, that example is a horrible one btw, diffrent planes, building type, material, speed and a great many other factors. The fact is no one(at the time they were built) thought someone would fly a airliner jet into the building at those speeds. As such it was not designed for that impact.

       Yeah it wasn't designed to take an impact like it did though. Near full speed and a larger plane than it was designed for. It makes zero sense to think a building getting hit by a plane, even if designed for such an impact, wouldn't take other damage to the structure. Being built to withstand doesn't mean it wouldn't take damage just that it would still be standing to let people evacuate. They would still have to go in and fix said damage or bring it down in CD because it can't be fixed.

        Gravity can only account for a portion of the energy that brought down either WTC1 or WTC2. Debunkers will insist that gravity is the unaccounted for energy source. Which brings us back to debunkers ignoring Newton's 3rd law.

       You're obfuscating again. Let's stick to the simple, easy to understand example I've used.
      </p>
      <p>
       A= top 15 floors of tower
      </p>
      <p>
       B= bottom 88 floors of tower
      </p>
      <p>
       Newton's 3rd law of motion states "in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object (A) equals the size of the force on the second object (B). The direction of the force on the first object (A)is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object (B).
       <strong>
        Forces always come in pairs
       </strong>
       - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs."

       Seriously, you should call the University of UCLA Engineers and give them your Jenga example.  The first thing they will tell you is that your Jenga tower has no central core columns.

       "In the following interview clip, which took place inside of the Twin Towers on January 25, 2001, and aired on the 7th Season of the History Channel's Series "Modern Marvels" on June 25, 2001, Frank A. DeMartini, Manager, WTC Construction and Project Management, explains how the Twin Towers were "designed" to withstand the impact of a "fully-loaded Boeing 707." He also goes on to say that each of the Twin Towers would "probably sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door: this
       <strong>
        intense grid
       </strong>
       ; and, the jet plane is just a
       <strong>
        pencil
       </strong>
       puncturing this screen netting;
       <strong>
        it really does nothing to the screen netting.
       </strong>
       "
       <em>
        -ahem, Newton's 3rd Law
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting to note that the planes that slammed into the Twin Towers were Boeing 767s, which have a maximum take-off weight of 300,000 pounds, slightly less than the 330,000-pound maximum of the Boeing 707, making them slightly smaller than the planes the architects designed the Twin Towers to withstand the impacts of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, Frank DeMartini is not available for comment because he perished in the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001."

       You're ignoring Newton's 1
       <sup>
        st
       </sup>
       Law of motion. It states that a body at rest will stay at rest unless a force acts upon it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the structural integrity of a floor changes (which could happen because, oh I don't know, a plane filled with fuel flew into it and burst into flames heating the metal construction) , it will fail and the upper floors will start to move downwards. When they impact the floor below the one that has just failed, a force will be exerted on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newton's 3
       <sup>
        rd
       </sup>
       Law is all well and good but all three laws should be taken into account as they are a homogenous set
      </p>
      <p>
       In the following example I'm going to be using some actual physics calculations here (Potential Energy formula -
       <em>
        P=mgh
       </em>
       ). If you disagree with them then can I suggest you publish your amended formulae and await your Nobel prize?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll keep the numbers simple so that we can all understand
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a column (built in a similar fashion to WTC 1+2 and not a Jenga pile) that is 100 levels tall. Each level weighs a metric tonne and is a metre high.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine that the structural integrity of level 80 is compromised and fails. In an instant, there is a mass 21 tonnes (21000 kg) in free fall. After falling for 1m, this mass impacts onto level 79 with a kinetic energy of 205.8kJ. Not all energy is conserved as it will be converted into heat, noise etc but it
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       affect the integrity of level 79 and the end result is the failure of level 79 pretty quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       We now have a mass of 22 tonnes falling and impacting level 78. Even if we imagine the mass had come to a complete top and a free-fall of only 1m occurs, 78 would encounter an impact producing 215.6kJ. However, I would imagine that levels 79 to 100 would not stop completely free-falling and so the energy would be higher. Again, some energy will be converted into heat, affect level 78 and fall again. Repeat until levels 2-80 have failed
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time levels 2-100 have collapsed, even if they only impacted level 1 as if they free-fell 1m, the energy produced would be 1455.3kJ. Once floor 1 collapses, levels 2-99 are still falling. Once the mass of levels 2-80 is at ground level, levels 81-100 would the give way due to the shockwave going back up through the tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each floor is only designed to support (repel) the energy produced by mass bearing down on it (with some tolerance). This energy is dispersed into the surrounding structure. When half the structure of a few floors has been removed (by, possibly, a place flying into it and exploding), the energy is forced into the remaining structure and the remaining tolerance is lowered. The kinetic energy of a mass falling onto it (
       <em>
        K=0.5mv
        <sup>
         2
        </sup>
       </em>
       ) means that that tolerance is exceeded and a failure is an almost certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the bit about putting a bowling ball on top of a model Empire State Building and it not falling? Seriously? What if you remove a load-bearing beam of the model (which I would guess
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       happen at WTC 1+2 because, hmm, let's think...a plane flying into it?). Would you expect the bowling ball to still be supported? I'm guessing no

       I'm not debunking anything. I'm pointing out that you've taken a well known and accepted set of law of motion, ignored the bits that don't fit your theory, warped the rest of it and come up with something that wouldn't look out of place in a sci-fi novel (albeit a terrible one).

       Hmmm I actually do a physics degree so I'll try my best to explain how this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the building in its equilibrium state. The top block floors exert a force vector W on the floor beneath it. This floor exerts a reaction force N back on the top floors. There is no net force on the top floors. The building does not collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now consider the damaged building. Suddenly the reaction force N is less than W much like how a jenga tower with no bottom block no longer has the reaction force of the table to stop it falling. There still is an equal and opposite reaction but it is the building pulling the earth towards it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since W &gt; N the floor has an acceleration, picks up momentum, impacts the next floor, exerts a large impulse, causes the collapse of the next floor etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way you're phrasing it you would wonder how any object can ever fall.

       He will never consider even for a moment that his argument is invalid, because it supports his prior conviction about 9/11. He'll just keep repeating the same meaningless mantra. He's not interested in what is true, and I'm pretty sure that the number of people trying to argue with him only solidifies his beliefs.

       You'd think an actual physicist wouldn't keep coming at me with the pancake theory, but here we are, discussing your pancake theory.

       Your authority as a physicist is laughable, if for no other reason than you just negated Newton's 3rd law in order to say that pancaking caused 15 floors to demolish 88 floors.

       I'm actually curious if you think anything small can wreck anything larger than itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can a wrecking ball smash a building which is larger than itself? If I drop a playing card on top of a playing card house, must it always stand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say you build a domino tower 99 stories tall and let me knock down the top 11 into the bottom 88, you think they can't come down because there are more of them?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, how do my examples differ from yours?

       I thought a physicist would stick to the topic at hand (15 vs. 88) but I see you aren't very good at demonstrating where the massive amount of energy comes from to pulverize 88 with 15.

       As a curious bystander, the only question that matters (stop trying to ignore the twin towers, because that's the example I'm using) is "How does Newton's 3rd law negate the pancake theory?"
      </p>
      <p>
       When you figure out that 15 can't pulverize 88, then the next question you must ask is "Where did the energy come from to crush 88 floors?"

       The answer leads back to controlled demolition every time.

       It's not about whether my basic physics arguments hold up for the actual building collapse as I am no structural engineer but what I can tell you is that your grasp on physics is totally incorrect. Start with the basics and work upwards because it's clear that there are some gaps in your understanding of Newton's laws.

       The progressive collapse is the same idea as the pancake theory, it's just a different dressing for the same bullshit narrative that can't hold up to Newton's 3rd law of motion, which states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A progressive collapse defies Newton's 3rd law quite obviously, from the idea that:
      </p>
      <p>
       88 is pushing back on 15
      </p>
      <p>
       Newton's law in it's basic form. It's untouchable. Which is why debunkers keep peddling out the progressive pancaking theory, which our government couldn't rightfully offer us, because, progressive collapses defy the laws of Newton's 3rd law.

       Sorry to bump in here but just to clarify for the arguments sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an opposite equal force pushing against your finger it's just that the Force = M*a and since your mass is so much larger than the key you experience a neglible acceleration most likely cancelled out by friction forces. The key experiences the force of your finger and without a reaction force beneath it experiences a much greater acceleration and hence velocity due to its small mass.

       We aren't talking about keyboards. Nice attempt at obfuscation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are talking about 88 bottom floors and 15 top floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       15 can't pile drive 88 to the ground.

       Your time would be better spent looking for the magical energy source that ripped 88 stories worth of 47 main steel columns to the ground in roughly 12-13 seconds.

       I know we're not talking about keyboards. I'm not stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know what? I'm through with people like you who see a phrase in a high-school book, ignore the actual science behind it and use it (incorrectly) as the basis for a whole theory. And then, when people eminently more qualified than yourself come along and say "You're talking rubbish" you just say "You're a classic debunker! You're a fool! I'm the one you should all be listening to". You can't get it into your head that someone may actually know more than you about a subject (in this case, physics)
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, what's your qualifications regarding physics? Degree? Masters? Doctorate? Professor? Or is it, as I suspect, 1st grade high-school?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people on here with degrees. There are people on here with years of engineering experience. There are people with a basic understanding of energy, force and the conservation thereof. They all have something in common - they all know you're wrong. Actually, let me correct that - they all know you're
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       wrong
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, tell me (without referring to penty1's explanation of force) how you believe it is possible for me to push a key on my  keyboard without violating your version of Newton's 3
       <sup>
        rd
       </sup>
       law. I need a good laugh

       Picture this, the floors are all connected to eachother, they're not just a bunch of separate pieces stacked on top of one another. There are supports running all the way up through the building at one point or another, so when something crashes into the top, it pulls on supports that run all the way through the building. It's pretty silly to suggest a freaking plane crashing into the top of a building doesn't have any effect on the bottom. The bottom line is theirs a lot of factors that we can't account for because we didn't build those buildings. You're setting up the situation in a vacuum, but it doesn't really hold up when you think about it.

       No, but when a building collapses, its potential kinetic energy is converted in several ways. One of those ways is sound and heat.

        Forces always come in pairs. How does this pertain to the demolition of both WTC1 and WTC2? Let's set up a simple example:
       </p>
       <p>
        A= top 15 floors of tower
       </p>
       <p>
        B= bottom 88 floors of tower
       </p>
       <p>
        Newton's 3rd law of motion states "in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object (A) equals the size of the force on the second object (B). The direction of the force on the first object (A)is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object (B). Forces always come in pairs - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs."
The logical next step is to find the unaccounted for energy source for the remainder of the collapse sequence.
Gravity can only account for a portion of the energy that brought down either WTC1 or WTC2. Debunkers will insist that gravity is the unaccounted for energy source. Which brings us back to debunkers ignoring Newton's 3rd law.

        I link to a paper from actual physicists where they discuss the physics involved

       . Note that the physics isn't that complex and it doesn't violate the 3rd law at all.

       Bazant's equations assume that all the mass of Part A is incrementally added to that of Part C as the collapse works its way down.
      </p>
      <p>
       if it weren't already obvious, some of the mass of Part A and/or Part C is ejected horizontally out of play and cannot be part of the mass that is crushing Part A. In addition, the horizontal momentum represents energy that Bazant erroneously counted in the downward force in his equations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, you can see that portions of Part A remain standing after the collapse zone has passed well below them. In frame 17:08:15 you can see columns still standing when the collapse zone has moved quite a ways below them. There is also a significant chunk of structure that remains well above the collapse zone in frames 21:10:15 through 24:12:00 and then drops out of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the mass that was ejected horizontally out of play and all of the mass that remained standing above the progressing collapse zone represent undeniable error in Bazant's equations. This mass cannot be part of the mass that is (allegedly) crushing Part A as Bazant's formulas assume. All of the horizontal momentum represents energy that Bazant erroneously counted as part of the crushing force.

       .. accounts for minimal mass. The dust is 200 micron sized particles being ejected as a cloud. The cloud has minimal mass and therefore is both a minimal loss of mass and a minimal loss of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top 15 floors would have to lose

        most

       much
       <em>
        more

Gravity can only account for a portion of the energy that brought down either WTC1 or WTC2. Debunkers will insist that gravity is the unaccounted for energy source. Which brings us back to debunkers ignoring Newton's 3rd law.

       Basically every comment to you is pointing out it's flaws, it's unfounded assumptions, and how it is wrong in every possible way. Fundamentally your model is wrong - you're treating the buildings as solid objects.

       Seeing as I've commented on this paper before - and it repeats the same
       <em>
        fundamentally wrong
       </em>
       assertion that the lower 88 floors should be treated as if they are a solid mass - there is nothing it adds to the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put - it's math is perfectly sound and valid
       <strong>
        if
       </strong>
       it's premise was true. However as it is not then the math is based on an incorrect model so no matter how much math they have they are incorrect from the get go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again - this has been explained to you
       <strong>
        repeatedly
       </strong>
       : if the lower 88 floors were a solid mass then you (and this paper) would be correct. As they
       <em>
        were not
       </em>
       then you  (and this paper)  aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason this paper has never been submitted to peer review - it wouldn't hold up at all.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In other words, as long as the falling block is accelerating downward we have the counter-intuitive result that the force it exerts on the lower section of the building is significantly less than its static weight. It is difficult to imagine how an upper block exerting a force of only 36% of its static weight could crush the larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building to the ground, when the building, at any level, was designed to support several times the weight above it. Assuming a safety factor of between 3 and 5 [12], the observed acceleration implies that close to 90% of the strength of the lower section of the building must have been eliminated by forces other than the supposed "pile driver," suggesting that some sort of controlled demolition was at work.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       None of that is true
       <em>
        unless the entire lower 88 are modeled as a solid mass
       </em>
       . The percentages specifically doing that. That is in fact what the whole "pile driver" phrase means. It is specifically treating the "larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building" as being modeled as a solid object for the purposes of their mathematics - else none of the rest of it's work makes even the most remote of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        IF

       that was true then I'd agree with you completely. It's not though.

       Nice try OP, physics actually does support why the towers collapsed and not this mumbo-jumbo. Say the 88th floor burnt and allowed the 15 floors above it to collapse, these upper 15 floors then pulverized the remains of the 88th and then went on to the 87th, 86th and so on. All the upper part of the tower needed to do was crush the floor below it, the increasing velocity and added mass as the floors collapsed allowed the destruction to continue and utterly destroy both towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't buy that, here's the equation for kinetic energy: KE=.5mv
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       As you can see as the mass and velocity increase the kinetic energy increases, none of the floors were built to withstand thousands of tons of material falling on them at a few hundred miles an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Newton's 3rd Law, it's only applicable in the case you used it when the towers weren't collapsing, once the collapse started velocity came into play (see above) and the equal and opposing forces of the 88 lower floors pushing up and the 15 upper floors pushing down became unequal.

       For every action (top 15 floor collapsing) there is an equal and opposite reaction (bottom 88 floors resisting).

       And just like every other debunker in this thread, you're touting the impossible pancake theory. Newton's 3rd law doesn't allow 15 floors to pulverize the bottom 88 floors and the 47 steel beams that made up the interior of the WTC 1 and 2 complexes.

       No, there is no equal and opposite reaction from the lower floors, the normal force from the bottom is no longer equal to the force of gravity from the top. Newton's third law doesn't work the way you're trying to make it, once the upper 15 floors start on the way down gravity accelerates them 9.8 meters per second every second which gives more than enough kinetic energy to pulverize floor after successive floor. Unless you think that a floor made of mostly empty space, dry wall partitions, concrete and a relatively light exterior with some tube framing can support itself as well as another 15 of itself stacked on top after being subjected to a fire burning at up to 4000 degrees F, but nobody's that stupid are they?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the steel beams, beams like those aren't designed to stand on their own, once the support provided by the exterior walls and tower was gone the beams would fall too.

       Without looking at the comments, there appears to be a simple flaw in the logic of the OP's simplistic "formula". The bottom floors held up the top floors against gravity before, so they should have held after... unless sabotage and "inside job".  The bottom 88 floors held up the top 15 under 1g; but as soon as the fire melted the supports and collapse started, the equation changed to 15 floors at 1g,
       <strong>
        plus acceleration
       </strong>
       (the unaccounted-for energy).

       You've just negated Newton's 3rd law. The bottom 88 floors will slow down the "acceleration" according to Newton's 3rd law.

       See, this is where you are completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You assume the the bottom 88 floors would slow down the acceleration and stop collapse, but you can't know that without a detailed analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to look at two things, energy input and energy output. In this case, the energy input is the gravitational potential energy of the structure, which is continually released in the form of kinetic energy as the building falls. This means, you have a continuous input of energy for as long as the building is falling. I believe this is your missing energy that you mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The energy output is caused by the crushing of the structure. It dissipates the kinetic energy by transferring it into strain energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, as is probably intuitive, if kinetic energy is being input into the system by gravity faster than it is being removed by the crushing of the structure, than the collapse with progress all the way to the ground. If not, than it slows down and stops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, the issue is much more complicated than you think and you need to prove that energy output was greater than energy input before you can actually prove that collapse was impossible. So I'll just wait patiently for your next post where you do those calcs.

       You do not have a continuous input of energy because the bottom 88 floors with the 47 core columns and the steel outer frames would have pushed with equal and OPPOSITE force against the top 15.

       Wow! I just understood what you are saying. I kept thinking that I was missing something, but now I realize that you just lack the most basic understanding of Newtons laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think that because the bottom part of the tower pushes back with an equal and opposite force that these two forces cancel each other out and that no collapse can happen. That must be what you think because that's the only thing that makes sense. Let me describe how ridiculous that is with another example.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I have an egg and a brick. I put the egg on the ground and drop the brick on top of it. What happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, according to your interpretation of Newtons 3rd law, that egg pushes back with an equal and opposite force to what the brick impacts it with. Therefore these forces cancel each other out and the brick comes to a nice rest on top of the egg. And don't you dare ignore Newtons 3rd law and tell me that egg gets crushed!!
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously, I hope you see that you are wrong now.

       You're right that the bottom floors push on the top floors with an equal and opposite force. So why does that mean that the force that's applied is not enough to crush the bottom part of the building.

       Ridiculous reply. This is certainly worth answering with a bit more intelligence than what you have offered. A domino is completely free standing and independent of any force horizontally, thus you can push it over with ease. Each floor is fundamentally connected to the whole structure whilst it is standing.

       For example, jenga blocks won't break when they fall, a skyscraper's structure will.

       Comparing jenga blocks to a modern steel frame tower is laughable, at best.  88 floors of steel will not break just because the remainder of 15 floors, horribly damaged by the attack, acts on it with a mild gravity energy.  Your arguments are flawed and your unwillingness to argue with science, rather than conjecture, only serves to obfuscate the facts.  You were lied to, by government and scientists that are all pretty well off now since this happened (it's called a pay-off).

       Agreed, The only reason I brought up jenga was because of his equally laughable analogy about dominoes standing on their ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a poor choice, but I'd still like to hear how this guy sees dominoes standing on end beside eachother as an analogy to a building collapse.

       Ok I can concede to that, but how are dominoes stacked on end, falling into eachother anologous to what happened on 9/11? There is almost no resistence when pushing over a domino stacked on its thin edge. A building is designed specifically to resist the force of gravity, so the two things are nowhere near similar.

       Yes and the question was made in context of an analogy presented by the poster above. If you're just here to pick out details and not see what we're discussing in context then your contribution does not help anyone here get closer to the truth.
      </p>

       Again, it was a poor choice of analogy but it's still far better than comparing a building to dominoes standing on end beside eachother.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Once the collapse had begun, the propagation of the collapse was readily explained without the same complexity of modeling.

      <p>
       In other words - it wasn't required to model the progressive collapse because it had been done to death and is well understood. NISTs purpose was to show us how to get to that point. Once it's
       <strong>
        at
       </strong>
       that point progressive collapse is a simple fact.

       The arguments people use to deny the science behind this is laughable, at best.  Add in the fact that they ridicule and make outrageous demands for proof (build it to scale and recreate it?

       This a really great way to approach it.  You can't debunk physics.  Try to visualize the towers as a stack of bricks.  Whatever happens(plane crashing into) on the upper mass of the bricks, cannot effect the lower part.   So even if the upper mass is on fire, it cannot crush its way all the way to the bottom bricks without adding
       <strong>
        energy
       </strong>
       to the system.  Newton's third law prevents this.  People can recreate this experiment all the want in their backyards.  Take 10 bricks, then take the top 2.  Then try dropping the 2 onto the bottom 8 bricks.  Do they crush their way alll the way to the bottom at free-fall speed?  Nope.  Good post.

       But there is energy. Its called gravitational potential energy (U(potential)=mass x acceleration due to gravity x height) , and once motion begins it becomes kinetic (T(Kinetic energy= .5 mass *velocity
       <sup>
        2).
       </sup>
       Once its kinetic, its not just about forces, its about momentum (mass x velocity) and impulse, and conservation of said momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
       The brick analogy is both wrong and right at the same time. If you put a scale on the bottom, you would notice a change in impulse because of a transference of force because its a full rigid body (the same way newton's cradle works).  A tower that is mostly hollow is not a rigid body in the same way and if the forces aren't aligned right on the supports it would lead to collapse. Instead of clay bricks, pretend it was a jenga set after people have been playing a while. Now what happens when you drop those bricks hard on the top?

       All large buildings are designed to implode during a controlled demolition. This makes them safer and easier to bring down when they've outlived their usefulness. You can search YouTube and find numerous videos of this in action, most especially with some old Las Vegas hotels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because large buildings are designed to implode during controlled demolition, it seems to me (would be interesting for physicists and architects to confirm) that they would be more likely to implode in the same manner due to other traumas they might suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way the towers fell coupled with the fact they were designed to implode at the end of their lives doesn't necessarily indicate it was controlled demolition on 9/11. Nor does it indicate that it was not.
      </p>
      <p>
       It simply means that they were designed in such a way that you cannot possibly design your stack-of-bricks experiment so the stack-of-bricks experiment is irrelevant to the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       What might be interesting would be to find a skyscraper that has outlived its usefulness that was built in roughly the same manner and at roughly the same time as the WTC, then fully load a big, remote controlled jet with jet fuel and fly that fucker into high floors and see what happens.

       To me the leap of logic that if a building is designed to fall into itself
       <em>
        during a controlled demolition
       </em>
       then it must fall that way from random damage makes no sense.
If it's true that they are intended to fall this way during a controlled demolition then what happened on 9/11 looks like a controlled demolition to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you can back the statement that they would fall this way from random damage with some proof I think what you're saying actually supports the idea that the buildings were demo'd that day.
      </p>

       After all, demoing a building is a huge undertaking. If buildings are just deisgned to fall that way from random damage why is building demolition such an exact science?

       To avoid the collateral damage that the WTC falling caused, for one.

       <p>
        what happened on 9/11 looks like a controlled demolition to me

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, the buildings falling look a lot like what would have happened during a controlled demolition. And controlled demolition could be a plausible explanation for what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equally plausible is that the impact of a 395,000 pound jet traveling at hundreds of miles per hour combined with a fire burning jet fuel weakened the structure on one floor enough that it could no longer support the combined weight of all the floors on top if it, and that one floor collapsed.  When that one floor collapsed, all that weight and energy hit the next floor down, which did a perfectly fine job of holding all the floors on top of it, but couldn't with the added energy of them under free fall, so it collapsed. And so on, like dominoes, straight down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The experiment I proposed would be interesting. If we could see just one other building designed in a similar way and built with similar materials at roughly the same time as the WTC take a jet full of fuel to its top floors, we'd know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to my knowledge the only time it has ever happened (with a jet / jet fuel) was WTC.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm on the "jury's still out" side on 9/11. I feel it's plausible that TPTB were up to no good, to a greater or lesser degree. I think it's far more likely that the conspiracy was to get the terrorists to attack and leave it at that than to go to the full lengths of a controlled demolition on the towers. The latter wouldn't be needed to achieve the desired result - a new war to fill the pockets of the wealthy / military-industrial complex.

       What? Energy is transferred over the entire mass. A fucking plane hit the building in it's side for christ's sake. It doesn't just stop at the halfway mark. Saying that the energy wouldn't be spread over the building "just cause" is a ludicrous argument.

       Light the upper 20% on fire with lighter fluid.  Does the steel frame below allow for the part on fire to crush its way to the ground?  No.  The forces are the same.  You can even attach a bowling ball on-top of the structure.  Light the upper 20% on fire again.  Does the bowling ball crush its way to the bottom?  No.  If anything, the forces on the bottom 80% would deflect the bowling ball off the to side.  It would NEVER fall at free-fall speed straight down with the 80% lower forces in place.

       Are you familiar with scaling relations? If you scale that erector set up to the size of the actual Empire State Building, it would be under a lot more stress. This is because mass increases as the cube of the scale factor.
      </p>

       It's the same reason why an insect can lift many times its own weight, but if you scaled them up their legs would snap under their own weight.

       Heh. You have no idea what you are saying. Things do not scale evenly. An ant could not support it's own weight were it the size of an elephant. As surface area doubles, volume quadruples. Do you understand why that makes scaling up or down problematic?

       So physics changes with scale?  I would like to know how physics is different on a smaller scale or larger scale.  You are saying the a smaller scale object cannot be tested in a lab environment, which I provided the plane example.  Now you are saying my theory is untestable until we build a life size scale of the WTC towers.  Nice try.

       Could those be scaled down models of buildings for structural engineering analysis?  You should call the University of UCLA and tell their Engineers that testing building structures on a smaller scale is pointless.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The upper falling section of WTC 1, while it was still identifiable and observable, (before it turned into a dust cloud) was measured and it did not slow down, it accelerated uniformly
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       False.  The structure did not collapse at free fall acceleration, it was 8 or 9 seconds slower, indicating it was meeting resistance and slowing down between floors.  Not nearly enough to arrest the collapse, but enough to safely say the building was providing resistance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's also that little thing called the core of the building with 47 HUGE steel columns, that's not air every 12 feet.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       After the buildings collapsed, portions of the core columns remained standing for 15 seconds for both towers.  40 floors for one tower and 60 floors for another IIRC.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Lots of mass was immediately set outside the perimeter of the tower, or square, if you will and that mass is no longer acting up the rest of the building, it's falling through the air.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The majority of the mass remained in the collapse zone.  You're nitpicking, the fact is that the mass of rubble was
       <em>
        increasing
       </em>
       as the building collapsed.  Who gives a shit if it isn't adding an entire floor worth of mass for each one it collapses, it's still adding a shitload of weight as it falls.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you believe the upper block crushed everything below if then why is there perfectly straight columns showing in the core for a few seconds when most of WTC 1 was on the ground?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because the core columns offered more resistance than the empty floor space did, therefore they remained standing for a few seconds.  All of the empty floor space around them collapsed without much resistance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        The great majority of the mass of those buildings turned into powder in midair

       Debunkers always love to use NIST to tell us how the building fell but the debunkers always negate to tell us how NIST didn't study the collapse beyond initiation.

       I said that again, let's see how you reply.

       I've heard you say that before, yet I've seen no refutation of my easy to understand example. Let me put it up again, so you can ignore it once more, sound good? And this time, copy and paste your refutation of my easy to understand example, you know, since you've used my example to prove me wrong previously...???

        Forces always come in pairs. How does this pertain to the demolition of both WTC1 and WTC2? Let's set up a simple example:
       </p>
       <p>
        A= top 15 floors of tower
       </p>
       <p>
        B= bottom 88 floors of tower
       </p>
       <p>
        Newton's 3rd law of motion states "in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object (A) equals the size of the force on the second object (B). The direction of the force on the first object (A)is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object (B). Forces always come in pairs - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs." The logical next step is to find the unaccounted for energy source for the remainder of the collapse sequence. Gravity can only account for a portion of the energy that brought down either WTC1 or WTC2. Debunkers will insist that gravity is the unaccounted for energy source. Which brings us back to debunkers ignoring Newton's 3rd law.
