        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I often see people here accusing others of being shills, often based on comments that buck the overall view of the sub. I totally agree that some people come simply to disrupt, and it&#39;s not really my place or intention to comment on how the mods run this sub. It&#39;s theirs, and theirs rules are what they feel they need to be to maintain order.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t see (or at least haven&#39;t seen), and would like to discuss, is the possibility that shills are here, enthusiastically supporting the most outlandish theories circulating, so as to diminish the perceived legitimacy of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the eyes of reddit as a whole, which quite effectively stifles <em>&quot;THEORIES&quot;</em> highlighted on this sub that are real and should be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Sorry to say it, but, cheap karma is available in virtually any sub on reddit- All you have to do is comment &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot; after the most foolish, racist, or otherwise putrid shit people come up with and le upboats come. Worse still, comment <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> after shit that really matters, and the result is exactly the same. </p>

<p>That, my friends, is kinda fucked up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to link examples, or call out any users here by name, but there have been too many times I&#39;ve seen reasonable people and questions attacked with accusations and ad hominems, <em>not</em> to have my suspicion aroused. It&#39;s like some people are <em>purposely</em> trying to make the sub look bad by being assholes to &#39;normals&#39; who happen along.</p>

<p>I recognize and appreciate that there are plenty of people who DO NOT attack, who will take the time to explain or discuss whatever issue comes up like adults. If that&#39;s you, I say thanks, and please accept my sincere apology if you feel I&#39;m somehow accusing you. </p>

<p>I&#39;d appreciate any responses, even if they are to tell me that I myself must be a shill for bringing this up...</p>

<p>People like that led me to create my new sub <a href="/r/conspiracycrossfire">/r/conspiracycrossfire</a>.  It&#39;s a bridge I&#39;m attempting to build between the two communities which I find are often disgusted with themselves.  Beyond that, each sub tries to paint a caricature of the other, and I think a better mutual understanding couldn&#39;t possibly hurt.</p>

<p>Stop on by, I&#39;ve only just started so it&#39;s almost entirely submissions by me over the past few days.  Feel free to change that.</p>

<p>Remind me where the employees of GCHQ who would be involved in a program like JTRIG get their money from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still there&#39;s a finite amount of resources available to any project. I can certainly see the benefit of using the internet for PR, but I can&#39;t see what the possible benefit of paying people to chat with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers is. Especially when those viewpoints are just going to be downvoted anyway. If I were a conspiracy planner, I&#39;d rather those resources be spent on catering, or something tangibly useful to the furthering of my conspiring. Not paying people to piss into the wind. </p>

<p>Meh, its a negligible cost really. If there exists apps that allow even 50 accounts to one agent, and you have a team of 20, that&#39;s 1000 random accounts assumed to be individual.</p>

<p>Even if that team assigned 5 people to reddit for whatever the reason,  its still 250 accounts here able to detract, misinform, perhaps even mod a sub. Shit, you can go one step further and ask &quot;why couldn&#39;t an admin account be &#39;compromised&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p>And why? Why? Well, that honestly is the $64,000 question. But they themselves state:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Threat_Research_Intelligence_Group">&quot;TRIG&#39;s mission includes using &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to “destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt” enemies by “discrediting” them, planting misinformation and shutting down their communications.[2][3] Known as &quot;Effects&quot; operations, the work of JTRIG had become a &quot;major part&quot; of GCHQ&#39;s operations by 2010.[2] The slides also disclose the deployment of &quot;honey traps&quot; of a sexual nature by British intelligence agents.[2]&quot;</a></p>

<p>The things we discuss take some critical thinking and setting aside pre-conceived notions which is very difficult for a lot of people.
For most people it&#39;s easier to join in on the hatred than to actually try and understand what people here are doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is also the reverse problem of completely normal subscribers who try to contribute when they can to this sub and simply because they may disagree with a theory or two they get called a shill just for arguing differently.  I thought this sub was about discussion of conspiracy THEORIES not getting pissy because someone disagrees.  I too though will admit I&#39;ve seen some people in other subs that are definitely paid shills and I&#39;ve seen what I will call troll shills who do it for the upvotes.  Reddit as a whole has both these problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I am starting to see this side of the sub more often. SH and Boston are two sacred subjects and if you even suggest that they might have been legit tragedies you get jumped on.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think they were 100% legit but for example I have not seen a shred of legitimate evidence to suggest that the boston thing used actors. There are a lot of weird things you can point out in pictures but nothing that actually rises to the level of true evidence.

<p>This is the problem the OP was talking about. I think that video is fairly compelling but there is no smoking gun and nothing that can be considered hard evidence. </p>

<p>The &quot;strap system&quot; can be explained by the fact that many people were wearing lanyards that day and the first thing you&#39;re supposed to do when someone has an injury like that is apply a tourniquet.</p>

<p>Other things like the misapplication of the right prosthetic. You can google pictures of Jeff Bauman and see his right leg on that day and it looks fairly convincing. If it was not applied correctly I think you&#39;d be able to see his stump. </p>

<p>On the other hand there are very few pictures of his right leg, almost every other picture shows his left leg clearly and the right is obscured in some way. To me this lends credence to the theory that he was an actor.</p>

<p>Hopefully you can see that people can be on the fence or even disagree with you without being shills or &quot;blue-pills&quot;. </p>

<p>Why decide on something that you can&#39;t really know? We don&#39;t have all the data and it&#39;s foolish to make up your mind at this point.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is absolutely true and another reason why making up your mind on SH is a bad idea. There are so many redacted photos and videos that it&#39;s impossible to know what went on there that day. All I know is that I have not seen hard evidence that Adam Lanza was there that day. </p>

<p>it is irrefutable. believe your eyes or deny. if you or others have not done the work needed to know about the hoody crouch photo and the other photo with the straps on his head whose fault is that? it doesn&#39;t change the facts.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook is not possible to be 100% but Boston it absolutely is.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook there are just too many blanks. Still nothing wrong with theorising about what those blanks may contain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the mods can&#39;t be everywhere but damn they honestly from my point of view don&#39;t really care if a well known submitter calls people shills.  They just slap them on the wrist.  I get called a shill all the freakin time and honestly it happens more than it doesn&#39;t from what I&#39;ve seen.  This is why I don&#39;t really like commenting here.  I just go to some of the smaller more well maintained subs about conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually kinda funny.  In this sub I&#39;m called a shill a lot because I don&#39;t always agree with the posts.  A lot of them I don&#39;t agree with and think they are pretty debunkable and if they are I comment on why I don&#39;t agree with the post.  Inside this sub I get labeled a shill.  However, the other day I was debating something in another sub with somebody and their &quot;trump card&quot; on me was saying: &quot;This coming from a guy who vists <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.&quot;  This was their way of saying that nothing I say is credible because I go on this sub.  If he took the time to read my comments here he would see that I&#39;m usually discrediting claims that are silly, but nevertheless just the fact that I comment here makes me seem not credible to people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t understand the implication of shill. Shill is like a troll who is being paid. A shill or a troll isn&#39;t just someone who argues the other side, they are someone who argues the side that they don&#39;t actually believe.</p>

<p>For a troll they do it for the laughs, for a shill they would have some vested motive.</p>

<p>People need to settle down with the shill thing. I think most people here are either trolls or legitimately believe the stuff they are saying even if they haven&#39;t spent enough time studying the topic to make this evident. </p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely wrong about this and I resent the implication. If you don&#39;t know enough about Sandy Hook and the Boston Bombings to see they were hoaxes, fine, but if you want to tar those who have a better understanding than you do, as &quot;provocateurs&quot;, then I have a problem with that. </p>
