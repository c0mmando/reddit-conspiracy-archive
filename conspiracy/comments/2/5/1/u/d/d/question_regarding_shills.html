       I often see people here accusing others of being shills, often based on comments that buck the overall view of the sub. I totally agree that some people come simply to disrupt, and it's not really my place or intention to comment on how the mods run this sub. It's theirs, and theirs rules are what they feel they need to be to maintain order.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't see (or at least haven't seen), and would like to discuss, is the possibility that shills are here, enthusiastically supporting the most outlandish theories circulating, so as to diminish the perceived legitimacy of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       in the eyes of reddit as a whole, which quite effectively stifles
       <em>
        "THEORIES"
       </em>
       highlighted on this sub that are real and should be taken seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to say it, but, cheap karma is available in virtually any sub on reddit- All you have to do is comment "
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       " after the most foolish, racist, or otherwise putrid shit people come up with and le upboats come. Worse still, comment
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       after shit that really matters, and the result is exactly the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, my friends, is kinda fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to link examples, or call out any users here by name, but there have been too many times I've seen reasonable people and questions attacked with accusations and ad hominems,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to have my suspicion aroused. It's like some people are
       <em>
        purposely
       </em>
       trying to make the sub look bad by being assholes to 'normals' who happen along.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recognize and appreciate that there are plenty of people who DO NOT attack, who will take the time to explain or discuss whatever issue comes up like adults. If that's you, I say thanks, and please accept my sincere apology if you feel I'm somehow accusing you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd appreciate any responses, even if they are to tell me that I myself must be a shill for bringing this up...

       Yes. Detractors, misinformers, disinformers, likely government contractors, bots, shell accounts from projects like JTRIG, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the very fact in-and-of-itself that JTRIG even exists, to me, discounts the honesty of the entire systems of FaceBook, Reddit, and most other social media outlets.

       What would be the benefit of spending time and money to shout into an echo chamber, just to get downvoted? No offense, but if I were a conspiracy planner I'd consider hanging around talking to you guys to be the utmost waste of my time.

       Today's a slow day at work, so I have some time to kill on my phone. I find the logical leaps and bounds that happen in this subreddit to be fascinating, so I enjoy interacting to better understand what makes it all tick. Don't interpret it as malice, I'm sure you're all great people on the other side of the monitor.

       Sorry you had to deal with traubster, guys like him are so dead set in their beliefs you can't really help it; heck, if you were a troll I would find you quite well fed after such a discussion with him.  Makes you wonder what
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       intentions are for engaging you ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       People like that led me to create my new sub
       <a href="/r/conspiracycrossfire">
        /r/conspiracycrossfire
       </a>
       .  It's a bridge I'm attempting to build between the two communities which I find are often disgusted with themselves.  Beyond that, each sub tries to paint a caricature of the other, and I think a better mutual understanding couldn't possibly hurt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop on by, I've only just started so it's almost entirely submissions by me over the past few days.  Feel free to change that.

       Remind me where the employees of GCHQ who would be involved in a program like JTRIG get their money from?

       When you do not have to provide a product for a paying customer, only provide a reason for your existence, spending money that is not yours becomes very close to zero burden.

       Still there's a finite amount of resources available to any project. I can certainly see the benefit of using the internet for PR, but I can't see what the possible benefit of paying people to chat with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       subscribers is. Especially when those viewpoints are just going to be downvoted anyway. If I were a conspiracy planner, I'd rather those resources be spent on catering, or something tangibly useful to the furthering of my conspiring. Not paying people to piss into the wind.

       Meh, its a negligible cost really. If there exists apps that allow even 50 accounts to one agent, and you have a team of 20, that's 1000 random accounts assumed to be individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if that team assigned 5 people to reddit for whatever the reason,  its still 250 accounts here able to detract, misinform, perhaps even mod a sub. Shit, you can go one step further and ask "why couldn't an admin account be 'compromised'?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And why? Why? Well, that honestly is the $64,000 question. But they themselves state:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Threat_Research_Intelligence_Group">
        "TRIG's mission includes using "dirty tricks" to “destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt” enemies by “discrediting” them, planting misinformation and shutting down their communications.[2][3] Known as "Effects" operations, the work of JTRIG had become a "major part" of GCHQ's operations by 2010.[2] The slides also disclose the deployment of "honey traps" of a sexual nature by British intelligence agents.[2]"

       I think that part of it is that it's just an easy bandwagon to get on. Hey look these guys are crazy, everything they say is crazy let's all laugh at them!
      </p>
      <p>
       The things we discuss take some critical thinking and setting aside pre-conceived notions which is very difficult for a lot of people.
For most people it's easier to join in on the hatred than to actually try and understand what people here are doing.

       You can see this all over reddit every day. There will be a topic that hits front page that claims something and all of a sudden you will see it repeated all over reddit. It becomes lore and everyone jumps on the bandwagon.

       There is also the reverse problem of completely normal subscribers who try to contribute when they can to this sub and simply because they may disagree with a theory or two they get called a shill just for arguing differently.  I thought this sub was about discussion of conspiracy THEORIES not getting pissy because someone disagrees.  I too though will admit I've seen some people in other subs that are definitely paid shills and I've seen what I will call troll shills who do it for the upvotes.  Reddit as a whole has both these problems.

       Yeah I am starting to see this side of the sub more often. SH and Boston are two sacred subjects and if you even suggest that they might have been legit tragedies you get jumped on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't think they were 100% legit but for example I have not seen a shred of legitimate evidence to suggest that the boston thing used actors. There are a lot of weird things you can point out in pictures but nothing that actually rises to the level of true evidence.
This is a tough opinion to present on these boards without being attacked.

       This is the problem with most skeptics though, they normally take the craziest portions of conspiracy theories and paint everyone with one broad stroke.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 for example, i don't think it happened the way the official narrative says but i also don't think no planes hit the buildings.  Yet, i'm painted as a "truther" by 99% of people and it's implied that i believe in every ridiculous theory ever presented.

       This is the problem the OP was talking about. I think that video is fairly compelling but there is no smoking gun and nothing that can be considered hard evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "strap system" can be explained by the fact that many people were wearing lanyards that day and the first thing you're supposed to do when someone has an injury like that is apply a tourniquet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other things like the misapplication of the right prosthetic. You can google pictures of Jeff Bauman and see his right leg on that day and it looks fairly convincing. If it was not applied correctly I think you'd be able to see his stump.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand there are very few pictures of his right leg, almost every other picture shows his left leg clearly and the right is obscured in some way. To me this lends credence to the theory that he was an actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully you can see that people can be on the fence or even disagree with you without being shills or "blue-pills".
      </p>
      <p>
       Why decide on something that you can't really know? We don't have all the data and it's foolish to make up your mind at this point.

       This is absolutely true and another reason why making up your mind on SH is a bad idea. There are so many redacted photos and videos that it's impossible to know what went on there that day. All I know is that I have not seen hard evidence that Adam Lanza was there that day.

       it is irrefutable. believe your eyes or deny. if you or others have not done the work needed to know about the hoody crouch photo and the other photo with the straps on his head whose fault is that? it doesn't change the facts.

       Sandy Hook is not possible to be 100% but Boston it absolutely is.

       Sandy Hook there are just too many blanks. Still nothing wrong with theorising about what those blanks may contain.

       I know the mods can't be everywhere but damn they honestly from my point of view don't really care if a well known submitter calls people shills.  They just slap them on the wrist.  I get called a shill all the freakin time and honestly it happens more than it doesn't from what I've seen.  This is why I don't really like commenting here.  I just go to some of the smaller more well maintained subs about conspiracies.

       It's actually kinda funny.  In this sub I'm called a shill a lot because I don't always agree with the posts.  A lot of them I don't agree with and think they are pretty debunkable and if they are I comment on why I don't agree with the post.  Inside this sub I get labeled a shill.  However, the other day I was debating something in another sub with somebody and their "trump card" on me was saying: "This coming from a guy who vists
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ."  This was their way of saying that nothing I say is credible because I go on this sub.  If he took the time to read my comments here he would see that I'm usually discrediting claims that are silly, but nevertheless just the fact that I comment here makes me seem not credible to people.

       People don't understand the implication of shill. Shill is like a troll who is being paid. A shill or a troll isn't just someone who argues the other side, they are someone who argues the side that they don't actually believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a troll they do it for the laughs, for a shill they would have some vested motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to settle down with the shill thing. I think most people here are either trolls or legitimately believe the stuff they are saying even if they haven't spent enough time studying the topic to make this evident.

       I tend to believe that also.  I think there are definitely people here trolling but some of the theories that I see people posting seem like they are so absurd nobody would really believe them.  Someone around the anniversary of JFK's assassination posted a theory with a link about how the real shooter was actually Jackie Kennedy and she was a Russian spy.  Anyone watching the video or who studied it at all could tell you this is ridiculous.  This seemed to be a theory so that when somebody says "I don't believe the official JFK story" the person retorting could say "yeah you conspiracy theorists think it was the cia, or the mob, or jackie kennedy etc." and it makes all the "theories" look equally laughable even though they aren't.  I do believe some theories are made up to discredit the entire community.

       You're absolutely wrong about this and I resent the implication. If you don't know enough about Sandy Hook and the Boston Bombings to see they were hoaxes, fine, but if you want to tar those who have a better understanding than you do, as "provocateurs", then I have a problem with that.

       You are proving OP's point. Because I think the conspiracy is more likely the FBI planned an op that went terribly wrong (not without precedent, see OK City, underwear bomber, etc), and not that hundreds of people contributed to a big stage set fake act as shown in explicit detail on YouTube, you think I belong in

       I didn't say that everyone who believed that was a provocateur. I said that provocateurs come out of the woodwork to attack you whenever you mention an alternate conspiracy theory. Et voila. Weird, didn't expect that to happen so quickly, but hey, thanks for proving a point.

       Also, while I would like this sub not to be discredited so much, it's natural that people would feel threatened by it and do this -- but anyone who takes a few minutes to read will see past the propaganda if they have good sense.

       If somebody is being blatantly abusive, then I'll report them, but otherwise I don't want to go reporting people just because they're suspicious about my intentions or call me a name. I've got pretty thick skin, and I'm sure you get enough of that. I prefer to try to convince them I'm sincere, which sometimes works, but often falls flat.

       I tend to believe that also.  I think there are definitely people here trolling but some of the theories that I see people posting seem like they are so absurd nobody would really believe them.  Someone around the anniversary of JFK's assassination posted a theory with a link about how the real shooter was actually Jackie Kennedy and she was a Russian spy.  Anyone watching the video or who studied it at all could tell you this is ridiculous.  This seemed to be a theory so that when somebody says "I don't believe the official JFK story" the person retorting could say "yeah you conspiracy theorists think it was the cia, or the mob, or jackie kennedy etc." and it makes all the "theories" look equally laughable even though they aren't.  I do believe some theories are made up to discredit the entire community.

       when you have spent the time to know the bigger picture and know there is a photo of hoddy guy crouched near the spot before the bomb goes off holding a leg shaped bag... then another photo of him entering the scene with several premade straps on his head/neck....

       it is irrefutable. believe your eyes or deny. if you or others have not done the work needed to know about the hoody crouch photo and the other photo with the straps on his head whose fault is that? it doesn't change the facts.

       Sandy Hook is not possible to be 100% but Boston it absolutely is.

       Sandy Hook there are just too many blanks. Still nothing wrong with theorising about what those blanks may contain.
