       soooooo I recently went to a startup competition and came across this company...I figured if anyone would appreciate this as much as I did it would be everyone here. It is a supposedly secure email system that encrypts your messages, doesn't read them, and servers are in switzerland. It is called proton mail check out...

       Want to know how they bypass this stuff? Simple get someone hired at the company.

       Also wasn't there something in Snowdens leaks about Swiss cooperating with the NSA to track bank accounts? If so what's to stop them from working with them again?

       NSA proof mail is easy, but it requires that you only communicate within one single server that you or someone you trust administers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ensure only (patched) SSL connections to and from the server, do not actually download the emails locally unless you are sure that your workstation is not one with a built in back door.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, use linux, and secure it properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you just set up an email account for the user  you wish to talk to, and one for yourself, and you are good to go.

       Control panels such as cPanel would provide such a user friendly way to get this set up. (At least after initial install of the OS and control panel itself, which most datacenters will do for you if they offer the panel licensing.)

       As with anything, in order for functionality from the hardware to exist, it must be supported by the operating system. Linux is an open source operating system, and is much harder to incorporate even hardware back doors, as the source code is open and globally peer reviewed.

       I have had a weird experience with this. I set up an account and this morning I noticed I had a "click to confirm" from Proton in one of my google boxes.  I figured I would do so when I got home and could spend some time with the service.
This evening, the "click to confirm" is gone....pfffft. Nowhere to be found. I searched my accounts individually, searched trash and spam... Nothing. Of course now I cannot set up the account again as the user name is taken.
I'm no conspiracy freak, but this makes me very uncomfortable. That email was there this morning, and now it's gone.

       Yeah that is very interesting. I signed up during beta and they had a note that said..we are still in beta don't use this yet as primary mail as some mail may never get delivered or may disappear, but yeah I don't know that is strange. It is interesting with this story coming out about lavabit though. I wonder how this company would be able to avoid the same fate.

       It is almost inevitable that there will be some sort of government "eye" observing everything we do, write or say. The 911 horror essentially assured that would happen, and at the same time gave the government a clear path to spy on its citizens. I mean, who could be against more stringent rules in an attempt to prevent more terrorism?
      </p>
      <p>
       And while part of me is repelled by the thought of being watched, another part of me is thankful that there is someone out there taking care of me (us). Ultimately, I believe we are going to have to give up some freedoms for order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, I am more concerned with the relentless attempts to control the Internet - what I see and say, and who will give me broadband speed or hold it back. That is of prime concern, even more so than people watching me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have nothing to hide, and I don't think my mundane existence would be of interest to anyone, but the ability to do what I am doing right now, bitching out into the ether, is vitally important in a free society.  Yes, I am being watched, but I can tell people about that.

       Is it possible to ever trust any "NSA-proof" webmail platform as anything but a honeypot?

       I wouldn't.  Seems like folly, and unnecessary risk.  Just use encryption.

       I think the point is that NSA apparently has the ability to break any type of modern encryption via brute force using DARPA-born quantum computers (or at least data encrypted with an app that they didn't already have a backdoor built-in).

       I fear that in this modern age, either do no wrong or go full stone-age with your communications.

       So if the government focuses all their resources on you as an individual there's not much you can do to avoid them. However, by making encryption mainstream we can make their efforts of mass unmitigated surveillance very difficult and inefficient, which is much better than the way things are now with existing communication platforms and email providers.

       I think so...I talked with the founders of this company personally they were pretty passionate about their product. It was actually designed for chinese dissidents to communicate privately within Chinese borders.
