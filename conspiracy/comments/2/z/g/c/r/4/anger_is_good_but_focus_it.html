       Yes, I believe you would be. His actions are because he feels disaffected from the group. For some reason he has dehumanised himself or others and by doing so he is able to hurt his fellow human beings. You must show him forgiveness and compassion and attempt to include him to a greater degree in the community so that when he feels that connection it is impossible for him to wrong others. Easier said than done, I know, but it's still the right thing to do.

       I'm well aware they exist and though myself and many others suffer as a result of their actions I still feel compassion and understanding for them as they do not get to experience the joy of meaningful relationships. It's the worst kind of punishment really.

       It's never worked before.  You  can change a sociopath by convincing them they benefit from acting proper, but not from rewarding them after they walk all over you.

       Sociopaths actively seek those types of people out and abuse them.

       Then I suggest you try again. If you perceive people to be good then you will see the good in them, if you perceive some people to be beyond salvation then you will dehumanise them and become cruel and callous yourself. This reality is a lesson for us. The ones who need love the most are the ones who ask for it in the strangest of ways.
      </p>

       I would request a citation for your claim but I know you don't have one. How would you know how many sociopaths have been redeemed through the unconditional love of others?

       The died to give you the opportunity to practice forgiveness and compassion to a race that suffers every day, in that they are disconnected from source and disconnected from love. These beings are simply at the extreme end of the polarity that exists in the universe. You may wish to exterminate them, but in essence you are only exterminating an element of yourself.

       They have made themselves almost untouchable, they are not an element of myself, they very much want to rid the world of your polarity and people like you along with it. There is no reasoning with those who have no reason. Their boredom is not my responsibility and it is our natural born right to defend ourselves against an imminent threat. At this point in time your mindset is nothing less than suicide, which is the ultimate sin.

       Dude, you should listen to yourself. Maybe they can rid this world of my polarity, but the thoughts I project outwards are something that will exist in the universe eternally and that cannot be gotten rid of. We have SUCH a limited perspective from this vantage point. How can you make any of your claims with any degree of certainty? We are immortal beings, we have nothing to fear but fear itself, as it is that which creates and empowers the demons that haunt us.

       The thing about the universe is that it zooms in and out but remains unchanged from atoms to solar systems. Our perspective is perfectly adequate enough to determine right and wrong, and cause and effect. No living being on earth goes down without a fight, even plants have some sort of defense mechanism. I'm nowhere near afraid but I do wonder about your depression. Your abnegation isnt fooling anybody.

       Hahaha. I don't know where you're at regarding hyperdimensional entities, but this emotional energy that you're projecting outwards at them is exactly the energy they thrive off. As they are disconnected from source, they require generating negative energy to nourish them and maintain their existence. Once you accept that these entities exist, yet their very existence means that life/soul/spirit is infinitely more intricate than we perceive from this limited perspective. It's great that you feel so strongly towards the injustices of the world, but if there was no negativity in the world, how can we experience the relativity of goodness?

       Damn good points.
      </p>
      <p>
       May I give you the concept that "goodness", as we currently know it, is solely based upon all the evil in this world.  If you were to beat me every day for a year, and then one day you don't beat me and give me a cookie, I would consider that as being "good".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all about perspective.  We have the ability to make this world a paradise, but we don't, because a very few people that are benefiting upon this Hell we call life, has convinced us that we can't do it.

       I don't know about the circumstances of your life, but I myself definitely experience goodness that is not itself just goodness relative to shitness. I share wonderful connections and experiences with beautiful people. I believe there is a certain universality to these moments of goodness as they are fundamentally expressions of love.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do totally agree with you that it's all a matter of perspective though. That's why it's so important to choose what perspective you examine things from. This experience is itself, so far removed from the universal neutral that when we are connected with our true nature, the contrast will be like nothing we've ever experienced before even in our most ecstatic moments. This is happening too. It's hard to choose to perceive this when you solely focus on the negativity, but if you spend some time looking at the potential for transformative action from other arenas you may find there is still many reasons to be optimistic.

       You mentioned love.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no such thing here for most.  "Love" to most, is an emotion they feel toward another.  This is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love is not an emotion.  Love is a way of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       How they see "love", is the absence of fear.  Everyone has fears, and they look at their partner as someone who can alleviate those fears.  If they are afraid of having to pay bills, and their partner can pay those bills, that's how much they "love" their partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's estimated that about 50% of divorces are caused by money, and that's just the people that are being honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these people have no concept of what love truly is, and the most pathetic point is that they don't care.

       There is still love. Romantic love and love are different aspects of the same phenomena. Everyone experiences love to a degree, and it's the reason why they attach a value to their life. If there was no positive experience, then there would be no reason to fear nothingness as it would be a reprieve from the endless suffering they endure. They experience it from their family, for their pets, for nature, for themselves. It's an irrational force that makes you endure the shitness of this world of suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't dispute that most don't experience it to it's full extent though. That's why I try to radiate it in my life and surround myself by people who do likewise. The results are profound. But as I said before, this is by design. There's been technology deployed that interferes with our capacity to experience it. We've been subsisting on a diet of way less love than we are actually supposed to be receiving. That's what's going to make the transition so dramatic when it occurs and this technology is eliminated ;)

       At some point the lose of your own self in the action has to take center stage, unless you are willing to die for this person to continue being as they are.  All people cannot be saved.  Humanity is neither good nor bad, we are at our core inherently selfish.  It has to be that way evolutionarily or we would not survive as a species.  The only time we are not inherently selfish is with children, which also furthers our species survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with your premise, but there is no way to know if said person can ever feel that connection, how long that connection would take, or how great the loss while you wait for him to accept that connection.  If he is beating everyone else up, there is a good chance he has suffered in life already and the part that would make a connection is broken.  In a perfect world we could save everyone.  But sometimes the risk of loss is too great.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thats when the selfish need to survive and thrive takes over and violence becomes necessary.  While I simply love your outlook, humanity cannot thrive with that type of principle.  A sociapathic killer could kill dozens, even hundreds, before finally making a connection with his/her fellow man.  Are those peoples lives expendable to reach one person? The greater good would dictate the person has to go.  The selfish desire to survive says to choose my own well being first over his.  Violence is a means to an end if necessary.

       You've presented a false dichotomy there. I'm not saying I would just lay down and say kill me, I love you. It is possible to apprehend this person and remove them from society without having to murder them. In removing them from society it's also possible to still treat them with compassion and respect rather than just an animal that we want to hurt and maim in retribution for their actions. That's some primitive shit right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity has survived with this kind of principle in the past. The Australian Aborigines survived as a continual culture for 50 000 years and the laws they practiced were essentially ones that tried to re-include any offenders back into society (though with some kind of physical punishment as well). Sure they killed others in tribal warfare etc, but that in my mind was due to a limited perspective, seeing those of another tribe as different from themselves.

       I think violence is good when it is necessary for survival. In fact, life you could argue that life is basically half predicated upon violence. After all, no life would exist without catabolism.

       Violence isn't inherently bad.  It depends on the cause and what the other options are.  This nation should never forget that it was formed in the violence of the revolutionary war.  Violence for the sake of violence is wrong.  Violence with a purpose is a tool.
