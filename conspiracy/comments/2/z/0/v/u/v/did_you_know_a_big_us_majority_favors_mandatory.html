       <p>
        According to
        <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/24/poll-big-us-majority-fa_n_6742162.html">
         a Reuters poll
        </a>
        recently published in the Huffington Post, 87% of America wants your right to choose whether or not you vaccinate yourself and your children to be straight up taken away from you:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "A large majority of Americans favor mandatory vaccinations of children, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Tuesday, apparently unswayed by some senior Republicans who have raised fears the medical shots could lead to autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Seventy-eight percent of respondents in the online survey said all children should be vaccinated unless there is a direct health risk to them from vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Only 13 percent opposed vaccinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       "“The numbers are absolutely overwhelming in favor of vaccinations with a consistent minority in opposition,” said Ipsos pollster Julia Clarke."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You know, we aren’t even really hearing about
        <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/oh-no-measles-were-all-gonna-d-wait-do-you-wanna-see-what-measles-looked-like-before-vaccinations_012015">
         the measles outbreak
        </a>
        that led to all this fear and calls for mass mandatory vaccinations anymore, just by the way.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people running the show and imposing this agenda already got the reaction they wanted out of that situation, obviously. They don’t even have to bring it up anymore.
       </p>
       <p>
        People are actually
        <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/right-to-vaccinate-vs-medical-tyranny-what-happened-to-freedom-of-choice/">
         clamoring over themselves to take their fellow Americans’ medical rights away
        </a>
        (and thus, eventually, have their own rights stolen from them as well). People never seem to realize what a slippery slope this kind of situation is.
       </p>
       <p>
        If they will do it here (taking an inch of our rights on medical freedom), then they will do it everywhere else (when they take a mile of our rights in whatever other areas they so choose).
       </p>
       <p>
        This shouldn’t be about what everyone else (and a bunch of pharmaceutical megacorporations) thinks we should do with our bodies. This is about everyone having the right to decide what goes inside of their bodies, a right that’s slowly being sucked away from us day-by-day in this country (Monsanto, anyone?).
       </p>
       <p>
        What a clear and shining indication that propaganda works, critical thinking skills are sadly going extinct, and large swaths of the population have easily handed over their lives to the mainstream media and the so-called “experts” it exhalts in this scientific dictatorship that runs our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Haven’t any of these people ever played chess? This is the long game and they are losing…

       It's funny, as Americans we believe in freedom of speech, the right to bear arms but if you wear a white lab coat you can inject anything you wish into me because Big Pharma said it is right.  Holy shit, please Mr. Big Pharma tell me what I need injected into my body.  Big Pharma would never do it for profit or have ever made any drug that has hurt anyone. It's sad how our society has turned into Lemmings. I once thought we were a free thinking progressive society and not followers like China. Sad.
