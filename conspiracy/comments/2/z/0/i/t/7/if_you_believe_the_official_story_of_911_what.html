       How after New York had already been hit and the Nation was under the highest military alert, a known hijacked plane could fly half way across the USA and turn around and fly (without interference)  all the way back to one of the most heavily protected air spaces and buildings in the world(Pentagon and surrounding air space) and at the last moments do a big aerial loop while coming in fast and low to slam into the side of the Pentagon. How could that happen without that commercial jet getting hit by an absolute shit storm of Air Force, Naval, Army, and Pentagon on ground protection.  This is the question that makes military people doubt the official government conspiracy theory. Many will tell you that this is an absolutely impossible government lie. -OP, I know this is not what you were looking for but here it is anyway.

       Here is my explanation. First, it did not go halfway across the U.S., it went 1 state over. Second, it was not intercepted because the transponder was shut off preventing  a 7500 squak (hijack). Third it was hijacked between 8:51 and 8:54, airspace was closed at 9:45. Fourth it flew a path with minimal radar so it was hard to tell where it was going. Fifth and finally, it did not loop, it went low and fast so by the time any jet could reach it it had crashed. A c130 was sent to confirm the jet, but once it saw it the plane crashed into the pentagon.

       Unfortunately thats garbage. It didn't need to sqawk 7500 because they already knew it was off course and not making radio contact. They already knew it was hijacked. They absolutely could and were tracking it on radar the entire time.

       Cheney was getting regular updates on its position, and didn't do anything about it. This is on the record fact.

       Air force interceptors were well within range, could have shot it down, but for unknown reasons turned and did a loop over the ocean. Unfortunately all records of why were mysteriously deleted.

       And this is the sort of attempted explanation that fails to deal with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       20 miles or 1000 miles, It doesn't really matter because this idea that the military can't know what's going on in the sky with transponders turned off in non-sense, especially with a large slow passenger airliner. East coast USA is not a minimal radar area especially any where near Arlington. The official story has a loop maneuver. Fighter jets, not a worthlessly slow c130, would have dealt with a hijacking, and especially any kind of  threat to the Pentagon airspace. If a passenger airliner hit the Pentagon, it would have taken a stand-down order from the highest levels to make the multiple protections for the Arlington airspace to fail to protect the Pentagon that day, especially from a non-responding passenger airliner.

       This idea that we get from the official government conspiracy theory that a group of radical Islamist can get to the USA and go to a little pilot training school in Florida to fly small planes can quickly go fly huge passenger airliners and fly them with such skill as to hit a low building while avoiding military response is a ridiculous idea.

       I understand enough to know that you are not going to avoid military radar and satellite detection on the East coast of the USA. And if the military wanted to put physical eyes on a aircraft they could do it from multiple air bases and navy ships quite quickly with super sonic fighter jets. They would not use a slow prop driven c130.

       Satellite detection? Really? Please tell me how you think that works.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a post of the 9/11 Commission report you did earlier, says the plane was 5 miles away when it did the turn and approached the Pentagon on collision course. 5 miles! By the time a fighter would have gotten in the air, the plane had struck the Pentagon.

       Fighter jets would have been involved with the airliner long before the 5 miles. Maybe this will help you start learning something about satellites.

       Again, the fighter would have been way off. A typical cruising speed for commercial airlines is 546-575 miles per hour. The hijacked plane would have been moving faster than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satellites are impressive yes, but I don't understand how you think it was supposed to help us detect a commercial airplane being hijacked. Unless you have a direct video link, satellite imagery of an event in progress is useless until afterwards. So I'm not too sure what your argument is about that.

       Satellites were not the main thrust of my argument, so get over it. I just mentioned it as one part of the many tools the the military has at its disposal to see what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fighter jets had plenty of time to scramble to deal with that supposed hijacked airliner long before it got to Arlington.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess we are suppose believe that during a state of national alert because of planes being flown into buildings, the Pentagon was so unprotected that even a known hijacked plane, flown by Muslim terrorist with almost no experience could not be effectively dealt with.

       The pentagon also had missles defending it.  Why they were not launched, is a mystery.  Before any one chimes in and says they didn't.  Its the pentagon.  They have a defense system there. You did not hear about them for the obvious.  They were not used and how would you explain that?  You cant, so they took the approach of not mentioning them.

       I never said that a turned of transponder hides them from radar, they cant tell whats going on on a plane unless they are told or the transponder squaks a code that tells them. I never said the entire east coast is a minimal radar area. it went into zones without radar, some areas are spotty but at least 98% of the east coast has radar. If the official story has a loop please link me to that part, from what I have read I never saw any part about a loop of a airliner. They sent a c130 because something seemed wrong but they could not confirm the aircraft, the c130 was the closest aircraft to it and they needed confirmation on what the aircraft was VERY quickly if something was wrong. They didn't know at that point it was hijacked. The last sentence you wrote I could not really understand.

       We are told that
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77">
        According to the 9/11 Commission Report, as Flight 77 was 5 miles (8.0 km) west-southwest of the Pentagon, it made a 330-degree turn. At the end of the turn, it was descending through 2,200 feet (670 m), pointed toward the Pentagon and downtown Washington. Hani Hanjour advanced the throttles to maximum power and dived toward the Pentagon. While level above the ground and seconds from the crash, the wings knocked over five street lampposts and the right wing struck a portable generator, creating a smoke trail seconds before smashing into the Pentagon.[36][37] Flight 77, flying at 530 mph (853 km/h, 237 m/s, or 460 knots) over the Navy Annex Building adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery,[38] crashed into the western side of the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, just south of Washington, D.C.

       That 330-degree TURN was one hell of a thing for these "Muslims" to be pulling off with a large airliner, fresh out of small plane school, to set up a crash path into the Pentagon. And all this without military interference.

       According to that logic, it is hard to turn a small almost like wheel and pull it until your facing the direction you want it to. A large airliner control column is actually quite similar to small planes yokes.

       Sorry, but flying an airliner is far more complicated than a small plane, especially when you a trying to set up hitting something at ground level at high speed.  Not to mention hitting things on your way to the target. These Muslims must has been extremely skilled veteran professional pilots.

       I never said that it was easy to fly a large airliner, but its not as hard as starting with one. Depending on the way they were trained it can be not extremely hard but not easy to fly a airliner.

       Hitting the pentagon on that exact spot would be pretty damn hard, you're right. Hitting the pentagon (period) wouldn't be that hard, that thing is big. I don't get why people tend to think they tried to impact on that exact wall at that speed and angle of descent. They probably were aiming to the pentagon, just flying in that general direction.

       I did not say "on that exact spot". I'm saying that hitting the Pentagon would be hard, especially for inexperienced pilots who just did a 330-degree turn. And as far as just aiming at the general direction, that is not so simple either, especially at high speed. You would first of all have to find the ground level target and set up for it and maintain without losing course. Why do the 300-degree if all they wanted to do is slam into any part of the Pentagon? This whole situation looks like something a professional airliner pilot would have to do.

       I don't know about how hard would it be to hit the pentagon on any spot, the building is pretty big. I really haven't looked much into the pentagon crash, just enough to know there were some pieces of the plane, and it seems like a plane crash. If not, what was it?

       The only reason there is a debate about what hit the Pentagon is because the government has refused to release the video from about 80 cameras. That video footage would has ended any debate about what hit the Pentagon. If the government has nothing to hide, why don't they release the video? And why have they kept the video from the public for over 13 years?

       So "The FBI, by its own admission, has 83 such videos" yet instead of quoting the source (the admission itself) you quote "911hardfacts". Well, I'm going to pull the [citation needed] inside of the citation, cause they say that "by their own admission" yet there's no link to that admission, as if 911hardfacts had something to hide.

       I don't know what happened at the Pentagon. Maybe a bomb exploded, a missile ,a military aircraft, or a military drone. The Government could stop hiding the videos so we can know for sure what happened. They are the reason for the doubt. They have been hiding the evidence for 13 years. There is no good reason to trust what the U.S. government says.

       So you basically have 5 theories, for which you have 0 evidence whatsoever, and all those theories collide with reality (plane parts, the passengers of the plane being dead, the knocked down lamp posts, the primitive drones of 2001...)

      <p>
       That's a great way to screw up a conspiracy. "Hey,we want this to happen, but instead of asking bin laden to orchestrate the attacks and maybe have some radar operator look the other way, let's orchestrate a really elaborate plan that's full of holes and that would involve thousands of people, and have bin laden take the blame anyway".

       So, there's no other viable theory, there's some released footage that points to the plane crash, there's eyewitnesses, there's the debris, there's all the dead people from that plane, but not enough evidence. Also, the official story adds up perfectly, the plane course has been perfectly detailed and there have been finite element models of the plane crash that provide similar results to the damage observed. But if you just choose to ignore all the evidence, it's easy to say there's no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me fix your first sentence: You don't have a clue of what happened at the pentagon, you just KNOW the official story is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       God, if that's your stance on the pentagon, I can't even imagine what could your theory about the WTC.

       You can't tell what happened with that released footage. There are conflicting eye witnesses. The terrorist were poorly trained pilots. Assuming flight 77 did hit the Pentagon, that would make me think that the plane was allowed to hit it. The Pentagon would have been left defenseless. Don't change what I said.

       Yes, shoot down a plane that comes close to the pentagon, without knowing what's happening inside. Then you get all the responsibility of 200+ civilians dead. Also, it's not like there's an airport 1Km from the pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why would this government cover up for the last government. I'm pretty sure that if any conspiracy on 9/11 was proved, the democrats would stomp every election for at least 20 years. It just doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, that theory just seems too complicated to me, or at least weird. Do you have real planes crash at the WTC but then a false plane or a drone crash at the pentagon?? What's the thought process behind such a stupid plan? Wouldn't it be easier to order the attacks and just have your security department look the other way instead of having a missile hit the pentagon, and whatever your stance on the WTC attack is?

       Yeah, I can get behind that kind of conspiracy. Conspiring by having some people look the other way. It takes few people, so it could be doable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the first plane hit, the airspace over NY should've been fortified. But the problem with this kind of conspiracy is that it's really hard to tell incompetence from malevolence, so it's really hard to prove.

       Don't misunderstand me, I also think the public should be able to see all the videos. But of that list, there's more than half that aren't from the pentagon, and with the pentagon having 5 external faccades, I would bet my life most of the videos listed there don't show anything. That's why they just released a few. They released footage of a camera aimed at the spot the plane crashed for god's sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, that's not a statement by the FBI saying they have those videos and are not willing to release them. That's someone asking for those videos, we're not shown a reply, or have any evidence that those videos exist or are unreleased.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of evidence. Ignoring it makes easy to believe retarded conspiracies.

       We don't know how many videos show what took place. If there is a cover-up, I don't doubt that they would hide the best video evidence. Why do they insist on keeping any of it from the public if there is nothing to hide? The big questions are why the Pentagon was left absolutely defenseless on 9/11 and how could such poorly trained Muslim terrorist have flown a large passenger airliner so well and defeated U.S. intelligence, and military to have made all this happen.

       The government refuses to release all the video. Why? Release it all and let the public decide what is and is not relevant to this issue of what did or did not hit the Pentagon. Release all the 9/11 information so the public can examine it against the official government conspiracy theory.

       A turn that radar observers assumed was a fighter because of the manavor.  A pilot who could barley or couldnt fly a single engine cessena (the instructor refused to fly with him his skills were so poor,) like Hanni Hanjour is not going to have the skill to preform a manavor pilots with thousands of hours filght time said thy could not do in those planes.

       Ok explain whats incorrect. I said a transponder does not hide from radar, which is correct. you cant tell exactly what goes on in a plane unless the transponder squaks a code or are told via radio, which is correct. The east cost mostly has radar, but depending on height you can hide from radar, which is correct. The plane did not loop it turned as said a bit above. They sent a c130, posted above. its almost not possible to know its a hijacking unless something shows that there is people in the cockpit taking control.

       I don't care about any C130. The point is fighter interceptors were well within range, they knew the aircraft was hijacked as aircraft had already hit the WTC and this one was off course, not making contact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the interceptors were directed by an unknown person, out over the ocean. They finally were sent in the right direction, after the flight had hit the pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're speaking uneducated rubbish about 'not possible to know its been hijacked unless something shows theres someone in the cockpit'. Obviously, if the aircraft is off course, not speaking, not squaking the radio failure code 7600, during a terrorist attack, it has been hijacked. As a pilot, I should know.
      </p>
      <p>
       It made a 270 degree descending corskscrew turn. This made a loop on radar, therefore I think its fine to call it a loop.

       If air traffic control doesn't get a response or the correct response the military will quickly take over the situation. I guess you think these Muslims knew how to make an off course airliner avoid being noticed.

       It's easy to say you could have done this or that, but that's hindsight. Even with information, you still have to make decisions and the OICs wanted proof. When that proof came, it was in a very devastating way.

       The military responded often before 9/11 to "situation" aircraft. There was plenty of time before that airliner would have gotten to Arlington for the military to have responded and to proved whatever.

       I understand your points, but the FAA had specific protocol on dealing with hijacked or suspected hijacked planes.  It was common practice, or slightly over once a week planes were intercepted.  For one of these 3 reasons.  Loss of radio contact.  If a plane goes off course.  The transponder gets turned off.  If any one  of those happen jets are scrambled, and with 15 minutes from one of those happening, they will or should have had been intercepted.  Also once NORAD is involved, they have much better radar than the FAA does and are not as dependant on transponders to locate planes.  Fact is, not one should have been able to reach its target if they were following the standard operating procedure that did on every other day before and after 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military had drills going on that morning of planes being hijacked, and flown in to buildings, including the WTC.  ATC was confused that am not knowing if it was real world or exercise, and had false blips on their radar during the events.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears the Air Defences were intentionally kept busy and confused during that time.  That is one thing I have had a hard time understanding is how the hijackers would have known about the drills going on, because you would think that info would be classified.  Because for the hijackers to know that they had drills of hijackings and planes being flown into the targets they struck, shows the genius the had.  What are the odds of that though.  Drills of actual events on the same exact day and same exact time.  I dont follow the revelence of airspace being close at 9:45  The times revelant are the times the planes showed one of the issues to be intercepted and why 15 min after that, they were not.

       Im on your side, I have looked into 911 for 13+ years. I know the story is crap, and need a new investagation.  I was trying to draw the believers of the official story out to see why.  Probe the weak points or what they believe are weak points of the official story, to exploit in later posts.  And also find any hard piece of evidence they cling to, in order to destroy it.  I get your passion for the subject, I share it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we sing to the chior persay, we cannot get new people to join the choir.   We need to engauge the believers out there with respect, and logic, and not come off like some of us do.  We have to give the appearence of an open mind, to expect the same in return.  You go into a conversation with some one appearing to be undecided and trying to get theyre take on it, plant seeds in the conversation, and alot of times the ones sure of the official story being right, will start to question themselves, just by you not being sure of what to believe.  I know full well what the evidence looks like, theat the story is total horse shit.  The ones who dont, obviously cant deal with the ugly truth it presents, so getting their "help understanding the events" of the day, playing the fool, like you dont know, will help get more doing what we need to do.  Demand a new investagation.  Every thing will come out there.  We just need to get there.  If that makes sense to you

       I am not a believer of the official story, or at the very least, I question it. Thruthfully, I can never know what truly happened there, all of us can't really. The piece of evidence which made me question the official story is Building 7. There are too many holes in that story.

       They have the 9/11 commission report which doesn't assign blame and doesn't discuss building 7, the part about who funded it is censored, and was used as a justification to invade Afghanistan and Iraq after naming the majority of the perpetrators as Saudi.

       There's an extensive report by NIST, which is pretty informative without being the most technical paper out there. It also covers the possibility of a blast scenario (which is pretty hard without a blast, explosives are loud as fuck).

       The comments on the report are good too, arguing some things, but I'm too lazy to look them up right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: Not saying it wasn't an inside job, there's really not way of disproving that, but the phisics on the WTC collapses are sound. And wouldn't it be easier to tell osama "hey dude, have some planes crash somewhere important" instead of rigging everything with explosives without anybody noticing?

       I used to think that, but the fact is, the phisics on the collapses are anything but sound.  The buildings turned to dust in mid air.  After the top of the one was obviously tilting over, that would have took the load off of the rest of the building.  The near free fall speed they fell at supposedly through steel and concrete should have slowed them down.  Not continued like they were falling through nothing.  When buildings collaplse, they tend to turn to dust upon impacting the ground, not mid air.   I wish the phisics of the buildings destruction was sound, I would have been able to put this off as conspiract  theory.  The fact is, the only thing the evidence supports, is the use of controlled demolition.  Im not saying I know that for sure, but as far as scientific method, the buildings show no signs (zero) signs of collapse.  They show all signs of controlled demolition.  The only thing that showed signs of a collapse, was a heavly manipulated computer model, and that still couldn't duplicate a collapse like those 3 without the use of demolitions.

       Some of the parts of the buildings turned to dust in the air. There was a lot of rubble after the colapses. The near free fall speed is a bogus claim, as WTC 1 and 2 fell at speeds way below free fall, and WTC 7 had a free fall speed between t=1.75 and t=4, because that's when the buckling of the columns happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's good that you use the scientific method. But you haven't gone far on that method. You've done the first step, which is observing reality. Second step is making a hypothesis (controlled demolition is only the start of one, its definition is too broad, how did they demolish it would be a good theory). Then you can proceed to test that hypothesis, and see if it stands against science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, about the computer model, they did duplicate the results during the process of peer reviewing needed for it to be republished by the ASCE.

       Sorry for not watching the entire video, but I just jumped to a random part in the video, around minute 14 he says the NIST report says that the collapse was at a constant acceleration. I went and checked the report, it doesn't say that, furthermore it specifically identifies 3 stages of acceleration. I don't know if the video is outdated or just false I can't take this seriously, if just jumping to a random spot I see a lack of regard to the truth that's so big.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he says he's a teacher of physics on the college and high school level (please, if you try to be serious leave out the high school level), but doing a quick search on google, I didn't find him listed on any university as a teacher, nor did I find any evidence of him having a physics background, or any peer reviewed papers on any serious publication.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to end, taking such a simplist aproach to the collapse of WTC as to use the simplest of newtonian physics, taking all parts as infenitely rigid objects is just ridiculous. There can be doubts about other parts of 9/11, such as who ordered it or who funded it, but the towers falling is pretty straightforward.

       Anyone can make a youtube video, there's plenty of them. I'm more into reading, so there's that. Find me any interesting scientific articles regarding how it was a controlled demolition and we might be onto something (serious scientific articles, not some random webpage crap, something that's publishable).

       Thats a hard one for me to wrap my head around also.  And I still would like to see something from the pentagon as far as footage.  I wonder why the wont release it?  I wish they would just to shut a lot of people up.  So we can move on.  I dont see anyone letting it go till they show it though.

       The only reason there is a debate about what hit the Pentagon is because the government has refused to release the video from about 80 cameras. That video footage would has ended any debate about what hit the Pentagon. If the government has nothing to hide, why don't they release the video? And why have they kept the video from the public for over 13 years?

       As strange as the collapse of tower 7 was I find the other possibility (that it was brought down by a controlled demolition) too hard to explain from a rationale standpoint, not to mention the other issues with this theory. Like, is this how the decision to bring down tower seven would have gone down:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Agent #1: So we have this plan that involves crashing a plane into each of the twin towers and bringing them down, crashing another plane into the pentagon, and a fourth plane will get brought down. I think that should be enough to precipitate a war.
       </p>
       <p>
        Agent #2: No we need something over the top. I know! Lets take down the much smaller building at the base of WTC that most people have never heard of, well do it after the building has been evacuated so it doesn't result in ANY fatalities, and we'll make such a small deal about that most people (even New Yorkers) won't even know it was among the buildings brought down.
       </p>
       <p>
        Agent #1: Brilliant! So then we'll just need a fifth plane to crash into WTC 7 then?
       </p>
       <p>
        Agent #2: Unfortunately thats not in the budget. How about we'll just rig it with explosives and hope nobody asks why it fell?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I mean is there something I'm missing? The rationale for bringing down WTC 7 in the context of a false flag operation makes little to no sense. Honestly looking for a reply

       The real question is why the US air force doesnt have interceptors patrolling or at the least ready to go in case something like this happens again.  The depressing reality is simply the defence department has zero interest in actually defending the country.

       They did have interceptors, though on the morning of 9/11 most were participating in war games, Operation Vigalant Warrior, Operation Vigilant Guardian, and many others.  As hard as it was for me to believe, they actually had drills of planes being hijacked and flown into buildings, including the WTC that morning at the same times.  They actually had and do have planes that are or in the case of 911 should have been sent to intercept airlines or any air traffic that loses radio contact, goes wildly off course, or there transponder gets turned off.   On 911 they hit the trifecta and yet not one plane was intercepted.  The year leading up to 911 the FAA and NORAD had intercepted 60+ planes that met one of the three qualifing factors.  So it wasn't something that would be considered out of the norm.  They didn't shoot down any of the 60+ but did have F-16s intercept them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do have an interest in defending this country, to the extent of actually having drills for the events.  Just on that morning it seems the system had a total and catastrophic heart attack 4 times, when usually it would be within 15min from issue to intercept.

       "When the USAF realized there were hijacked jets heading for a kamikaze strike on D.C., it was paralyzed, because—and I can’t say this loud enough—it had never given any thought to defending US airspace. There were no jets on patrol, and when a couple of smart pilots cut short their training mission to try to help, they were going to have to ram their jets into the hijacked planes, because there were no air-to-air missiles available to shoot down the hijacked jets on 9/11. The USAF had literally never thought about having to shoot down enemy jets over US airspace, so they didn’t have any missiles, and would have had to order pilots to ram the hijacked planes to bring them down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, yeah, but they learned their lesson, right? The armed services probably flooded our borders with fully-armed fighters after 9/11, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrong. They patrolled America’s skies for a few months after the WTC attacks, then stopped. They just weren’t into it:
      </p>
      <p>
       After the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the military flew 24-hour combat patrols over Washington and New York. Those round-the-clock patrols ended [in early 2002] after administration officials said stricter airport security, stronger cockpit doors and more federal marshals on flights had sufficiently reduced the threat of attacks."

       I know I'm not adressed, but... what I can't wrap my head around is why "believers" assert a tall, slender structure falls straight down, from top to bottom, through itself, and radially in all directions,
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       . It never happened. It never happens. It is very hard to reproduce absent some mechanical trickery. There simply is no model, there is not even a word for it, while we know something tall can tip, topple, fall over, break, bend, buckle, shear to the side... none of which happened with the twins. You can't call it implosion, you can't call it explosion, and it is not just a "collapse", it is a complete self-disassembly, a crumbling, dustification, most closely resembling the magic-induced collapse of Barad-Dûr. Even with the most generous assumptions - that there was a one-floor freefall, and that the top remained rigid - such a structure would require a built-in mechanism to allow for a plumb descent. Most of the time, the excuse is the scale of the towers, but square-cube law does not state that such a structure would behave
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       different from a 1 meter tower of dominoes or a house of cards - which, ironically, will not exhibit anything remotely resembling global progressive top-down collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: how can you call something "natural" or even "inevitable" if it is unique, unprecedented, and has never been modeled experimentally since?

       From my experience, it just seems like the "Truthers" rely more on faith than anything else, especially when it comes to things like the nanothermite. It was submitted to a lab anonymously quite awhile after the incident. Then the lab used the wrong method and never corrected it. Then the lab claims they sent out duplicate samples to other labs, but those results have never shown up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet people still claim nanothermite was found.

       This is a red herring that appeared like 8 years after the event. Of all the bits and pieces of suspiciousness, this one is both trivial and damning. It's trivial because there's plenty of other things that honest people could point to (Building 7, the hole in the Pentagon, etc.). It's damning because it is exaggerated in its significance; the official story proponents throw this one in peoples' faces as if the inability to prove the existence of nanothermite rules out controlled demolition, while glossing over the fact that the entire building (concrete and steel) was turned to
       <strong>
        dust
       </strong>
       ... not rubble...
       <strong>
        dust
       </strong>
       . I'm over 50 years old and have seen dozens of collapsed buildings, both accidental and deliberate, and never in my life have I seen one that was turned to
       <strong>
        dust
       </strong>
       without the use of explosives. And even those that did use explosives still left more rubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        DUST
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: What caused the buildings to turn to dust in mid-air as they were collapsing? Both towers did the same thing... burned for a while then started to collapse and just ... poofled into dust on the way down. How?

       Exactly! They also fail to explain the holes in the rubble steel, like Swiss cheese; the molten metal reported by first responders, pictures and television, and the core columns not "pancaking" in line with their theory. So many discrepancies, so much junk science. I hope some day they can just say, "yeah, it was controlled demo. We lied."
Wishful thinking sure, but I am getting tired of arguing this with the ignorant, misinformed masses.

       How have you applied the scientific method to this situation. Anyone can say they believe in the scientific method... not everyone can support it. I have a feeling you are one of those people but I wanted to give you the chance to prove otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm won't be surprised if you aren't able to do it. Science requires peer review of both the data used in reaching determinations as well as the method.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you use the scientific method as you say you do... you should understand why the government's case isn't defendable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what is defendable though? Your love of the scientific method... so let's hear it.

       Well I know the "government's case" can't fall under the scientific method, as not all evidence is available to the Everyman. All I've been able to do is eliminate several common hypotheses, such as the "towers turned to dust", "a nuke blew it all up" and "nanothermite burned it down". I'm not sure what other hypotheses are left.

       Don't confuse the failure to release information... with it not being available to everyone. There is a great deal of information/evidence that is not available to ANYONE.

       As far as the twin towers go... I usually give this one up. It's yours. Two airplanes caused the towers to collapse.

       I asked you how you applied the method to your beliefs. You stated the theories that you have written off as false but you haven't given me what I clearly asked you for. How did you apply the scientific method to rule those things out?

       It doesn't get much less scientific than that. It goes beyond incompetence... they went against the investigation steps required by law. Their report isn't just unscientific and without peer review... it is criminal.

       You asked me to show you why the official conspiracy relies on faith? 
The NIST report on building 7 is a good example. NIST refused to release their computer modelling data to the public. That means we can't see how they arrived at their remarkable conclusions, i.e, that a high rise building can collapse into its own footprint in a perfectly symmetrical fashion in 6.5 seconds due to office fires. 
Their theory has not happened before or since or will ever again, yet were are asked not to study or scrutinize, but to take their word for it. To have faith in our government. This is the most non scientific, most dishonest position one could have. 
There are hundreds of examples like this one. The official conspiracy theory is a joke. They are lying to you.

       The penthouse collapses inwardly as the core columns are cut. Look at that video evidence again and ask yourself what you are seeing. You are watching a 47 story steel framed structure collapse due to office furnishings.

      <p>
       And yes, for 2.25 seconds it reached free fall, meeting no resistance whatsoever. Just gravity. Newton would be spinning in his grave.

       Ignore him.  He is here to waste your time and efforts.  the video evidence speaks for it self.  If some one sees that and is trying to say otherwise, it tells you one of two things.  He is intentionally fucking  with you  because he is paid to.  Or the fact he cannot  make simple analysis of video evidence that any one over 5 can tell you what it looks like.  NIST themselves could not explain the building 7 collapse.  If this guy can, or tries to assert his knowlegde of it, he is full of shit. period.  They're are many employed to do just exactely that. Tell you things that directly contracdict video evidence.  Like kennedys head shot was from behind.  They can try and baffle you with bs.  We know its bs.  If he wants the last word, let it go to and talk to someone with a realistic prostective or open mind.

       NISTs report is bad science. If you really believe, in your heart of hearts, that any steel framed structure can attain free fall for any length of time due to fire? Then you're either ignorant, misinformed, or an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       With every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. There was no equal or opposite reaction! Those buildings met no resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say that NIST's explanation cannot be taken seriously. A hallmark of the scientific method is to experiment and test and test again to come up with a valid hypothesis. They didn't test for explosives despite explosives being a perfectly valid reason for all three buildings coming down. They didn't look, therefore there was none. Sound like the tried and tested, leave no stone unturned rigmarole of science to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       The building collapses - an extraordinary event never seen before, after or ever will again. Yet they classify the data that led them to these conclusions. They don't want scientific scrutiny, and since the scientific community can't study how they arrived at their conclusions then NIST simply cannot be trusted.

       So you're mad they didn't test for explosives, despite it being painfully obvious that there weren't any explosions of significance during the collapses? Why not also test for giant wrecking balls, too?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the NIST report talks of some initial internal collapse in WTC7. That can lead to free-fall for some of the collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also keep in mind that once a building really gets going (in the collapse), resistance from each floor become negligible (not zero); there's a difference.

       Trouble about models is that the "scientific" community will not take them seriously, just like anyone who knows their left from their right do not take the NIST models seriously.

       Ads appeal to the mainstream. Most people, the majority certainly, don't even know about WTC7. Letting them see this is important. They can then ask, "why have I never seen this before?"

       As for study - what can you study? Since the evidence was shipped off to China. All we have is what we have, which, if you do some real research, is plenty enough to warrant another, truly Independent, investigation on the matter.

       Look I am not some crazy person. I believed everything my Gov told me. I believed them when they told us about WMD in Iraq, and when we Invaded Afghanistan I drank the kool aid and insisted there was a good reason for it. 
It wasn't until maybe 7/8years later that I began to question this. I didn't want it to be true, but it is unfortunately.

       You're only saying that because you don't know better. Look at how many thousands of new scientists graduate each year. Ten of thousands. And much less than 0.1% of them submit their name to a "Truth" blog. What does that tell you? There aren't enough jobs for all of them, so they're not risking anything. Use your head.

       The last question though? I'm interested to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the FBI admitted to record that they have no evidence linking Osama Bin Laden to 9/11, and since 9 of the 11 terrorist turned up alive and well after the event, as reported by the BBC. 
Who do you think, since there was officially no Bin laden or Terrorists, do you believe committed the attacks? 
I'm curious.

       Finally, do you believe that Saudis, possibly working with MOSSAD, can fool both the FBI and CIA combined? If you do then you are hopelessly naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone knows there was Saudi involvement, yet accept the uncalled for and illegal invasion of Afghanistan and Iraqi. Chasing WMDs that never existed and ghosts they made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone (you included I'm sure) accept that the Bush administration lied to get us into war, and more American's have died over there than on 9/11, with numbers increasing every day. They lied to make a fucking war, an endless on at that. Yet of course they would never have lied about 9/11.

       Here is just a brief snippet from NIST's own FAQs WT7 - 
Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
      </p>
      <p>
       Free fall. No resistance. Nothing there but gravity. They couldn't satisfactorily explain it, and they wouldn't allow the scientific community to study it.

       And the metric dig only shows your countries continued isolationist thinking, which continues to weaken you. How many people are with you? I think it's just you and Libya now. Great example of pointless stubbornness again.
