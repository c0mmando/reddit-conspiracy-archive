       Any 5 year old could look at a graph and figure out when the problem started, and what could be done to fix it.

       It doesn't take a genuis to look at the history of inflation and debt, and go.... it started, right here. 1913. Then the line goes straight up from there representing inflation and debt since then.  140 years good.  next 100 years, fucked.

       I ask for higher wages because, if I get them, maybe I'll be able to afford rent.

       If I were to ask why my money is worth less, and get a perfect answer, I'm still gonna be in the streets if I don't get higher wages.

       If your wage went up 100$ month or the price of rent went down 100$ you would still bank the same. The difference is as wages go up so do the cost of the employers so they raise the prices of there products then you basically arnt making any more money then you were just dealing with bigger numbers. Unfortunately prices generally go up faster than wages. The flip side I personally cant think of any time a business has lowered the price of anything because if people are already paying that price why lower it and if expenses get lowed then extra profits! Gotta love capitalism. Not sure what a good solution to the class warfare would be but all I know is the system we have doesn't really work that well for everyone.

       A little inflation (~1-2%) is good, because people spend money to prevent it from having less value in the future. The money they spend pays my wages, which I then spend to prevent myself from losing money in the future, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deflation is very very bad, because people hoard their money, since it will be worth more in the future. No spending means no money to pay wages.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if I had to choose between getting paid 10% more (inflation) or all prices going down by 10% (deflation), I'd choose the inflation every single time.

       I definitely see your point, but I think a new way of exchanging commodities would be beneficial. We started by just gathering for ourselves, than trading and bartering, then banks (and many versions of banking systems), now we need something new and better that may have not been introduced yet. Im just not sure what that would be. (Just to clarify im not hinting at communism or any thing like that, its already been tried and failed)

       Also, while fixing what causes inflation is probably better for the economy in the long run, it will take years to provide full relief.  Increasing minimum wage provides instant relief.

       This current system results in one thing. DEBT. That is why we fought for independence from England.  The taxes were high, but we wouldn't have revolted over that.  It was the demand to only be able to use money from the Central bank at interest, that puts them in the spot of never being able to come out of debt and in effect was slavery to the banks.  We did fine, no interest, no debt from 1776 to 1913.  Because its what we know now, doesnt mean we already had the answer before.

       If your that smart, use your intelligence to spread the word around.  I didn't know until I seen this video a few days ago that the buying power of the dollar was the same until 1913.

       Actually, if you check the chart on
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-inflation-since-1775-2013-1">
        this
       </a>
       page, you will see that the value of $1 in 1933 is still in the range of the previous timescale despite the recentness of WW1.  It was in 1933 that we abandoned the gold standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument is not that The Fed has nothing to do with inflation, rather that until we abandoned the gold standard , they could not maximize their interest-based profits by printing money at will, thus causing massive inflation.  One thing to remember also, is that for at least 30 years, CPI has been artificially lowered by a number of means, so it's actually much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. It actually was about 20% inflation between 1776 and 1913, but that's pretty insignificant.

       Thank you for the correction, the intention of this post was still accurate in the idea I was trying to convey right?  The fact Wilson sold our soul to the devil himself to be king for a day.  And we are faced with an eternity of paying for his couple year rule.   I figured ones who didn't know would see that, go why? and teach themselves.
      </p>

       I try to have people teach themselves, or HOW to think, instead of TELLING them WHAT  to think.  Or just getting people to think.  That is something our school systems stopped doing along time ago.  Again, thank you for point that out.  I should have put approx. and that would have saved the detail work.

       Incorrect (partially).
      </p>
      <p>
       From wiki: "...President Roosevelt implemented a series of Acts of Congress and Executive Orders which suspended the gold standard except for foreign exchange, revoked gold as universal legal tender for debts and banned private ownership of significant amounts of gold coin."
      </p>
      <p>
       Roosevelt ended the direct correlation between the amount of paper money in circulation with U.S. gold reserves, the relevant issue for domestic inflation.  The convertibility of the dollar to a fixed amount of gold internationally was left intact.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Nixon changed was the fixed relationship between the value of gold and the dollar, important for the international monetary system (free floating currencies based on market influence rather than each pegged to gold at a rate decided by each government; incidentally many currencies today are still pegged, not to gold but to other currencies, usually the U.S. Dollar) rather than to domestic inflation

       In the fiat system, yes. That's why when all these blowhards go on tv saying we need cut the debt, get our house in order, blah blah, they are either just saying it (lying) because it sounds like something we should do, or do not truly know how the system works. Our money is pegged to debt, the more debt the more money. Less debt = less money. Our economy would collapse if we cut the debt. So much for fiat currency. We really need a reset and to lock those in the FED and government in jail. Then peg our currency to gold and have the government coin currency, not the FED or any private institute.

       What people dont get is that its fine to have debt, just not any added interest to that debt. The interest is never borrowed, only the principal. The interest that banks charge is the reason we have war, poverty and famine. Eliminate interest and the worlds problems are solved. It really is that simple. Money is just a medium of exchange for our labors. Interest was only created to enslave people to the bankers. Burn them all.

       Investing shouldnt exist. Not in the current way it does. Its nothing more than casino gambling. Interest cannot be charged on money borrowed. Its a mathematical impossibility to ever pay it off. You only borrow the principal initially. Not the money to pay off the interest. If you charge interest, you have to keep the ponzi scheme alive in order to pay off the interest for you and the next guy, and so on. Google "money as debt". It really simplifies it for you. You'e been conditioned.

       Why are we done? Because your trying to hold on to a broken system that rewards greed? Explain why we need interest. I would love to hear your infinite wisdom on why we need to charge interest for anything. The current system only rewards banks and people who steal money from others as "investments". If I need to borrow $1m, why do I need to pay interest on that? You as the "banker" just conjured that money out of thin air. So somehow your entitled to make something from nothing? Sounds like a fairy tale.

       There's more to interest than just paying off debt. It's used for project planning, determining if something is worth doing, or if your money would be better suited elsewhere. There's a lot of people much smarter than I who do this for a living, across multiple career fields, not just finance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to your wording ("greed","steal","entitled",etc), it's obvious you have strong biases, that's why we're done. Even if I could convince you to see truth, it would only last as long as your next trip into the echo chamber.

       Your making no sense. Interest cant pay off debt. I never even said anything about that. Explain yourself. Quit acting like your smarter than me or everyone else and state your point. I dont think you know shit and your mindset is stuck in a broken economic system. I'm talking about changing our current system. I dont need "smart" people to tell me whether or not build a new bridge because the old one is failing or building a new sewer system in a metropolitan area because the old system in failing. Acceptable rate of return doesnt even factor into that.

       This is why Ron Paul's idea of returning to the gold standard demonstrates zero understanding of fiscal policy. There simply isn't enough gold in the world to represent the level of wealth that the US has, nor it's rate of growth.

       Its easy, print money, have the monopoly on it, loan it out to governments at interest, and the money they pay you back they have to borrow from you at interest, giving you a nation of people working to pay the interest to you, that will always be attached to every dollar made.

       That's because the opponents of the Federal Reserve died on Titanic. The Rothchilds murder anyone that stands in their way of making a buck. Look into the Malasian flight that got shot down over Russia. As Rothchd luck would have it, all the people on board we stock holders for a military microchip. Everyone is gone and the Rothchild family is now the sole owner to the right. That's like Larry Silverstein lucky (he took out a terrorism insurance policy on the twin towers a few months before 9/11. Almost like he knew it was going to happen. Jewish luck I guess..

       If you think the current FIAT money supply is manipulated, tying the value of the dollar to gold will make it even easier to manipulate. There isn't very much gold in the entire world, let alone the US. If DeBeers can control the worldwide diamond market, the powers that be can easily manipulate a warehouse full of gold. It's a good thing we are not on the gold standard anymore.

       Fiat money creates unsustainable debt when it is manipulated via actions such as quantitative easing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Setting our currency on a gold standard will keep its value relative to the price of gold. And since there is a finite amount of gold in the world, the values remain more stable, this inflation would be mitigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you are correct, in a way. Gold prices can be manipulated. However, it is much harder to do this than to simply print a few more trillions of fiat paper money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The easier currency is to mainpulate, the more corruption will germinate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gold standard currency is a much more beneficial currency, as it supports a more stable economy. The only problem is that societal advancement might be hindered a bit, because when a nation cant afford something right away, they will have to produce more goods and services. If that country had fiat money, they could just print some more bills, at the cost of interest and inflation, to get what they want sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
       So short term, fiat sounds fun, and gold standards seem old fashioned and boring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long term, fiat money destroys the countries that adopt it, while gold standards keep their little-engine-that-could steaming long after the other countries economies tanked.

       I don't see this as a problem but as an added benefit of the gold standard. Wars, pollution, deforestation, media manipulation, overpopulation, and centralized power are all exacerbated by fiat currency.

       I'm not even talking about manipulating the value of gold, i'm talking about manipulating the actual physical gold itself. There is ~6 trillion dollars worth of gold in the world, the world wide banking cartels could easily buy a controlling interest long before legislation put us back on the gold standard.

       Both sides of the argument are simple. I've just been willing to research my side. You're wishing to ascertain that separating from the gold standard was a good thing. Countless articles describe exactly why it was bad, and you're in a subreddit which has posted as such many times.

       Being that we (the US) allegedly have the physical gold in fort Knox, under US military security. I would venture to say it wouldn't be too hard for the US to say fuck you FED and expunge all debt owed them. This is a nation vs a bank, albeit a powerful bank, they do not have a military. So, if we really wanted to, we could. But the leaders are already bought and paid for, so they would never do this.

       The problem is the Federal Reserve having the ability to print money and essentially use inflation as a weapon against the american people. Putting us back on the gold standard wouldn't stop that, it would only make it easier.

       Right now the value of the dollar is determined by a bunch of different factors, consumer confidence, the worlds faith in the US ability to pay its debts, GDP, interests rates, etc. The Fed has two controls, interests rates and the ability to control the money supply. At the momment interests rates are effectively 0. If we tied the value of the dollar to a bunch of gold sitting in Fort Knox, all the Fed would have to do to tank the economy is continue to print money and destroy the economy with inflation.

       You're confused. With the gold standard the money supply is regulated by buying/selling gold. With the current system the money supply is regulated by debt and interest. There is a limited amount of gold on earth. Debt is unlimited. You have two systems completely bass ackwards.

       I would like to see our money based on tangible goods.  I'm all for representative money, like dollar bills or credits, but that can be exchanged directly for the commodity that they represent.  Our wealth as a nation is then based on what we can produce valued with real world items.

       Arguably there are benefits to fiat currency, but economists universally agree that the number one problem with the gold standard is that manipulation is HARDER to achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire point of fiat currency is to give governments the ability to manipulate the money supply, thus allowing an economic environments to forego recessions. Proponents of the gold standard think economies naturally fluctuate, and that intervention is a bad thing. You have it bass ackwards.

       Which made me wonder if there's more than one person running your account. This is pretty common among shills, and since from the outside it looks like you're shilling hard for the fiat system, I thought I'd ask.

       When I said "dude" I was talking about Kabuthunk not myself. Thanks for calling me a shill, I was waiting for that. Any opinion that doesn't follow the r/conspiracy party line is considered shilling, and I find that funny since ya'll constantly push "keep an open mind."

       Confirmed troll, you come in holding the opposite opinion as many people here with the intention of being called a shill because it's fun. You even refer to the user's of this sub as ya'll. You just proved you only frequent this sub to troll in one post. I see you put about as much effort into your trolling as you do forming your own opinions.

However if it ever needs to be replaced or moved for repairs... either the toilet or the drain lines under it... that will likely be the most annoying job that plumber's had to deal with in a long time, and would probably result in needing a new toilet.  The point of the wax ring is that it seals, but can be removed if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Unless you mean just around the lip, so dirt doesn't collect in the crease.  Then it's just a minor annoyance, and the plumber won't care much.  Nothing a box-cutter wouldn't solve.

       why dont we tell the politicians that unless the campaign is repeal the Fed Reserve Act, no votes.  Neither candadite will, made  sure none of the above is on the ballot.  Wilson made a secret deal with the bankers of the fed to sign the bill.  Lets make a public deal with those running the without the promise to do repeal it we vote no one in. None of the above on a ballot as an option has been upheld by higher courts.

       That might work if voting in federal elections meant anything anymore.  Voter turn-out has been steadily dropping as people lose faith and trust in, what are now, career politicians.  All of us in the US are quickly reaching a point where we either decide to get on board as government property or rebel and start a new country.  The unfortunate and inevitable results of oppression...

       Thanks for the advice, Im not the strongest speller and my english sucks.  Never good at it.  Never had an interest in it.  My strengths are math, science, history and am not as dumb as my writing skills portray me.  I also have a vast knowledge of the history you have to learn your self, and stong analitical skills to give me a good prospective as far as the big picture.  If you are voluenterring to proof read the english, I appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes its more important for me to get the thoughts out and hope that my mind didn't get too far ahead of my fingers.  It does happen though.  Most the time the message is understood, and I fully expect the occaisional visit from the grammar police.  Or spelling patrol.   But I dont take it personally, and I cant say your wrong.   Why dont you help out, instead of pointing it out.  You can get the jist of what I have to say, if the message is important, which I feel it is, edit it so that it is readable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It meant enough for you to say something.  Make sure if the message I say is important, or you feel it is, that it is coherent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not your job, but if rallying the people is the part your have taken an interest in, help out.  do it coherently.  You are a much better student of english that me.   If you have any questions as to what im saying, or cant follow it because of the grammer, ask.   Peace, thanks again for reminding me my english sucks.  Im smart enough to know, but......

       I like the way you think.  Take 5 min, send them all emails, subject: Get rid of the Federal Reserve.  Flood their inboxes, call their offices, you wont talk to them , but theyre secretaries will.  The higher amount of calls, the worse tim you give them, the more they will hear about it..  The secretarys day gets ruined, they will ruin the bosses.  Send snail mail, make sighs put them on the roads to their offices.  Git Rid of the Fed, or we get someone who will.  That better be your sole campaign message. Any other issues take a back seat to this and are distractions.

       The government constantly seeks to grow larger, like an organism. It needs energy (taxes) to feed on to make this happen. Inflation is a form of taxation. It allows the government to spend even more. Last I read, around 40% of the money it takes to fund government operations comes from simply printing more money. They could get rid of taxes completely if they did this to a larger extent but then their cover would be blown

       Because the federal reserve needs your money. The vampires need blood too keep them young. Everyone involved should be in front of a firing squad. Everyone. NSA, CIA, etc. All of the government death squads. All the black ops. The unnamed groups that murder Americans. These people are the reason the world hates us.

       I'm not looking for a debate, but IMHO unless and until we return to a more progressive tax structure, the great bulk of people, the bottom 90%, will continue towards something like indentured servitude. With our elected representatives being beholding to big money, it is not going to happen any time soon.
      </p>

       We prospered as a nation and a people best when the very richest were not allowed to hoard and speculate quite so much. When the money was kept in play for a larger percentage of people.

      <p>
       Let's try "trickle up" for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are always confounding variables, but IMHO history shows that a strongly progressive income tax does not hinder incentive or industry.

       Im well aware of that.  Just trying to elicite some justifiable rage and motavation to make the campaign issues of the up coming elections to focus on what the obvious problem is.  Democrat or Republican, it dont matter, there is one question that needs to be asked them.  Are you willing to draft legislation to repeal the FRA and vote yes to fix this?  To the President, are you willing to sign a bill repealing the FRA?  If the answer is NO, we got the wrong people running.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the Above can be on the ballot for an option.  Upheld by courts.  Every one of the tools in office need to go.  This is the core of all issues today.  We kill this head, the body will die.  At the least the other issues we need to deal with will be all down hill from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       All other issues that come up, hillary emails, ISIS, the distractions going on, are just that. Distractions, and the questions need to key on repealling the Federal Reserve Act, so we can get out of "debt" that is bs any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       These bankers need to be charged for the theft of this country, all interest paid on thier scam they pulled in 1913 should be repaid to the people, and the damage they have done using their power to manipulate the masses for profit, should also be criminal.  Lets pass that act, retroactively.  Why should the people continue to pay for the deal Wilson made with the devil because he wanted to be king for a day.  We owe for an eternity of debt because every dolloar to repay the Criminal bankers, is loaned at interest, so as I said, the US soul was sold from one mans quest for a few years of power, and the payment was a population forever enslaved and endebted to the ones who gave it to him.

       EDIT:  FYI - The language will be a bit harsh throughout this response - but that’s mostly because that’s just how I tend to/choose to communicate sometimes.  It’s not ultimately against YOU per se, so don’t take it too personally or get too offended (if offended at all).  I actually agree with the core sentiment of much of what you say - even if I may not be in direct agreement with various specifics.

       In other words, as per your own words here, you’re paying a lot of attention to the upcoming campaign issues, etc…I would say that’s doing it wrong.  We don’t
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       “the next election” to get any motivation.  If we don’t have that motivation as a citizenry already, then it doesn’t look like we’re going to get it.  Like I said, we’re at this point generally shiftless and eviscerated.

      <p>
       I would say there is NO question left to ask them.  They’ve already responded to every question about whether or not they’re going to help the public - and the answer is a definite and resounding
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       .  You’re talking like the girlfriend who just keeps and keeps on getting cheated on by her boyfriend yet keeps coming back and giving him “one more try”, and asks every time “are you
       <em>
        really and truly
       </em>
       going to be faithful to me this time?”
      </p>
      <p>
       No.  He isn’t.  He needed to be left after his first fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that’s what we generally are as a citizenry - desperate, weak, and pleading.  And still too many of us for some reason think that there is actually some sort of hope in the government.  There isn’t.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       You really feel you need to ask that question?  And then what’s gonna happen when he dances around the issue with a big smile on his face…or even says “Yes!  Absolutely!” and still nothing gets done?  What are you going to do when you/we for the UPTEENTH time get shown that the government doesn’t listen to the people?  You don’t know that the government doesn’t listen to the people already?  You need

       Come on, man!  This is a fucking bullshit response is what this is.  You don’t think we’ve had the wrong fucking people running for I don’t know HOW many decades already??
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, there is really no debate or “inquiry” that’s needed any longer.  We don’t need to “see” anything.  We should already KNOW - and if we don’t, then that just means we’re not paying attention.
      </p>

      <p>
       Correct - and there is no debate needed for this any longer.  It should already be known and understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only action is needed now, not any “lets wait and see” philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so long as we DON’T all act on it and act
       <em>
        together?
       </em>
       then we should really just STFU and keep taking that gubmint stick up the ass like good, little, quiescent sheep, because very little if anything will get done until we ALL act against the ills of the country and planet
       <em>
        together
       </em>
       .  Until that happens, lets not make any platitudes about any type of “debates” or whatever that we “should pay attention to in order to see how the government will act on such and such issue”.  We already KNOW how they will act.  We see it every day.

       Okay.  Yes.  Agreed.  The ONLY people that are going to be able to do that, however, are the CITIZENS THEMSELVES - and they/we will only be able to do that if we all put our problems aside and come together as one people.  Anything short of this, and these are all empty words spoken.

If by “us” you mean “the government” or any type of “authority” above the citizenry, then, again, you’re doing it way wrong and nothing will ever get done.  The “us” has to be you and me and ALL of us banding together as one united citizenry — one united people with no prejudice, with no racism, with no disparity or antagonism between us.  Otherwise nothing will get done and we will keep getting the run around from a government that has never really been on our side.

       If you work for one week and make $100 and that buys you four bags of groceries, but work next week, get $100 but then it only buys 3 1/2 bags of groceries, you're working for less. THAT'S how they rob you. Working for the same, getting paid the same but the VALUE of that money is decreased. They control the VALUE.

       Those in charge DO see it but they're also part of the ones making the profits. THAT's why they pretend it's something else

       Jews are not the problem, but the (political/Rothschild) Zionists are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Jewish people today are medern/moderat/secular Jews (they take the good and leave the bad).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, most of the "Jews" in power are (political/Rothschild) Zionists pretending to be Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jewish people and evil (political/Rothschild) Zionists are not the same thing! This above mentioned form of Zionism is a very racist, genocidal, greedy, self-serving, unsympathetic, sociopathic, psychopathic, and fundamental ideology. There are Zionists that are not claiming to be "Jewish", but "Christian" (faux Christian), such as the Bush Family and Biden. Many of the Zionists claim to be "Jewish", in part, to discredit any and all critics with a dismissive conversation ender by calling them "anti-Semites". Zionists that claim to be Jewish are about as Jewish as terrorists claiming to be Muslim (as in, not at all true to the (modern/secular/moderat) religions).
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the plan by these (political/Rothschild) Zionists that claim to be Jewish is to have the masses hate actual Jewish people and Israel for their atrocities; The average uninformed/missinformed person may mistake these Zionists as true Jewish people, and falsely blame humanist Jewish people for all of the atrocities of the Zionists (War, Coup de tats, Usery, human rights/constitutional defying laws/policies/actions, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       The three big (political/Rothschild) Zionist Occupied Governments (ZOGs) are the USA, the UK, and Israel. Many other countries are also controlled, owned, and operated by the Zionists (through Central banking, mega corporations that politically lobby federal politicians, mainstream media, etc.). Many USFG politicians have Israel-USA dual citizenships.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionist grid of power in a nutshell: The USA is Israels bitch, the USA, Israel, UK (and others) are the bitches of the (political/Rothschild) Zionists, and the Zionists are the bitches of the top-of-the-top of the Global Elites/Powers That Be (PTB)/Illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protip: When trying to denounce (political/Rothschild) Zionism and its ilk, for the love of God, do not use David Duke as a source! Duke may be right about the power of Zionism to an extent, but using Duke as a source probably discredits the Conspiracy/Truth/Dissent movement since Duke used to be a KKK Grand Wizard, is a white-supremacist, and is also not fond of Jewish people (even if they are humanist and not Zionists).

       (Political/Rothschild) Zionists control most of the worlds currencies, certain stock / stock markets, governments (through controlling the currencies, political lobbying, etc.), lend money to governments (including lending to the USA and Russia). Absolutely no entity has as much influence, power, money, resources, etc that these (political/Rothschild) Zionists, and related Global Elites around or above them have.

       Its not speculation. If you've been around this sub long enough, and have been a conspiracy researcher long enough, you would have found that many people, including credential people (such as international lawyers, politicians, etc.) have talked about (political/Rothschild) Zionism.

       That's the problem, every time there is a conspiracy i'm interested in it always leads back to blaming Zionists. I understand that to you this gives it credence, but for me it's just old boring news. The holocaust denial stuff is also not helping. I'm sure this is falling on deaf ears as there is a picture of Bibi in the side panel.

       Ok. Here's what I was "over simplifying"...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Historically, some cultures (e.g., Christianity in much of Medieval Europe, and Islam in many parts of the world today) have regarded charging any interest for loans as sinful.
        <sup>
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury">
          wikipedia:Usury
         </a>
        </sup>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of the "big 3" Abrahamic religions, which one isn't mentioned as being opposed to charging interest? Interest creates inflation when a nation-state must borrow its own money from a private banking institution which charges interest on that loan. If these loans are small, few, and far between and not the mainstay of that nation-state's finance, there is very little inflation. If, however, the entirety of a nation-state's financial structure is derived from the borrowing of its own money at interest, that financial system is in a constant state of causing inflation.
       <strong>
        constant
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The original question was...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        From 1776 to 1913 there was literally no inflation or debt minus fluxation during war time. Since 1913, I dont have enough room to type the debt [...] Why?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because of usury, implemented in the USA's financial structure in 1913, by Jews. I.e., the Jewish (Rothschild) practice of usury (Jewsury) creates inflation.

       Im well aware of that.  Just trying to elicite some justifiable rage and motavation to make the campaign issues of the up coming elections to focus on what the obvious problem is.  Democrat or Republican, it dont matter, there is one question that needs to be asked them.  Are you willing to draft legislation to repeal the FRA and vote yes to fix this?  To the President, are you willing to sign a bill repealing the FRA?  If the answer is NO, we got the wrong people running.

       None of the Above can be on the ballot for an option.  Upheld by courts.  Every one of the tools in office need to go.  This is the core of all issues today.  We kill this head, the body will die.  At the least the other issues we need to deal with will be all down hill from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       All other issues that come up, hillary emails, ISIS, the distractions going on, are just that. Distractions, and the questions need to key on repealling the Federal Reserve Act, so we can get out of "debt" that is bs any way.

       These bankers need to be charged for the theft of this country, all interest paid on thier scam they pulled in 1913 should be repaid to the people, and the damage they have done using their power to manipulate the masses for profit, should also be criminal.  Lets pass that act, retroactively.  Why should the people continue to pay for the deal Wilson made with the devil because he wanted to be king for a day.  We owe for an eternity of debt because every dolloar to repay the Criminal bankers, is loaned at interest, so as I said, the US soul was sold from one mans quest for a few years of power, and the payment was a population forever enslaved and endebted to the ones who gave it to him.

       A 5 year old knows not to make deals with the devil, the bill is always steep.  We will be forever paying for it unless we fix it.

       And they named schools after Wilson.  Dumbasses.

       Your making no sense. Interest cant pay off debt. I never even said anything about that. Explain yourself. Quit acting like your smarter than me or everyone else and state your point. I dont think you know shit and your mindset is stuck in a broken economic system. I'm talking about changing our current system. I dont need "smart" people to tell me whether or not build a new bridge because the old one is failing or building a new sewer system in a metropolitan area because the old system in failing. Acceptable rate of return doesnt even factor into that.
