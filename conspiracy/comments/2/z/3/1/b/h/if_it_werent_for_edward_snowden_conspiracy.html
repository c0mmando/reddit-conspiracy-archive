       So you're thanking a guy who at least previously worked for the CIA (and most likely still does) for making
       <em>
        conspiracy theories
       </em>
       validated, when it was the CIA who literally weaponized the term
       <em>
        conspiracy theory
       </em>
       as a PR campaign to cover up for the Warren Commission?

       Yes I realize that the positive effect of vindicating conspiracy theorists with the leaks can be seen as negated by the public's complacency of the leaks. I'm still saying OP isn't wrong.

       I believe that the importance of what Snowden did is enabling this information about mass surveillance to penetrate the mainstream.  Both mainstream media and mainstream people.  One thing I don't like on reddit is the whole 'get the meds' discourse.

       Hm.  I forgot I was on C.  Ok.  Let me explain my view. I just read about panopticon on conspiracy.archives.  Interesting. You do realise that people have, in general,  positive attitude toward secret services and believe they are the force of good.  They might  be so or may not,  irrelevant in this case. After Snowden revelations people are not just being sheepish but: raising their voices for example Wikipedia v NSA, or  check Google trends and cross reference search for encryption v Snowden revelations. I like events that raise general awarnes about inner workings by agencies on people's data.  Think Snowden did that perfectly.

       So the idea is, if I understand you correctly - we will let them know they are watched in order to make them live in fear and self censor themselves. Isn't that allowing people, the fact that now they know they are being watched, the advantage of actually: fighting back with encryption, tor, using dark Web.  Using digital tools to fight back in order to reclaim their privacy. The answer is in the eye of beholder. If you are right thinking people will only self censor and not rebel than it was hopeless from the very begining.

       My point exactly.  Read my previous comment again.  I was quoting you. My point is that within your way of thinking both Snowden's action and George_tenet's action have the same effect. This is because knowing that ES revelations are a limited hangout or not knowing it have according to you the same effect of self sensorship.  Therefore you are a part of conspiracy.  Within your reasoning. Or at least your actions have the same effect as the one coming from conspirators.

       Oh. I see what you mean. But, no.  I could argue to The masses about other CIA ops forthe purpose of education. If people learn about lhs, and then think Snowden is, maybe they just wont care about tptb and try and do xactly what they dont want,and thats spreading info

       I used to be one of those people that made fun of truthers / conspiracy theorists.  It was the Snowden leaks that woke me up.  I can only imagine that there are MANY others like me.  I get the Snowden limited hangout theory, but I think that if the Snowden leaks are a limited hangout then it totally backfired.

       Right, I get that.  In a "soft" police state where ppl don't know, one doesn't get the same chilling effect on dissent.
       <del>
        But I really don't think the Snowden leaks have had a chilling effect on dissent.  It's caused the ranks of dissenters to swell IMHO.

       I actually find our response by large to be incredibly disappointing. Certain apps have caught a lot of flack but not much more seems to be happening. How have we not totally abandon all apple smart-phones by now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either a lot of us don't care we're being recorded or just have little desire to do much about it. If nothing else, Snowden's leak has revealed Americans
       <strong>
        can
       </strong>
       embrace mass surveillance with little to no push back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm almost to the point of thinking most this information coming out the past couple years is deliberately being released in small doses in order to gauge reaction and set up the next grab for power. A lot of this information has been available for decades but seemed so sinister no one would want to believe it, never mind the insane person who provided it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's being released, I've witnessed many either shutting down in contemplation (totally understandable) or displaying disgust and eventually feeling a little overwhelmed. I feel a lot of us simply don't know what do to other than ditch the apparent violators and that isn't such a good thing :(

       It's still quite good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that being aware of the "police state" can allow self-censorship but that doesn't mean that it's ineffective if the public is unaware. In fact people could be more unconscious of what they divulge if they're unaware. You'd think that would allow them to be better incriminated and targeted because they didn't self-censor out of fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly see both sides as effective.

       Well by simple inference  of circus and bread (This is while drunk) I can only assume you mean that by circus you are stating that the leakage of files from the CIA database are the peanuts and the bread you stated is simply life sustaining form for natural and pure ordination then  yes, circle and bread.

       It's a phrase that was used by Juvenal during the declining days of the Roman Empire, if memory serves.

      <p>
       A basic definition from Webster: something, as extravagant entertainment, offered as an expedient means of pacifying discontent or diverting attention from a source of grievance.

       ES was paraded as a young, innocent pawn, living in Paradise with his Pole Dancing GF, caught up in something sooo
       <em>
        Big
       </em>
       . Put on display! Come! Eat! Enjoin!
      </p>
      <p>
       There were others, well before him, that didn't
       <em>
        whore themselves
       </em>
       and Russ Tice is a prime example. If you don't know about Russ Tice or the others, prior to ES, I encourage you to research.

       You most certainly can't take anything at face value.  Just because my eyes are open doesn't mean I'm ready to hop on any train that comes through.  I do what research I feel is good enough for me in order to validate or dismiss things.  Anyway.  Yeah.  I don't post much.

       No that's not true, Edward Snowden hasn't revealed anything that wasn't already publically disclosed.  I mean Patriot Act alone covers 99% of what Snowden talks about and it has been public record since day one.

       Right, I get that.  In a "soft" police state where ppl don't know, one doesn't get the same chilling effect on dissent.
       <del>
        But I really don't think the Snowden leaks have had a chilling effect on dissent.  It's caused the ranks of dissenters to swell IMHO.

       It's still quite good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that being aware of the "police state" can allow self-censorship but that doesn't mean that it's ineffective if the public is unaware. In fact people could be more unconscious of what they divulge if they're unaware. You'd think that would allow them to be better incriminated and targeted because they didn't self-censor out of fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly see both sides as effective.

       My point exactly.  Read my previous comment again.  I was quoting you. My point is that within your way of thinking both Snowden's action and George_tenet's action have the same effect. This is because knowing that ES revelations are a limited hangout or not knowing it have according to you the same effect of self sensorship.  Therefore you are a part of conspiracy.  Within your reasoning. Or at least your actions have the same effect as the one coming from conspirators.
