    <div class="md"><p>Hm.  I forgot I was on C.  Ok.  Let me explain my view. I just read about panopticon on conspiracy.archives.  Interesting. You do realise that people have, in general,  positive attitude toward secret services and believe they are the force of good.  They might  be so or may not,  irrelevant in this case. After Snowden revelations people are not just being sheepish but: raising their voices for example Wikipedia v NSA, or  check Google trends and cross reference search for encryption v Snowden revelations. I like events that raise general awarnes about inner workings by agencies on people&#39;s data.  Think Snowden did that perfectly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the idea is, if I understand you correctly - we will let them know they are watched in order to make them live in fear and self censor themselves. Isn&#39;t that allowing people, the fact that now they know they are being watched, the advantage of actually: fighting back with encryption, tor, using dark Web.  Using digital tools to fight back in order to reclaim their privacy. The answer is in the eye of beholder. If you are right thinking people will only self censor and not rebel than it was hopeless from the very begining. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point exactly.  Read my previous comment again.  I was quoting you. My point is that within your way of thinking both Snowden&#39;s action and George_tenet&#39;s action have the same effect. This is because knowing that ES revelations are a limited hangout or not knowing it have according to you the same effect of self sensorship.  Therefore you are a part of conspiracy.  Within your reasoning. Or at least your actions have the same effect as the one coming from conspirators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually find our response by large to be incredibly disappointing. Certain apps have caught a lot of flack but not much more seems to be happening. How have we not totally abandon all apple smart-phones by now? </p>

<p>Either a lot of us don&#39;t care we&#39;re being recorded or just have little desire to do much about it. If nothing else, Snowden&#39;s leak has revealed Americans <strong>can</strong> embrace mass surveillance with little to no push back.</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost to the point of thinking most this information coming out the past couple years is deliberately being released in small doses in order to gauge reaction and set up the next grab for power. A lot of this information has been available for decades but seemed so sinister no one would want to believe it, never mind the insane person who provided it.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s being released, I&#39;ve witnessed many either shutting down in contemplation (totally understandable) or displaying disgust and eventually feeling a little overwhelmed. I feel a lot of us simply don&#39;t know what do to other than ditch the apparent violators and that isn&#39;t such a good thing :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s still quite good. </p>

<p>I understand that being aware of the &quot;police state&quot; can allow self-censorship but that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s ineffective if the public is unaware. In fact people could be more unconscious of what they divulge if they&#39;re unaware. You&#39;d think that would allow them to be better incriminated and targeted because they didn&#39;t self-censor out of fear.</p>

<p>I honestly see both sides as effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point exactly.  Read my previous comment again.  I was quoting you. My point is that within your way of thinking both Snowden&#39;s action and George_tenet&#39;s action have the same effect. This is because knowing that ES revelations are a limited hangout or not knowing it have according to you the same effect of self sensorship.  Therefore you are a part of conspiracy.  Within your reasoning. Or at least your actions have the same effect as the one coming from conspirators. </p>
