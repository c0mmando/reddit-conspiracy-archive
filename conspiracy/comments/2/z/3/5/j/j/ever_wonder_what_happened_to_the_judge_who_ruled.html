       This case really burns me. So I been stewing over it finally looked up some of the post sentencing goings on. WTF! SHE GOT PROMOTED DEC. 2014. Looking at her rulings she seems opposite of liberal denying most motions from defendants. Well except for Dupont. Dupont seems to own most of fricken Delaware. Plus very charitable. She is now the highest superior court judge in the state. Seems riddled with conspiracy. Any thoughts or more info?

       I got downvoted by paeddit in r/news for pointing this out a while ago that this judge got promoted for protecting a rapist paedophile. Go figure.

       This is what Fascism looks like.  They have a different set of rules that applies to them.  Doesn't get ANY MORE OBVIOUS with "rulings" like this, and after effects like this.

       Even judges have to go along to get along; and if they go along, they can get along very well. I recall wondering at the time what more there was to the defendant than simply being a DuPont; with regard to secret societies and such. Didn't care enough to follow it up though.

       The self-appointed rulers own the judges and courts so secret societies are more or less redundant.
