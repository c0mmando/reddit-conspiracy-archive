       Is the US the "template" for the NWO? Is it because the country was supposed to be a
       <em>
        democracy
       </em>
       in the beginning (even though it really wasn't)? the figures in this are dated 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Quick Facts:
Most developed nations do not fluoridate their water. In western Europe, for example, only 3% of the population consumes fluoridated water.
      </p>
      <p>
       While 25 countries have water fluoridation programs, 11 of these countries have less than 20% of their population consuming fluoridated water: Argentina (19%), Guatemala (13%), Panama (15%), Papa New Guinea (6%), Peru (2%), Serbia (3%), Spain (11%), South Korea (6%), the United Kingdom (11%), and Vietnam (4%).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only 11 countries in the world have more than 50% of their population drinking fluoridated water: Australia (80%), Brunei (95%); Chile (70%), Guyana (62%), Hong Kong (100%), the Irish Republic (73%), Israel (70%), Malaysia (75%), New Zealand (62%), Singapore (100%), and the United States (64%).
      </p>
      <p>
       In total, 377,655,000 million people worldwide drink artificially fluoridated water. This represents 5% of the worldâ€™s population.
There are more people drinking fluoridated water in the United States than the rest of the world combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no difference in tooth decay between western nations that fluoridate their water and those that do not."

      <p>
       Because the US is the biggest, most disruptive country on the planet, and if the citizenry were to ever wake up to find out how much power they have and they
       <em>
        stop
       </em>
       this country, a
       <em>
        huge

       vacuum of power will open up that TPTB do not want.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of it is about control, and TPTB want to keep/hold on to it.  Gotta keep the citizens dumbed down and bridled for that to continue.

       Fluoridation of drinking water is a post WWII phenomenon; entirely American in origin. It's bad enough in its own right, without adding Nazis and Bolsheviks. Just replace them with Rockefellers; and Rothschilds I guess, as UK didn't have to be coerced, and was on-board more-or-less instantly.

       Ikr. It's also funny how they think America is a dictatorship and we can't see it because of fluoride, but there are plenty of far worse governments that don't use fluoride in their water, yet there is no revolution there...

       Its a victim complex. But I also think that they find solace in the fact that there is some controlling force in everything.

       When in reality
       <strong>
        no one knows what the fuck is going on

       Sometimes, I entertain that idea. I.e., that actually no one knows what's going on, that all the anomalies are caused by some unknown force. A group? A secret society? Mind-parasitizing aliens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if everyone, right to the very top of the chain, just doesn't know what's going on!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's often said that people latch on to conspiracy theories because they can't handle the truth that it's "just chaos". Well, to look at reality and try to superimpose the idea that it's just chaos leads to an utterly paranoid mind, a mindset of "total conspiracy", and that's a rabbit hole that can lead you to a mental institution.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, maybe you're right. Maybe this goes further up than anything it's even possible for us to imagine. That would mean I have no control. Actually, there's some comfort in that. Certainly makes me feel less responsible!

       Won't save the food you buy from being sprayed. Even with organic you've got ways for pesticides, herbicides, fluoride to bleed into neighbouring crops.
I have a vegetable garden and I made the mistake of watering it with the hose and paused and went "...oh. Fuck!".

       <em>
        intentionally

       harm? I mean

        it just looks like a controversial topic

       . Not one for projecting an idea of the 'New World Order'. What benefit would they come into for adding a relatively minute amount of a substance to the water supply, where it isn't already naturally occuring.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even care as to debate the benefits/risks of fluoridated water, I'd just like some proof that the 'Illuminati' (or whatever myth you think is behind the NWO) is behind the addition of fluoride in all of these countries.

       Equivocating. I was not aware that fluoride intake was vital for human survival. Yes you can beat around the truth all you want. I just dont see how any logical human being would willingly take fluoride, let alone be relatively forced to consume it.

       Never said it was. I just fulfilled the criteria the previous poster put up, using another chemical. And you're forced a lot more to use oxygen rather than fluoride.

       No, I'm not able
       <em>
        to prove
       </em>
       this on my own and true, it is definitely controversial, considering that all countries do not use fluoride, I always wondered why.  The articles/link below by no means
       <em>
        proves
       </em>
       that fluoride
       <em>

       needed, but I see no reason to add any additional chemical to the water supply, especially if it may not be healthful.

      <p>
       "As with some other countries water fluoridation in the United States is a contentious issue. As of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water fluoridation. On January 25, 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first community in the United States to fluoridate its drinking water to prevent tooth decay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoridation became an official policy of the U.S. Public Health Service by 1951, and by 1960 water fluoridation had become widely used in the U.S., reaching about 50 million people."

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "What are fluoride's health effects?
Exposure to excessive consumption of fluoride over a lifetime may lead to increased likelihood of bone fractures in adults, and may result in effects on bone leading to pain and tenderness. Children aged 8 years and younger exposed to excessive amounts of fluoride have an increased chance of developing pits in the tooth enamel, along with a range of cosmetic effects to teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This health effects language is not intended to catalog all possible health effects for fluoride. Rather, it is intended to inform consumers of some of the possible health effects associated with fluoride in drinking water."

       Okay I'm Irish and my drinking water isn't artificailly fluoridated, so I have no interest in this discussion..

       But I'd seriously like you to discuss how you made the link between fluoridation and a NWO. And also what they would stand to gain. Surely if they wanted to poison the US population, they are incredibly incompetent.

       Conspiracy theorists think the reason for fluoridated water is to dumb down the population &amp; make people susceptible to illness; of course it's not the sole cause, there's also -- tv, music &amp; to some extent movies (dumbing down, promoting propaganda). This can lead to other subjects, so I'm trying not to go "off track",

       but I think you have realize that fluoride isn't just in the water, any drink that contains water probably has it and if you know anything of the American diet, you can be sure it's not good (i.e., fast foods &amp; GMO).

       My god that is absurd. Nothing you supplied backs up the idea that it 'dumbs people down'. So that's where you go from some credible sources to Alex Fucking Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got to ask also.. If 'they' are in control of everything, why are there states that have changed the mandate of water fluoridation? Surely a ruling class that are testing creating a NWO wouldn't stand for that shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also got to throw in, because you mentioned it. GMO's are not inherently bad. Its quite the contrary. Its the reason that we can feed as many people as we can. While, yes, research should be ongoing to the effects on GMO's, there is nothing credible to support that it is a conspiracy or even detrimental to health.

       Not trying to persuade you to agree &amp; it doesn't matter to me, I prefer no fluoride, no GMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Published in the Journal of Environmental Health recently was a major study finding states with a higher portion of artificially fluoridated water had a higher prevalence of ADHD. This comes after the highly publicized Harvard study assessing the impact of fluoride on the neurological development in children â€“ finding that fluoride lowers IQ.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of February 2015, there are a collection of nearly 50 studies investigating the relationship between fluoride and human intelligence. From those 50 studies, 43 have found that elevated fluoride exposure is associated with reduced IQ and data further showing that fluoridation disproportionally harms low-income and minority communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this why so many nations around the world donâ€™t fluoridate their water? Is this why so many communities are halting water fluoridation?"

       What is "proof"? If you want Dozens of studies that show Fluoride is harmful then they exist.
      </p>

       This study for example shows fluoride's negative effects on the neuro-development of children's brains.

       Holy shit do you people not read? I said I'm not interested in discussing the health effects. Its not in my drinking water, couldn't care less.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was wanting them to address
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       this would be a 'template' for the New World Order. Where this connection comes from, and what they would stand to gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do think you said it well, the government have probably made a mistake and won't go back on it. Its not the first time, and
       <em>
        certainly
       </em>
       doesn't indicate fucking Illuminati.

       Fluoridation of drinking water is a post WWII phenomenon; entirely American in origin. It's bad enough in its own right, without adding Nazis and Bolsheviks. Just replace them with Rockefellers; and Rothschilds I guess, as UK didn't have to be coerced, and was on-board more-or-less instantly.
