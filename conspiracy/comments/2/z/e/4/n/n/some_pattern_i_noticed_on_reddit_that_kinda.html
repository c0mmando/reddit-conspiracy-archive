       So I'm assuming we're all familiar with "targeted" attacks: trolls, derailing conversations, mocking, always raising the bar, ad hominem, etc etc. as seen here:
       <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">
        https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That obviously has its problems when trying to reach a big number of people so what they do is create communities and invest their time there, attracting unaware teenagers and ignorant people who can then conduct their attack for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best examples of course
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       <a href="/r/subredditdrama">
        /r/subredditdrama
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another strange pattern is if you check the mods on those type of subreddits you can see how they almost always are mods of 60+ other subreddits

       When debating 9/11 or JFK say, I actually like the trolls coming after me. It helps to read what kind of lies they spin just to hear all the arguments. 
I know arguing with trolls is fruitless but I need to read their propaganda so I can protect other people against it,
whilst subsequently preparing myself for all the questions, and all the angles, and all the garbage they can throw in future.

       I've noticed another pattern with trolls here over the years. It seems like most of them have very little or no link karma compared to the amount of comment karma. That doesn't apply to those that use an
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       dedicated account, only those that use the same account sitewide.

       Its not always an effort to silence people, often the idea or statement a user made is enough to mock them, without needing a mod to direct an so called "attack".
      </p>
      <p>
       Im a user of both subs you mentioned, and i mock or dislike or laugh about insane ideas or statements. Why? Cause sometimes people need to be reminded, the world doesnt work often like you think it does. Not everyone disliking your opinion is a organised shill to directly discredit you or others opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its always claimed, that people here have an open mind. Im lurking here, cause sometimes interesting things get posted, and most of the time its answered after a while, why or what was the "true"  cause of something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every opinion should be looked at, if you think, you hold the truth, you are going to fail and think, everything is against me and want to have me silenced. Be open for every idea, and think critical of it.

       Im not really in those things, mostly posting to smaller subs, but i had never problems voicing my opinion in any sub. Again, probably im not the user of subs that are "cancer", but those things are often side effects of boards, were you can connect a opinion or statement to a username with his previously posted opinions and so on. That leads to ad hominem bans, which leads to hate of specific mods, which also leads to hate of whole subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the often said argument: dont take reddit so serious. I like to discuss on here, but its managed by mods, who are people with own opinions,there will be unjustified bans. If you really care about that stuff to devote a whole sub to it, someone should take a step back and ask themselves, why he should care that much. But thats all IMO.
