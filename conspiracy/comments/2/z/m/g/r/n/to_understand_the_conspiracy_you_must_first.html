        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>99% of people give away their power. It&#39;s actually &#39;normal&#39; and expected that you do so. The individual who takes full responsibility for creating his reality is exceptionally rare. </p>

<p>Why? Because responsibility is terrifying at first. It&#39;s a mind fuck to admit that you are the cause of your suffering and that, on some level, you actually like the pain. 
You are not as rational as you might think. We all assume that we want to be happy and productive, so we tend to view things like depression, anxiety, unfulfilling careers, abusive relationships, addiction, and general boredom as random/not of our own creation. I mean, who would choose to suffer, right?</p>

<p>Wrong. Your thoughts, actions, decisions, etc. reflect deeply held beliefs about yourself and the world at large. Pay attention. Almost nothing is random. You feel disempowered deep down? Guess what, you&#39;re going to make decisions every day that reaffirm this belief until you become a slave. Sorry, but that&#39;s the truth. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t intend for this post to be depressing in the slightest. We are here to LEARN and GROW. However, you must understand that if you won&#39;t take responsibility, someone else will. For every 100 people who choose to exist in a semi-conscious trance in order to avoid their problems, there is one guy who is fully conscious and thus can see what you&#39;re about. He will be able to manipulate you if he wants. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t stress this enough: responsibility is RARE. You need to imagine your perfect reality and go for it. You need to separate from the pack, ruthlessly and objectively analyze your personal belief system, and start balling out. If you do this, you gain energy, awareness, and become very strong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an important topic and should be voted to the top page and discussed. So many people focus on posting news that distracts from the real problem, the enemy within.</p>

<p>Im working on a <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/productions/only-enemy-within">documentary</a> that you reminded me I need to finish under the same name.</p>

<p>I learned about this topic when I was working on myself about 15 years ago. If you dont know who you are, you can and will be manipulated by someone who does. This is the reason propaganda works, it taps into unconscious fears and beliefs. In fact a lot of posts I see here about conspiracies do just that, tap into peoples unconsiousness to keep people off balance and distracted allowing the big illusion continue. Its important that you look at information in such a way as to allow it to show you who you are, instead of showing you who someone or some country is that makes your world the way it is. Our reality is for the most part an extension of our beliefs. If you dont know yourself you can have beliefs that are unconscious. Unconscious beliefs can be used against you. Its one of the main reasons people do things without knowing why and usually find themselves in trouble.</p>

<p>Very important point, you have to reclaim energy that you have given to situations and people that dont support you by making an inventory of what you do in situations (Stressfull or not) and take a look at what you can cut out of your life. Then start to make small adjustments, stop hanging out with a specific person that makes you ill, or stop smoking because it makes you fell unwell as an example. Little by little you will start saving energy that will help you move in the direction you want to go. </p>

<p>Well, no. You are wrong by definition. And I think you misunderstand what science actually is.. To put it simply, it is a way to build a model that explains the natural world. Not a set it stone belief system. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got a model to better explain something that was thought previously? Fantastic! Scientists love to have their ideas challenged or changed <em>its their job</em>.</p>

<p>To be truthful I&#39;m not totally sure what you were trying to convey with that part. That we can make things happen within the universe? I mean, we are part of the universe so I&#39;m not sure how that is supposed to challenge current scientific beliefs, care to elaborate?</p>

Then when you decide to play this game with real authenticity you wiped your mind before you pressed start but after you get the game over or your character dies you then have full remembrance that you created the game and it was just something you did to pass the time (eternity). You have also been every pixel in the game every NPC every rock tree and river etc... hope you get it and why the double slit SCIENCE experiment proves you are the player in the game you alter reality by your presence.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that your reasoning is very poor here. That or the articulation of the idea is misleading. No matter what you design or how immersive your game world may be, you do not <em>become</em> that world. You are simply a piece of code that has learned experience. We are not what we create, I think that is fairly reasonable.</p>

<p>As for our existance altering reality, I&#39;d like you to define what you mean by, &#39;altering reality&#39; because so far it sounds incoherant. If you mean that we can change that which goes on around us, sure, we can do that. But almost any atom in existance does the same thing, or will at some stage. The other explaination I can imagine is that we are altering a constant of reality, and you&#39;ll need to go into further detail on that one.</p>

<p>I simply don&#39;t see how you correlate your anecdote and a quantum probability experiment. What explaination are you using to tie the two together? </p>

<p>And to say that we have intellegence, therefore we must have an intelligent creator is a religious creationist argument. It simply begs the question, who created your creator?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your previous post was guilded twice with similar ramblings. Its not like I could tell how many upvotes this would get. And my saying its being lapped up was based on the circle jerk of the comments. Ego stroking, having &#39;higher levels of awareness&#39; etc.</p>

<p>Telling people that the negative feelings/things in their life is their own fault, that&#39;s simply wrong. Depression isn&#39;t as simple as choosing to be sad day in day out. And who the fuck are you to say that an outside influence can&#39;t be to blame? </p>

<p>As for your take on following a leader, have you ever watched how primates socialize? There is a heirarchy. Its engrained into us, its how we succeed, by working together in a social manner.</p>

<p>What you are saying is probably good for some sort of self help book, but it has no bearing on being &#39;awake&#39;. There is zero correlation between mental health and believing that &#39;they&#39; are out there, controlling the media, governments, poisoning your water, spraying your air, bringing down your own nation&#39;s buildings and staging elaborate hoaxs every month or so.</p>

<p>I would say that paranoia is pretty far from being mentally healthy.</p>

Its simply a practical idea to help you change your awareness. It does not make me feel like I am better than other people. I have a long way to go.</p>

<p>When you throw around accusations like Ramblings, expect hostility. If that&#39;s what you want in your life, that&#39;s what you will get.
Depression starts with a choice which develops over time, it is in fact a choice as you react to your surroundings. Understanding that now, in the moment allows you to make a choice to change it. When you take responsibility of how you react to your surroundings you do realize you have a choice on how you want to perceive things</p>

<p>What you are saying is probably good for some sort of self help book, but it has no bearing on being &#39;awake&#39;. There is zero correlation between mental health and believing that &#39;they&#39; are out there, controlling the media, governments, poisoning your water, spraying your air, bringing down your own nation&#39;s buildings and staging elaborate hoaxs every month or so.</p>

<p>Can you offer up a citation for that? Quite often it can be a chemical imbalance in your brain, can that be remedied by &#39;choosing&#39; to be happy?</p>

<p>The things I mentioned are just the tip of the iceberg of the conspiracies, and none a of my own belief or fabrication. So let&#39;s be pendantic then. You are <em>both</em> asserting that to comprehend what <em>really</em> goes on, you need to be in good mental health. <strong>What complete fucking nonsense.</strong> That is pulled straight from your ass. I don&#39;t even know where to start with how ridiculous that sounds... But just go over it in your head a few times and see if it makes sense to you after a few minutes. </p>

<p>Dude. Of course poor mental health is going to lower your ability to comprehend reality: that&#39;s the whole point. Are you trying to argue that people locked up in psych wards are thinking clearly?
Look, I&#39;ve battled depression myself and totally empathize. But I can tell you from experience that 1) there&#39;s no actual science behind the chemical imbalance theory. I&#39;ve been told this by multiple doctors. 2) Of course your brain produces less happy chemicals when you&#39;re making shitty decisions and putting yourself in bad situations. That&#39;s natural. </p>

<p>Believing that depression is solely caused by chemical imbalances out of your control is basically saying &quot;I was born with a defective brain and there&#39;s no cure for it.&quot; Do you ACTUALLY believe that? If you did, wouldn&#39;t you frantically be searching for solutions??</p>
