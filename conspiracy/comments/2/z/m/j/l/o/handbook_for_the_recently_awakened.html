<p>I need all of your help. If we were to have a manual and cover the most important subjects of the most important things to pass on to our fellow brothers and sisters, what would it be and please provide your sources. I was ordained by the author of a book that woke me up to write a book. I will promise that every user that I use their info for will be cited in the book and any money made will be shared with all contributors that are used in the book. I have tried to have the book, which was free and woke me up, given to 50 people NOT ONE SOUL read it but my wife. This is why I will charge for it.</p>

<p>I will have these as themes:
Spirituality, Purpose, Slavery (duh), Conspiracy, Freedom and how to attain it, How to educate yourself etc..</p>

<p>Please feel free to go as deep or as weird as you want. The book I read literally had real life butterflies appear in my daily life every day for a year and I still see them weekly. (Butterflies are free to fly).</p>

<p>Thank you all in advance for your submissions.</p>

<p>One of the more infuriating aspects of some posts here is the automatic denigration and/or insulting of people who don&#39;t share the same interests. This can be avoided really easily by keeping the language clear and neutral. Stops you looking like a loon, too.</p>

<p>I wrote the author back with some &quot;fixes&quot; or where I thought he went wrong. He told me to kill the Buddha and write a book myself this was a long time ago but I have a strong need to write a book literally 2-5 people per week say &quot;You should write a book&quot;. </p>

<p>If you like I will freely give you the book to present on your website. </p>

<p>I do not want to rehash anything from his book but present it in my words. The issue I am coming up with is selecting the most important topics. Please remember back when you were waking up and find the key things that made you awaken more or were important to you.</p>

I&#39;m not going to censor myself because... why do i care what others think when i think they&#39;re stupid anyways. If shit does go down and i die, then i die. Yea it&#39;s sad but really, if there&#39;s somewhere to go after death, I&#39;ll be plenty distracted. If there isn&#39;t i won&#39;t know or care and if reincarnation is true then i have a whole different life to live. There&#39;s never any good in pretending to be something you&#39;re not. I&#39;ve quit jobs over it. left friends because of it. Kicked habits, etc.</p>

<p>It blows my mind when people on here say they don&#39;t express their true feelings. It&#39;s never worth it and it compounds your problems.</p>

<p>To quote that god awful movie, &quot;let it go&quot;</p>

<p>And to quote nwa &quot;express yourself&quot;</p>

<p>Be happy, gratefu,l and content. Focus on what you have instead of what you don&#39;t. Love what is, don&#39;t hate it for what it isn&#39;t.</p>

Pretty much every conspiracy theorist I know personally has paranoid delusional thinking, hallucinations, and obsessive fixations as symptoms of misunderstood but ruinous if untreated psychological disorders, such as schizophrenia. You yourself see imaginary butterflies? </p>

<p>&#39;Waking up&#39; to me usually sounds like the onset of some manic psychosis. Much conspiracy theorist literature and resources seem to actively undermine people&#39;s mental health by reinforcing  delusional thinking. It is a legitimate concern of mine, as I have close family and friends who have degenerated terribly after starting our &#39;skeptical.&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are real butterflies verifiable by my wife, child, sister phone camera etc.. yeah it may be hard to believe but I have seen every possible color except for purple. It is you with deluded thinking. I&#39;ve had friends say okay dude sure thing brother and then they come over and see them. Delusional people would not think that this an extremely odd occurrence for starters. I realize this is a strange phenomenon, I know it is hard to believe. I&#39;m perplexed as much as the next person,  crazy delusional people can&#39;t get hallucinations on camera. They also cannot have their hallucinations or delusions spread to others especially skeptical others about my claims. What saddens and frightens me more than random beautiful events like this is the knee-jerk reactions to question my mental health versus considering that the possibility of what this means. That the creator or some other force is woven into the world and based on consciousness you can affect even other lifeforms based on thought patterns. Before all this I was atheist left brained and probably would have written a rebuttal such as yours to a claim such as mine. The last family gathering on my patio had about 5 sightings of butterflies during the 4 hour event. That&#39;s my 70 year old father his wife my older and younger sister, niece and nephew wife child and my sisters&#39; daughter. That&#39;s quite a mass hallucination my friend they too were skeptical about my claims as should any rational adult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things that float by you offering a calming presence is a common side effect of some brain chemical imbalances. I have a friend who has an orb fairy buddy around. Perhaps you see some butterflies sometimes and connect them with an underlying pattern but butterflies are always flying around gardens minding their own business being cute to everybody, they got nothing to do with you they wild animals. </p>

<p>A book about spirituality and all that sounds lovely but your butterfly talk is somewhat disconcerting. Never feel wrong about seeing a psychiatrist or therapist sometime, everyone should treat their brain like anything else that gets occasional check ups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m speaking truth no more no less. In the 5 months that I lived in this house I saw 3 butterflies  (photographic memory). Your worship of mental health professionals who deem what is possible in this reality is more concerning to me than a man seeing butterflies. I&#39;m not seeing things they are as real as can be.</p>

<p>Man has lost its connection with God (true nature) when the connection is strengthened things like butterflies appearing  (not out of the blue) out of nature naturally is but the tip of the iceberg. I will go outside today and take a pic and post it to an email or upload of your choice so you may inspect the RAW data.</p>

<p>Howdy. Cheers for the compliment.</p>

<p>Certainly haven&#39;t been well-received but that&#39;s neither surprising nor interesting.</p>

<p>What it can be is annoying. Haven&#39;t posted much recently aside from the odd sarcastic BLARGH because if you&#39;re in negative subreddit karma posting is limited to once every ten minutes. It makes discussion almost impossible to everyone but the long-term underemployed.</p>

<p>Point is, you can make a well-reasoned (if contrarian) argument that ensures a constant posting limit, or a snarky jibe at a well-worn target that gets upvoted to on high.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s just reddit, that&#39;s not surprising. What might help is the removal of the karma-based posting limit for this subreddit. There might be almost 300K subscribers, but it&#39;s usually the same old crows commenting. Ah well.</p>

<p><a href="/u/Drytruth">/u/Drytruth</a> might be being sarcastic, snide and generally unhelpful, but rounding on track records/reputations isn&#39;t a great way to be. Ignore usernames and argue the content. If there&#39;s no argument, ignore it.</p>

<p>Then don&#39;t argue. Have conversations. Tone and sarcasm do not translate well to a medium such as this, so be as straight forward as you can and before you hit &#39;send,&#39; ask yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does this sound like an argument or a discussion? What will the other person think of this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m all for an internet argument every once in awhile, but at this point know all to well it won&#39;t be positive or fruitful once concluded. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly, trying to help them results in harassment, downvotes, etc. And lack of background makes things tough, as well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe part of your specific issue here is you state you are trying to <em>help</em>, but snarky comments calling those that are passionate about chemtrails or any other decisive issue (9/11 comes to mind) do not help. These people do not want help (most of the time), but want things to make sense and come here to bounce ideas off of us and have them peer reviewed, in a way. Change your mentality change your approach, and I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As a university professor I can assure you this may be common, but is no means the rule. Plenty of students think they know it all on day 1. The comparison may not be apt, but I would argue where ever one comes to learn is a an opportunity to teach. And if you haven&#39;t already, look up the history and etymology of the word &#39;school.&#39; Very interesting.</p>
