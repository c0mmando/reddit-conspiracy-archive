    <div class="md"><p>From the office of the President of the United States</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With Russia&#39;s recent cyber attack against our major financial institutions, including the theft if untold sums of money,  and the power vested in my through the War Powers Act, I hereby declare a state of Financial Emergency.</p>

<p>Through it&#39;s callous and deceitful tactics, the Russian Federation and agents associated with it have been implicated in liquidating assets in a variety of small, community banks, which has shown to create a run on all banks.</p>

<p>As of this moment, all financial institutions will be closed for an extended holiday. The Federal Reserve is working closely with the Department of the Treasury to formulate a relief package, but it will take time.</p>

<p>As a stopgap - some depositors funds will be initially used to soften this blow to our economy, and all of our own manufacturing and service  industries to proceed with minimal disruption.</p>

<p>I have met with both the Joint Chiefs and Congressional leadership this evening, and we agree that aggressive action is necessary to curb the Russian Federation&#39;s thirst for territory and hunger for power and resources. As evidence of the last few years, we have seen the Russian Federation&#39;s actions the former Soviet republics of Chechnya, where the Boston Bombers were trained, to Georgia, and most recently culminating with the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. This is just not a taste of things to come, but a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>Congress is busy working through the night to draft an Authorization for the Use of Military Force, which will include provisions for the immediate withdrawal of support for all Russian-owned and Russian-based corporations and persons connected to the Internet and other global communication services. The Pacific Fleet has been mobilized, and Japan, Australia, and South Korea stand firm with us in that particular part of the world.</p>

<p>UN Ambassador Power is working with the general Assembly to craft legislation condemning and imposing harsher sanctions against the Federation, and NATO troops are on the move to Kiev to reinforce the loyalist forces to fight Russian backed separatists with the rigor and fierceness associated with American military might.</p>

<p>Only a strategic pull out of <em>all forces</em> in Crimea, the DHK, LHK, and Donbass will be seen as a move to de-escalate the situation. For too long, the actions of Mr. Putin&#39;s regime have gone unchallenged. From Russian spies being arrested in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/27/us/new-york-alleged-russian-spy/">New York</a>, to the shoot-down of a Maylasian jet from <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29109398">Russian equipment</a>, to their mistreatment of homosexuals, to their brutal crackdown in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Nemtsov">political dissidents</a>, this has gone on long enough.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your patience, attention, and sacrifice in this coming conflict. May God bless America.</p>

<p>In your opinion when did Bush become aware of the conspiracy? If you watch the video of him reading the book during the attacks, I saw serious doubt and questioning in his eyes.</p>

<p>I think he figured it out around 1/14/2002.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My original comment was meant to be satirical. I&#39;m not sure that Bush knows the full extent of the plan even to this day. I think he had to have been aware that <em>something</em> was being planned, but I don&#39;t think he was actually directly involved in any way. This ensures that if something were to go wrong he can claim plausible deniability. I think Bush&#39;s role in the play was to simply be his bumbling idiot self, and do what he was told afterwards. When I watch the video of him being told about the attacks, I don&#39;t see the face of someone who just pulled off a diabolical plot. I think he looks terrified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russians have spy satellites just like the US. Imagery of a drone could be on their images or anything else which contradicts the narrative. Time line, placement of air crafts, etc,etc. There is an economic warfare going on, the West is actively trying to destabilize Russia. What would destabilize the West? Proof that 9/11 was a hit or not how they want you to think it was. You don&#39;t have to fight an enemy if the enemy is fighting itself. All this talks of blackmail is checkers, Putin is a very smart man and plays chess. You want to destroy the enemy? Have them fight amongst themselves. Why do you think Israel wants the ME in conflict? Because if they are fighting amongst each other, than you are out of the lime light. Divide and conquer. Read Sun Tzu&#39;s &quot;the art of war&quot;. They don&#39;t need a war with the US to dismantle it. A civil war here will dismantle itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the office of the President of the United States</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With Russia&#39;s recent cyber attack against our major financial institutions, including the theft if untold sums of money,  and the power vested in my through the War Powers Act, I hereby declare a state of Financial Emergency.</p>

<p>Through it&#39;s callous and deceitful tactics, the Russian Federation and agents associated with it have been implicated in liquidating assets in a variety of small, community banks, which has shown to create a run on all banks.</p>

<p>As of this moment, all financial institutions will be closed for an extended holiday. The Federal Reserve is working closely with the Department of the Treasury to formulate a relief package, but it will take time.</p>

<p>As a stopgap - some depositors funds will be initially used to soften this blow to our economy, and all of our own manufacturing and service  industries to proceed with minimal disruption.</p>

<p>I have met with both the Joint Chiefs and Congressional leadership this evening, and we agree that aggressive action is necessary to curb the Russian Federation&#39;s thirst for territory and hunger for power and resources. As evidence of the last few years, we have seen the Russian Federation&#39;s actions the former Soviet republics of Chechnya, where the Boston Bombers were trained, to Georgia, and most recently culminating with the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. This is just not a taste of things to come, but a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>Congress is busy working through the night to draft an Authorization for the Use of Military Force, which will include provisions for the immediate withdrawal of support for all Russian-owned and Russian-based corporations and persons connected to the Internet and other global communication services. The Pacific Fleet has been mobilized, and Japan, Australia, and South Korea stand firm with us in that particular part of the world.</p>

<p>UN Ambassador Power is working with the general Assembly to craft legislation condemning and imposing harsher sanctions against the Federation, and NATO troops are on the move to Kiev to reinforce the loyalist forces to fight Russian backed separatists with the rigor and fierceness associated with American military might.</p>

<p>Only a strategic pull out of <em>all forces</em> in Crimea, the DHK, LHK, and Donbass will be seen as a move to de-escalate the situation. For too long, the actions of Mr. Putin&#39;s regime have gone unchallenged. From Russian spies being arrested in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/27/us/new-york-alleged-russian-spy/">New York</a>, to the shoot-down of a Maylasian jet from <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29109398">Russian equipment</a>, to their mistreatment of homosexuals, to their brutal crackdown in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Nemtsov">political dissidents</a>, this has gone on long enough.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your patience, attention, and sacrifice in this coming conflict. May God bless America.</p>

<p>TL;DR - I made this up, but if it sounds believable to you - you either hang out here far too much or far too little.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey ask the ghost mafia for help in answering this one..</p>

<p>In your opinion when did Bush become aware of the conspiracy? If you watch the video of him reading the book during the attacks, I saw serious doubt and questioning in his eyes.</p>

<p>I think he figured it out around 1/14/2002.</p>
