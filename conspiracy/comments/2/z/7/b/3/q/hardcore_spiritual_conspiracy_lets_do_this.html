        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Be happy. Just for a moment. It&#39;s a nice feeling. Can you keep it up? What if you could? How much better would your life be, if just for a moment? But you know so much now... or you think you do... or at least you have a better idea than that fool next to you. Granted, they&#39;re perfectly content with whatever hole they&#39;ve dug for themselves, so who are you to poop in it? So forget them. You might wake them up but you probably won&#39;t. You&#39;ll probably get ridiculed for even bringing up the ideas and topics you actually want to talk about. I mean... why does anyone actually care about whatever celebrity is in the news right now? But none of them are important. You are. And you&#39;re who I want to talk to about you.</p>

<p>Are you happy? When&#39;s the last time you thought about the future with any kind of real hope? Not some perverse idealized hope, an actual hope that could seriously be tangible one day. Been a while, no? Well... what if that&#39;s the goal? Give you so much info, whether it&#39;s real or not doesn&#39;t matter, that you take yourself out of the equation? Make you feel powerless, hopeless, depressed... because... why put forth the effort? I mean, if there is a local &quot;do something about it&quot; group that could shield itself from infiltration and let you onboard you&#39;d be all about it but you obviously don&#39;t know those people. So let&#39;s forget about them to. No superheroes. But you. What if you were positive? Not a fake it til you make it. Actually positive. </p>

<p>I mean, you don&#39;t need to get all pseudo-science meta-quantum with everything, unless you do, I&#39;m not knocking it, but you do need to be happy. Have you ever noticed how things tend to go just so much more smoothly when you&#39;re spirits are up? What if that&#39;s all we need to really do? For that to work we&#39;d have to actually be beings of vibration if not &quot;god&quot; exploring itself. No deific entity would want for itself to suffer like this. But it had a bad thought that turned into a bad trip. As such beings we&#39;d be responsible for shaping the existence of the almighty and ourselves.</p>

<p>I mean... no matter how much all of this sucks, we&#39;re going to be fine. The worst they can do is keep you alive. What would you like to live for? Happiness? Or knowing so much about so much evil that it sucks you in?</p>

<p>Do both. Keep your head out of the sand, your eyes open, and your attention all around you. But smile while you do it. There&#39;s more to this than the powers that be will let you in on, and there has got to be more to existence than they could ever possibly have control over. </p>

<p>Think about it. And smile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some (many) on this planet, this life is actually not about being happy.  It’s not about that.  It’s about <em>learning</em>, it’s about <em>development</em>, and often, learning and growing is not always synonymous with “being happy&quot; per se.</p>

<p>It’s sort of like getting in shape.  It’s often excruciatingly difficult to get in good shape.  It takes a lot of hard work - a lot of blood, sweat, and tears.  However, through the blood, the sweat, the tears, and the hard, hard work, you <em>improve</em> - you get better.  Conversely, there might be someone who’s always “happy”, but since they have no interested in being anything <em>but</em> “happy”, they don’t do anything that involves difficulty or struggle, effectively doing away with a huge portion of things that, on <em>this</em> planet anyway and in <em>this</em> age - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">Kali Yuga</a> - one tends to <em>have</em> to go through great difficulty and struggle if one wants to improve and get better, etc.  That person will not only tend to not develop all that much, but they will likely ultimately end up causing themselves much greater harm and be very <em>not</em> happy because they will, in their &quot;happiness&quot;, be unwilling to have difficulty, unwilling to do things they don&#39;t like and deal with the frustration and sadness that comes with that...and they will forgo doing a lot of things that are perhaps actually <em>better</em> for them in the long run.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, therefore, life on this planet might not necessarily be about being “happy”.  It might be about being happy about as much as school is about being happy:  i.e. not very much at all.  School isn’t about being happy.  School is about <em>learning</em>.  School is about figuring out how to read, write, do math, etc, etc.  Many absolutely despise school.  Most people are definitely <em>not</em> happy while they’re in school.  Most would rather be doing a lot of other things…things that make them “happy”.  However, it’s generally not a bad idea to go through with school nonetheless.</p>

<p>Same with life.  Life on this planet is a school - a very, very difficult school.  We are here to <em>learn</em>…learn hard, hard lessons.  This often involves pretty much <em>no</em> amount of fun or happiness for many of us.</p>

<p>However, those who meet the difficulties and the vicissitudes and what are often the very <em>un</em>happy experiences of life on this planet will grow and develop into better beings.</p>

<p>So, though I respect the points you’ve made, and though I absolutely do not think that we should purposely make an effort to be <em>unhappy</em>, I’m not sure that one should necessarily strive too much to simply be “happy”.</p>

<p>I feel strongly that what we should strive to do in this life and on this planet is simply learn as much as we can and grow as much as possible.  Often time that may indeed involve happiness here and there - and this is good.  However, I personally feel the aim and goal in life should be the arriving at and acquisition of <em>wisdom</em> more than happiness.</p>

<p>With wisdom <em>comes</em> happiness.  I wouldn’t say that happiness in itself necessarily leads to wisdom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, whatever your definition of happiness is, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m happier the more I struggle and fail/succeed. Wasn&#39;t talking about getting things and avoiding being uncomfortable or anything like that, specifically. I love to learn and really don&#39;t understand why people stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not being argumentative or contrarian, but if what you&#39;re really talking about in all of this is, as you said here, a manner in which you &quot;struggle and fail/succeed&quot;, then that, technically, isn&#39;t so much about &quot;happiness&quot; per se as much as it is simply learning and developing and living life on this planet, etc.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s working and struggling through life with its failures and successes and learning as much from that as possible that you&#39;re really meaning (and not just striving to &quot;be happy!&quot;), then I would pretty singularly agree with that, sir.</p>

<p>Yes.  Strive to move forward and learn and develop regardless of the failures/successes in life.</p>

<p>Justify?  There is no “justifying” going on.  It is simply an objective assessment and analysis of what is going on.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And you don’t actually stop and think to realize that PRISON IS ITSELF A SCHOOL?  You don’t stop and think to realize that being in a place of suffering is itself something which presents a GREAT lesson that needs to be learned from, dealt with, and developed through?</p>

<p>That would seem correct.</p>

<p>Don’t know what “tbe” means (is this some <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=floyd+mayweather,+tbe&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=1ZAHVa_UMMn1oASwwYGQCA&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1446&amp;amp;bih=743">Floyd Maywether reference</a> the significance to this subject of which I am <em>completely</em> whooshing on?), but transcending “the whole ‘school’ dichotomy” is transcending the prison planet dichotomy as well.</p>

<p>You began your response with a contrarian statement, and then went on to say pretty much <em>exactly the same thing</em> that I myself am saying.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What?  But wait a minute…YOU YOURSELF actually <em>used</em> the “prison planet” analogy.  So now you’re saying you don’t think it’s a prison?  What?</p>

<p>And calling it now a “cycle of hell” as you just mentioned here, it’s EXACTLY THE SAME THING ultimately that I just said above.  Tomayto-Tomahto.  Prison, School, Hell…They are ALL scenarios wherein you find yourself in a place that you <em>don’t</em> want to be in and that you need to develop further through and better yourself in order to <em>get out</em>.  There’s ultimately no really disagreement that even should be attempted here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The insane amounts of suffering that goes on here ( and it reaches everyone on different levels) is simply preposterous</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  100% agreed there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then to have to keep cycling back into this realm infinitely is just another layer of hell itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Definitely.  The “infinitely” part I don’t feel is correct, however.  We don’t cycle back “infinitely”.  We might cycle back for billions of lives until we “figure things out” and move on to the next level of evolutionary development, but even that isn’t “infinite”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it was a school, there would be clear grades, instructors, memories retained from your past lives so you can build on top of what already went down</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, don’t be so darn literal, man.  “School” is about progressing through the solving of situations that cause you to learn.  As such EXISTENCE is a school.</p>

<p>And many people <em>do</em> retain memories of their past lives.  And regardless of the fact that many of us don’t retain specific memories, ALL of us (literally each and every one of us) retain <em>emotional</em> memories of our past life experiences.  Most of us simply aren’t aware that significant portions of our particular personalities - likes and dislikes, etc - come from experiences that we had before in lives past.  This is primarily because the recollection isn’t so much an intellectual one wired in the conscious brain and that the current incarnation recalls as much as it is an emotional feeling that functions and exists at a deeper level of the subconscious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but no, its no like that at all. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it’s <em>exactly</em> like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>enlightenment to break away from all this is an extremely precise razors edge walk, that few will ever pass into.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  Enlightenment is not necessarily specific at all.  It’s very <em>difficult</em> - to be sure - but REAL and ultimate enlightenment involves transcendence - and that transcendence, by its very nature, goes beyond anything and everything…including the “precise razor’s edge” you mention here.  As such, it is no more a “precise razor’s edge” than it is “a universal, ubiquitous, overall understanding and being”.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is indeed true that many will not find that state of being in this life and on this planet.  That, however, is only because we on this planet are children.  The Earth IS a “Prison Planet Hell School” (lol - combing every idea mentioned previously).  The human species is an <em>extremely</em> nascent, very young, very underdeveloped vehicle.  We are in the equivalent of, say, 6th grade junior high school in the galactic/cosmic scheme of things.  We are <em>just</em> beginning to learn greater, more complicated things, but we by <em>no</em> means really have a good understanding of what’s REALLY out there.</p>

<p>There’s a LOT more that exists than the little we’re aware of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;School&quot; is a sham, because once you die, whatever beings, gatekeepers, etc you meet in the after life, will just fuck you over, all over again</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they really wanted to “fuck you over”? trust me, man.  You’d be FUCKED OVER, and there’s really nothing you’d be able to do about it.  As such, even though things are by no means easy on this planet, things could be a LOOOT harder.  School, prison, etc, etc…whatever you want to call it.  It all applies.  And that you want to stick so badly to <em>one</em> categorization only is just an indication of how much more you have to learn.  But okay.  Again, we’re all at different, lower level stages of development here on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Well Mr. No1113, we see here you did alright this round and seemed to have learned plenty at earth school, however, you still need some more classes about love, wisdom, working hard like all the other people do, etc. So this time, we&#39;re sending you to pick up those classes.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay…Yeah?  And?  How does this, somehow, underscore or reiterate your point that “the gatekeepers are only here to fuck you over, all over again”?  What you said here, if nothing else, can be looked upon as being a <em>good</em> thing if it allows the identity in question to develop and grow more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you, believing in the school conceptual illusion, will jump right back into this shit hole, right back where you started from, i.e. school is an illusion trap, to perpetuate your recycling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trust me, man.  The fact that you are as narrow-minded in your responses as you are is a GREAT indication that you are <em>at the very least</em> extremely imbalanced.  The difference between you and I is that you somehow don’t understand how imbalanced you are, and have your mind stuck in a tiny box of perspective.  I’m pretty “meh” about the whole thing, realize that we as a species (myself most definitely included) don’t have “the” perfect idea of what is actually going on, and, as a result, I don’t really care whether you call it a school, a prison, a hell, or a WHATEVER…because it is what it is, and your (our) job while here is to learn and transcend regardless.</p>

<p>Peace,</p>

<p>Assumptions/projections.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very well aware of my own dualities, vices/virtues, personality structures, aware of my own awareness, heart, belly etc, and you don&#39;t know me nor can&#39;t see the context that I may just have been playing devils advocate, the black to your white, the up to your down.....something to keep in mind before assuming.</p>

<p>I know that soon as I take any position, a duality is created, a tiny fragmentation of the whole, and i lose according to zen if any position is held. But, we are just playing, shadow boxing with poetic waxing if you will.</p>

<p>I think we are in agreement in many ways, but there is still loss in translation.I actually remember before I was born and was whole, complete, pure, aware, content......and saw that this experience here is unnecessary, a trap, a drug, a prison tat destroys instead of reforms and if it really was a school, it would be irrelevant as in our pre-existing state, whatever we want to know, learn, access, is available to us instantaneously.</p>

<p>But i digress, and shall return to a transcendence that is always present</p>

<p>That is pretty darn disingenuous, actually.  If you WERE playing “devil’s advocate”, then you should have SAID IT and let it be known.  Instead, you did no such thing and just went off on whatever you were saying as if it WAS indeed what you yourself in fact felt/feel.  What this tells me is that either you are only saying “I was only playing devil’s advocate” to try to save face and not admit and own up to the fact that you WERE in fact saying some pretty limited things, or you <em>are</em>, in fact, very limited in your knowledge and understanding because you apparently don’t know enough to actually LET IT BE KNOWN that you are only playing devil’s advocate if that is/was in fact what you were doing.</p>

<p>In either case, you show that, as I said from the beginning, you have <em>significant</em> failings and limitations - as we all do.  The difference between you and I is that it seems <em>very</em> apparent that you work hard at trying to seem like you know more than you actually do, and end up trying to hide when you get shown to be not very right about something.  Me, however? I will tend to readily concede in a heart beat if you show that you have a point…but only if you actually <em>do</em> have one (which you generally haven’t to the extent that you seem to think that you do).</p>

<p>Something to keep in mind before assuming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we are just playing, shadow boxing with poetic waxing if you will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly.  In a certain sense, this is all definitely all for naught.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think we are in agreement in many ways</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but there is still loss in translation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  I have read no further in your response than this statement here, and I will say at this point that - regardless of whether or not you say anything that seems or even <em>is</em> “catty” or unnecessary or just plain wrong or antagonistic, I shall not retaliate in kind (or will at least try hard not to), for I feel we <em>are</em> saying similar enough things, and I wish not to have this dialogue devolve any further.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I actually remember before I was born and was whole, complete, pure, aware, content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frickin’ <em>awesome</em>.  I would really like to hear a LOT about that.  Please do tell.  I think that is absolutely, utterly fascinating if you do indeed remember, and very rare, of course, as not too many other people have any direct, conscious recollection before their current incarnation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and saw that this experience here is unnecessary, a trap, a drug, a prison tat destroys instead of reforms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well…you’re here though aren’t you?  So that means at the very least that either A) you’re wrong and manifesting on this plane <em>isn’t</em> “unnecessary” or B) it <em>is</em> “unnecessary”, but your soul decided to send you down here anyway - in which case you really have to wonder why that is.  In other words, the fact that YOU ARE HERE begs the question, for if an incarnation is, in fact, unnecessary, then it shouldn’t, in fact, occur.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if it really was a school, it would be irrelevant as in our pre-existing state, whatever we want to know, learn, access, is available to us instantaneously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps in the <em>preexisting</em> state this might be the case.  However, in <em>this</em> limited, physical, third dimensional state that the soul manifested in today, there is a <em>serious</em> paucity of self realization.  As such, part of the process of true transcendence may be to arrive at self realization not only in the spiritual realm where the soul is already MUCH closer to it and already more realized, but in the physical realm as well; the realm where self realization does not come immediately or naturally; the realm where it seems there has to be great amounts of strife, struggle, and work before any level of real self realization really takes place.</p>

<p>Perhaps the soul manifests on this plane because the greater levels of wisdom and understanding that one accrues while in the physical vehicle actually helps <em>the soul itself</em> reach even greater levels of true Self realization still and closer union with The All.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But i digress, and shall return to a transcendence that is always present</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we all will.</p>

<p>Indeed we are already there.  We just have to arrive at this realization.  <em>Much</em> easier said than done, of course, but I’m not certain that this is not part of the point of manifestation in the physical plane in the first place (whether it be on this planet or any other one).</p>

<p>And what have you seen now that you have done this “bee hive poking”?</p>

<p>From the thread that you linked:</p>

<p>If this is true, then your coming here was <em>absolutely</em> not “unnecessary” as you’ve mentioned already.</p>

<p>I was in a group of other consciousness units and they were sort of debriefing me on being born, because I had zero context on what being born on earth means.</p>

<p>And that you keep thinking that this was ever any type of dialogue to “win” in the first place just keeps showing me over, and <em>over</em> again that you’re actually nowhere near as evolved as you keep letting on and thinking you are.</p>

You can&#39;t build up expectation like that and then leave people hanging there without some sort of cleansing, cathartic <em>conclusio</em>, like handing out a tool to undo the damage or showing ways to evade/counteract the onslaught. You totally should have offered a bible study :-p</p>

<p>Jokes aside. Your theory has solid ground to stand on; one could even find a little hope in the amount of energy required to keep us disconnected from each other, nature, reality itself even - it shows that it is human nature to connect, something that automatically will happen once the divisive forces disappear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re grasping at the wrong straw here. When you start using quantum theory to bridge the gap between science and &quot;god&quot; you&#39;ve gone into an endeavor not completely categorized by religion or science. It&#39;s a more results based philosophy, it&#39;s pseudo-science. I say that because you&#39;re looking for the living, not analyzing the dead. Etc etc etc. You might say that the godhead resides in the 10th dimension and creates realities by collapsing wave functions down through the lower dimensions, creating entire universes and histories just to create a specific moment. Sounds like science, sounds like religion... it&#39;s a version of quantum theory. </p>

<p>Well, you don&#39;t have to run that deep or that far with everything. Some rabbit holes aren&#39;t necessary to go down (do you really need to know how to make an MK Ultra style total mind control slave?), or at least don&#39;t go down all of them all the way. It&#39;s dark down there and you might get lost. I&#39;m not saying be afraid to venture, just be aware of your surroundings and make sure you always have an exit strategy.</p>

<p>So whatever you&#39;re talking about... yeah, I totally agree. there&#39;s that nassim haramein guy too who&#39;s pretty interesting. Dutch guy (or whatever, it&#39;s not vital) who thinks torsions are key to a lot things. Space isn&#39;t filled with shaped and lines, it&#39;s all dots all the way up and down.

<p>I&#39;m not talking about uncredentialed bloggers, astrologers, or people whose primary job is to give talks to the lay public. I&#39;m talking about published, Nobel prize winning physicists who are very careful about how they word their conclusions, and generally do not seek publicity beyond their academic roles. It just so happens that their work has forced them, like it or not, into conclusions which basically say something like:</p>

<p>&quot;The Newtonian Model of the universe being made of little billiard balls bouncing off of each other is false. Here are 12,000 experiments proving it, and here&#39;s the mathematics explaining it.&quot;</p>
