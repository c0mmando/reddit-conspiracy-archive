        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In my opinion, when you&#39;re happy, you&#39;re not thinking about the world. You&#39;re not thinking about what is really going on right now, the Ukrainian coup, where soldiers are forced to fight FOR the people who pulled off the coup or are murdered. Forced to watch Palestinians be not only oppressed, murdered in cold blood, etc... But also demonized through propaganda. Seeing how every war since Napoleon has been orchestrated by the mega rich. The worst part of it all, seeing people look at soldiers like heroes, and look at countries like Iraq/Iran/Palestine/Afghanistan as evil, when it is the exact opposite. </p>

<p>Obviously there are A LOT more world events like this, the Egyptian coup, the Syrian coup, the soon-to-be Venezuelan coup. I can go on and on and on.</p>

<p>We realized that school is indoctrination and what is taught within is very limited in use aside from teaching us to obey authority. We realized that work is generally helping one of the big mega corporations gain even more of a foothold on controlling our day to day lives. Very few occupations are actually good. </p>

<p>We realized that there is flouride in our water, our food is poisoned and stripped of its nutrients, our air is sprayed with chemicals.</p>

<p>We realized that our entertainment is controlled. We realized that our media is controlled.</p>

<p>Yet, we should be happy. </p>

<p>Happiness is complacency, it&#39;s allowing yourself to be controlled. Do we feel better when we&#39;re happy? Of course, that&#39;s natural, but they want us to stay happy while they chip away at us in every single area of our life so we don&#39;t fight back.</p>

<p>A lot of new age stuff speaks about being pure love, having no hate or anger, yet, that mindset has kept us enslaved, and the enslavement is accelerating. Are we going to love the puppetmasters of this world to death? If we love enough, will aliens come down and rid the world of them for us? If we love enough will <em>Insert Jesus/Allah/God of choice here</em> come and save us?</p>

<p>Or will getting angry and taking back the world save us? </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been told time and time again something was coming to save us, all throughout history, in fact. Just recently it has been aliens, Pleidians, Sirians, etc... They were supposed to come in 2012. Then 2013. Now I&#39;m pretty sure the people spreading that around gave up and are now saying 2020? Anyway, you get my point. </p>

<p>Happiness, contentment, love, prosperity, we all want it, but maybe we have to act in order to get it. Why is all anger bad? Anger is natural, do you not feel anger any time you feel wronged? What if we never got angry? How would you know when you&#39;ve been wronged?</p>

<p>Anyway, just a little rant, looking for some insights for those of you guys that are deep into the rabbit hole, I know this subreddit has varying degrees of knowledge.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so deep in the rabbit hole that I rarely even think about let alone visit the surface much anymore.</p>

<p>I just posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2z7b3q/hardcore_spiritual_conspiracy_lets_do_this/cpgew05?context=3">this</a> not too long ago.  I think it&#39;s an appropriate response to the above question of yours I quoted here.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t strive for happiness.</p>

<p>Strive for <em>wisdom</em>.  Happiness will come from it, but not always the other way around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just thinking about this last night.</p>

<p>I have to come to realize that there are only 3 important things to me:</p>

<p>1) Knowledge</p>

<p>2) Honesty</p>

<p>3) Love</p>

<p>Love can be interpretted in many different ways, ie: loving yourself, finding a partner who &quot;gets&quot; you, or finding the love in your heart to forgive those close to you.</p>

<p>Honesty is about being an honest person despite the fact that world is run by liars and criminals who will lie every minute of their life, to themselves and others, in order to make gains and profit. </p>

<p>Knowledge, you hit on that perfectly in your post.</p>

<p>&quot;Happiness&quot; is an illusion and a loaded buzzword invented by humans. I understand that this can also be said about &quot;love&quot; and that is why I mentioned the different interpretations earlier. At the end of the day, it is important to separate whats real from whats human made.</p>

<p>Because human&#39;s didn&#39;t invent everything, there are natural laws that existed way before humans.</p>

<p>Anyways... /rant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES to your three things.  They&#39;re really interconnected concepts.  Seeking wisdom/knowledge for true understanding of true love (for one&#39;s self, others, and everything in existence) by being truly honest; not just being truthful or undeceitful but being real, seeing things purely without connotation/attachment, being true to yourself by not pushing or weighing down, being honest with what is right now, understanding the impermanence of behaviors/situations/beings/everything except the truth which will always remain the truth.  Strive to attain higher and higher wisdom to understand and live the truth and increasing love will come along in the journey and thus purity/happiness/that thing we all are trying to figure out how to achieve.</p>

<p>Correct.  It&#39;s made all the more difficult when the forgers of this civilization put so much undue stress on &quot;being <em>happy!</em>&quot; and confuse most here into thinking that that IS indeed the point of life.  It consciously and subconsciously pushes and pressures many of the humans living on this planet to unduly strive to &quot;at all costs, be <em>happy!&quot;</em> - a thing which causes many to ignore and not <em>really</em> dig in and investigate all the many things about living here that are very, very difficult and that NEED assessment and investigation <em>before</em> any real and true happiness can be achieved.  This lack of true investigation ends up making people even WORSE off than they ever would have been otherwise because they end up ignoring all the baggage they need to address in their hearts and minds before they have any hopes of actually really being truly happy.</p>

<p>Being happy is like getting in shape.  It doesn&#39;t just &quot;happen&quot; magically.  You don&#39;t tend to just &quot;get&quot; in great shape by just <em>wanting REALLY, REALLY badly</em> to be in shape.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>You have to <em>work</em> for it.  Same with being happy:  You have to make sure that you do the work to stabilize your mind and the things in and around your life to justifiably <em>bring about</em> happiness; get rid of the negative people and energy and/OR stabilize your HEART and yourself <em>inside</em> (i.e. mentally and emotionally speaking, etc) so that you don&#39;t get taken off track or are unnecessarily imbalanced.  This takes great, great patience, skill, and a <em>lot</em> of courage, strength, and fortitude because there are often a LOOOOT of things on this planet that get in the way of achieving the state of balance necessary to achieve true happiness.  If one does the work and faces all this darkness and these demons, then one can possibly have real and <em>true</em> reason to be happy and not just be a living in horrible, dark denial to all the real obstacles and challenges around.</p>

<p>Anyway...&quot;rant&quot; over...</p>

<p>Depending on what the hobby is, I wouldn’t necessarily disagree with this.</p>

<p>Those don’t sound like “hobbies”, sir.  Those sounds like things you’re working on to get yourself better, improve, and grow.  No disrespect to hobbies, but I think these things are a lot more and better than just “hobbies”.</p>

<p>Correct.  Very much so.</p>

<p>The world has <em>already</em> gone to shit, my brother.  It seems there’s so much that goes on in this planet that we have very little if any control whatsoever over.  I would say don’t strive to get the upper hand over anything but your own inner self and how you react to and think about the things around you.  It seems we can’t really change the things around and outside of us too much if at all, so strive to make sure that your <em>insides</em> are as right as can be.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like you’ve been well on your way though…so carry on.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happiness comes from within and it takes working on myself to find a sense of it. The first step was turning off the television. Second was getting in shape and eating healthy. Third was taking a hard look at my life and assessing my belief systems. </p>

<p>The second stage is ongoing. Feeling healthy makes everything seem a bit easier to tackle. It&#39;s a work in progress. </p>

<p>The third stage is a big one. Its the meat of the subject because it literally makes us who we are. Trying to figure this out can be daunting. It helps to have humility. For me its another work in progress. The more I work at it the better I feel about myself. Keep in mind this section will open up the deepest wounds we carry. Life can become an emotional rolller-coaster but it&#39;s crucially important to let go of that baggage. And we all have it. Our ego&#39;s might disagree but fuck the ego. If it&#39;s holding you back then it needs to get checked as well.</p>

<p>So working through these issues have given me a sense of happiness. Little glimpses of whats in store if I keep moving forward. Its helped me realize my dreams and brought out the creative side in me. Creating (even if its crappy) helps bring back that spark of excitement and adventure I had when I was a kid.</p>

<p>This is my formula. It seems to be working. Even if I get depressed by whats happening in the world I can bounce back by seeing the good within the bad. I try my best to stay neutral. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you dig deep enough the rabbit hole, you (I) realise that everything is a manifestation of the cosmic battle between good/love/light and bad/separation/ego/dark.</p>

<p>all the wars, all the control systems, all the nonsense that happens can only happen because of human fear, unhappiness, distress. if humanity was truly happy and at peace, who would want to go to war? </p>

<p>if you are happy/at peace, you uplift the people around you and everyone you come in contact with. you &#39;disable&#39; the fear memes/viruses/narratives that ThePowersThatBe desperately try to pump out. being angry when things are fucked up is natural, but being angry and fearful all the time makes things worse. </p>

<p>the happiness/peace that I speak of is not one that is achieved by being ignorant. yes, the &#39;sheeple&#39; are not scared/angry that their government is deeply corrupt or that their media is controlled. but they are not &#39;happy&#39; in any sense. they are scared of &#39;global warming&#39;, &#39;terrorism&#39;, my wife cheated on me, I need to get a good job, etc.</p>

<p>true happiness/peace is achieved when you detach yourself from this human drama. go out in nature. the cat and the tree is not worried about global warming or the police state. bad things exist, but you don&#39;t have to allow them to keep bubbling in your attention 24/7. thinking/complaining about how bad things are doesn&#39;t help things. if you feel compelled to act, to do something to say something, by all means do it, but don&#39;t do it from a place of fear/anger (because people take you less seriously when you do so).</p>

<p>tldr; bad things happen but you don&#39;t have to feel bad about them.</p>

<p>To think that one person can&#39;t make a difference hurts, but to see so many people with the same ideology of myself, why can&#39;t we make a difference. Some day, I&#39;ll put my hand up and take one for the team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A young man is walking along the ocean and sees a beach on which thousands and thousands of starfish have washed ashore. Further along he sees an old man, walking slowly and stooping often, picking up one starfish after another and tossing each one gently into the ocean.</p>

<p>“Why are you throwing starfish into the
ocean?,” he asks.</p>

<p>“Because the sun is up and the tide is going out
and if I don’t throw them further in they will
die.”</p>

<p>“But, old man, don’t you realize there are miles
and miles of beach and starfish all along it!
You can’t possibly save them all, you can’t even
save one-tenth of them. In fact, even if you
work all day, your efforts won’t make any
difference at all.”</p>

<p>The old man listened calmly and then bent
down to pick up another starfish and threw it
into the sea. “It made a difference to that one.”</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard sometimes... but even something as small as a smile can make a big difference to a stranger, if you can muster one. Cheers (:</p>

There is all kinds of satanic/esoteric imagery in movies and media, but the people involved still claim there is no God, and we should all know that! My belief in Christ and his teachings is my only calm in the storm. He warned us this time would come, and gave us great advice! This world will end, and those who have done evil for personal gain WILL be judged and punished accordingly. All we can do is try to be the best influence, person, friend, we can be...

<p>if you think big thoughts you have four choices.</p>

<p>(1)  knowingly work for It.  despite all those who have sold their souls saying it was not worth it, apparently it&#39;ll be different for you and not at all deadening.  your waking life won&#39;t become a living hell, would They lie to you?</p>

<p>(2) try to &quot;fight&quot; it with activism and such and single yourself out for one of the Lists.  you might end up working for them if you start here.</p>

<p>(3) succumb to the skulls and the crossbones and the &quot;Dance While Burning&quot; meme.  live and die as a consumer.  are you a conspiracy theory <em>consumer</em>?</p>

<p>(4) the hard one.  live a real life.  stop being a dickhead and be nice to people around you.  realize sheep are sheep and will always be whether they wake up or not. get married.  return to traditional human ways of happiness.  raise children with your spouse.  </p>

<p>growing up is what they don&#39;t want you to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a chronic neurological disease; I have somehow managed to become fairly successful in spite of it, but if I lose sleep I become disabled from the stress and it has cost me jobs; I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to keep my job with a baby in the house.</p>

<p>However, my property is split into rental units; I live in one and rent out the others. As I get older if I&#39;m successful enough to afford it, I&#39;ve considered freeing up one of the units for troubled teens. So, I would find a kid who is struggling due to disability and maybe had some brushes with the law; not one who is completely lost, but one who still has some good left in him; and offer him a &quot;last chance&quot;. You can stay here for free for one or two years; no drugs, no guests, no criminal activity. You have x days to get a job, or go back to school, you can&#39;t just sit around. Take this chance to get on your feet; if you&#39;re not going to make use of it, get out so that someone else can.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also volunteered a little bit of my time to community service, specifically food security: helping to set up aquaponics greenhouses. From time to time, I take  random streetperson to a restaurant for a good meal. As I get older, I will probably spend more of my time doing things like this; if I did have a child, I might not have the time.</p>

<p>I believe that it takes all kinds to make the world go around; not having a child is not in and of itself an evil. Be careful of judging others lest you be judged; judge me not.</p>

The reality is that the symptoms of migraine are exactly identical to the symptoms of stroke, only temporary. many women who get migraines say that the pain is worth than childbirth; most people simply have no comprehension or understanding; it&#39;s impossible to understand unless you&#39;ve experienced it for yourself. I have experienced this pain literally many hundreds of times, possibly thousands of times in my life. Without medication I get migraines 3 or 4 days a week. Many people take their own lives in despair. I think the only reason I&#39;ve survived this long is because I&#39;ve had migraines since I was a child; it&#39;s all I know. I went over my handlebars on my bike once; busted both wrists, my elbow, a finger, herniated a disk and possibly compressed some vertebrae. In the emergency room, I was laughing and flirting with my wife; the nurses couldn&#39;t understand it. Part of it was shock, but part of it was that the pain simply didn&#39;t register on my pain scale; broken bones are nothing compared to a migraine, although I admit that the constant unrelenting pain got to me after a few days.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never had a migraine, it makes me wonder how long you would make it if you were suddenly put in my shoes: how long exactly could you take the pain before you simply found a bridge and jumped? A month? A few months? A year, maybe?</p>

<p>It felt so good to be judged the first time: judge me again. Tell me I&#39;m irresponsible for not having children. Tell me to adopt a child. Tell me, how I am a perpetual boy for wanting some pleasure in my life.</p>

<p>The thing is: time is on my side. With the passage of time, all people suffer. Some people find that the more they suffer, the more understanding and less judgemental they become. Others learn nothing.  you don&#39;t know anything about me. I hope, for your sake, you never get as exquisitely familiar with pain as I am. May you never learn what I have. Keep on judging, judge.</p>

<p>I dont care if youre impotent or both legs broken or whatever.  okay so you try to do good even tho adoption is too hard for you.  neato.  raising children is more influential than serving teenagers meals.  sorry you don&#39;t have the option available, not my fuckin problem though and it changes nothing about what I said. </p>

<p>actually it just shows your &quot;don&#39;t have kids!!&quot; argument comes from a place of personal and private pain for you, and isn&#39;t a rational issue as a result.  </p>

<p>still judging you, duh, just like youre judging me.  </p>

Humans haven&#39;t even increased the percentile of CO2 in the atmosphere by 0.1 percent, and the temperature is right where it should be, they don&#39;t even call it global warming anymore, cause it ain&#39;t getting warmer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The atmosphere hasnt heated up that much yet because the ocean acts as a thermal mass, storing heat. As it warms up it becomes less able to store heat; then the atmosphere will heat up very suddenly.</p>

<p>The ocean is dying. </p>

<p>I was about to start trying to explain the problems to you, but there&#39;s really no point: you won&#39;t change your opinions anyway. I agree that part of the problem with food is politics and distribution. </p>

<p>I think maybe I&#39;ll just stick with a simple analogy: a global warming denier told me that people were tiny compared to the planet; he said, when I&#39;m driving along and a fly comes in the window and lands on my, I brush it off and continue driving. We are that fly.</p>

<p>My response to him: I live in Canada. We have moose, they&#39;re big animals. Really, really big. We also have mosquitoes. They&#39;re very tiny. The mosquitoes can kill the moose; not by sucking their blood, but because they swarm so densely that the moose can&#39;t breathe, and it suffocates to death.</p>

<p>Moving everyone to Texas would burn an awful lot of oil; I suppose that&#39;s where people in California might end up now that there is no more water. The climate change will cause us to burn more energy moving around from place to place; we will be forced to accelerate our energy use at a time when we need to reduce it. </p>

<p>You believe what ever you want; I have come to accept that this is the beginning of the end of humanity. I&#39;m ok with it</p>

<p>Only you as an individual are responsible for the happiness you feel. The best way to be happy is to live an enriched life. The greatest wealth comes from having friends and family that care about you, and surrounding yourself with their company. </p>

<p>From doomsday predictions like 2012 / impending martial law (since 1992) and alien saviors. It&#39;s all a bunch of bullshit, mental chains people put on by not being able to see the crap lies for what they are. </p>

<p>For every banker and king willing to exploit you for money and greed. </p>

<p>There is a blogger, talk show host, and website willing to exploit your fears and gullible intentions for the sake of money and greed. </p>

<p>Alex Jones, David Icke, History Channel, Jesse Ventura, etc. </p>

<p>These people make money off of your fears, they have a vested interest in promulgating it further to the point of insanity. To keep their followers irrationally paranoid to the point of depression and borderline insanity. </p>

<p>Just remember 90% of the predictions, rants, conspiracies that are out there are BS and learning to differentiate from what is real and what isn&#39;t is the only medicine that works. </p>

He said, &quot;stay in your 3 foot world. If you cant affect it, dont worry about it.&quot; It struck me as propaganda and a form of conditioning but lately its made me wonder, is it better to do as he said? </p>

<p>My life has changed recently; new job, seeing my kid more, nearly at my fitness goals, making more money. I really dont have much to complain or be unhappy about. Keeping myself aware but out of the loop enough to not be interested in the petty news thats fed to you on facebook, twitter or instagram or whatever and not watching tv has made a tremendous difference in my life. More you start to worry about yourself and those in your immediate circle, the happier youll be. I will say this though, their will come a time where i will have to fight or protest or riot, and im ready for that day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thing is to never be afraid or feel helpless. Happiness is a fleeting moment, like eating your favorite candy bar, its good till the last bite then its over. As fucked up as the world is you can never let it take your smile. I&#39;ve been in the Rabbit Hole since 9/11 maybe a bit before that. I&#39;m 34 now and in stead of being angry at how fucked the world is and instead of trying to change my friends I accept them as they are and change myself. I&#39;m a way happier then when i was in my early 20&#39;s. I don&#39;t chase after status or materials, I&#39;m open to the world. I don&#39;t know whats going to happen so i stop trying to control it. I say if your passionate about helping the world then be a better person. Do things to make it a better place. I achieved this by becoming an artist having a voice, and not being afraid of machines or our fake government. Money isn&#39;t real either just another tool we use, so i use it for things that will make my life better. For example I&#39;m starting my own company I&#39;ve printed stickers buttons and t-shirts and my company has a message, yes I&#39;ve become a entrepreneur in a completely corrupt society, but I&#39;m doing something about it through my art and my determination, to not just be another person who sits on the couch watching netflix or complaining on reddit. I&#39;m active in my community and i&#39;m doing what makes me happy and that&#39;s be a creator rather then a destroyer. So create something with love and give it to the world and if the world rejects you then know that the world is not worthy of you. Peace  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First one has to know the corruption before you learn the next step and that next step is realizing that everything that is happening today has happened since the dawn of time.  Someone can stay focused on the evil around them until they no longer see the beauty and that obession will color their outlook until they themselves become part of the evils they so desperately fight.</p>

<p>Your cure is to understand that you can not change someone else.  You can only be responsible for your actions.   That means you have to walk your talk.  You will fail many times and if you focus on your failures you can not move forward.  Learn and let others learn.  Make changes within your own life that allows you to become the best you.   Your reactions to your world primarily comes from within you.  If you don&#39;t like the world around you or where its going then you must live a kinder life on your own.  Wrap yourself in the beauty of the world and allow it to give you strength.  Wake up each day believing the world is mostly good and you will be able to see it as such.  Then go out and let that attitude influrence others.</p>

I&#39;m going with the flow until there is an opportunity to change it. It may be in my lifetime, it may not, so I will teach my kids to teach their kids until the time does come. I know some of you may be fighting depression already, but somethings you can&#39;t control. Grow your own food, filter your water, move to somewhere with cleaner air/less responsibilities if these are the things that you can&#39;t live with. Find happiness within yourself. Go travelling, experience new things. Work out, eat the right food. Strengthen your mind and body. I&#39;ve accepted that this is the state of affairs and I&#39;ve accepted that I only have this life to make it count. No point in dwelling in sorrow and not making a difference in somebodies world.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A lot of new age stuff speaks about being pure love, having no hate or anger, yet, that mindset has kept us enslaved, and the enslavement is accelerating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is and it isn&#39;t in my view. They sure as shit are trying to accelerate their control mechanisms, but that&#39;s only because they&#39;re actually losing their ability to control. Sometimes when you get into the states of extreme negativity, it&#39;s hard to see the forest from the trees but there&#39;s a movement building that is going to smash apart the old paradigm and sweep in a wonderful new world.</p>

<p>Honestly, I am the happiest I have ever been. I have an amazing life. I&#39;m surrounded by wonderful people and have an abundance of amazing experiences and new ideas coming to me all the time. I consider it my responsibility to be a positive force in the world, I share my knowledge but I try not to use fear as a mechanism for communicating my ideas. I&#39;ve had enough spiritual experiences that I am not afraid of death and although I find suffering abhorrent, the reality of the situation is actually fucking hilarious when you take a greater perspective. We are infinite beings! The suffering we endure may seem senseless, but when you are infinite, a couple of years of suffering is nothing.</p>

<p>If you consider the universe as a delicate dance between the forces of light and dark, love and fear, order and chaos, this extends through to every product of the universe, including the choices we make in our life. Every thought generated is broadcast into the universe and harmonises with similar vibrations. If we give in to the illusion, that our material form is all that matters, the situation does become quite tragic, but when you know that we are so much more than just flesh and bones, it gives you the capacity to use the power of your mind to transmute the culture of fear we&#39;ve been raised in and instead emit positive vibrations that harmonise and strengthen the higher vibrations and through that, make more attractive/accessible these levels for other people.</p>

<p>2012 wasn&#39;t supposed to be some event where at 11pm that night a bunch of beings came down and swooped us up. It was an inflection point. A time when certain cosmic conditions changed such that the process of rediscovering our true nature becomes increasingly easy. This task isn&#39;t going to be handed to us though. It is us who exist in this density of consciousness and us who must do the work and make the choices ourselves. That&#39;s all it really is. A choice between love or fear. </p>

<p>There will be a critical mass achieved in very short time. Just look at the dialogue of the movements around the world. Disclosure doesn&#39;t just exist as some illuminati faction blessing us with knowledge that&#39;s been suppressed. It also involves cosmic vibrations washing over us, and through those vibrations, raising our consciousness such that our &quot;own&quot; creative ideas are more aligned with source and the discoveries we make about ourselves and the universe occur spontaneously in an increasing fashion. From our vantage point is appears that we are separated and exist within this duality, but when you truly understand how seamless the link is between our higher selves and our conscious selves, and how the thoughts we experience are sent to us from our higher selves, all you have to do is follow your inner light and passion and truly wonderful things start happening. </p>

<p>I know it must be hard for many people who aren&#39;t as fortunate as I am to have access to amazing people, but I can assure you they exist and the number of them who are aware of what&#39;s going on in the world is increasing every second. Go find them and make friends!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things being grim in the grand theme of things is negligible in so far that doesn&#39;t mean they are for you personally or must be so out of necessity. If diving in too far impacts your health or causes anger, it&#39;s best to step back for a while and eventually rejoin the fray when your grief settled down.</p>

<p>Do what good you can within your immediate sphere of influence. Of course, should a war break out we&#39;ll all be negatively affected and we&#39;ll all be further milked by our monetary system regardless - however it is your views and values that inevitably matter - and as a result what your individual contribution to the &#39;whole&#39; is.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve family make sure to pass on your wisdom. Should war occur make sure to not participate. Others will. They will die. They&#39;ll gladly fight. We may even be labelled traitors for not being meatshields. That&#39;s how the world functions. For as long as you know what&#39;s right and truth though, you&#39;re one to find happiness in life and therein within death even. If you die unhappily or with remorse and regret you&#39;ve not used your life time correctly. Be you, love, live life and share - not matter how shitty all else is if you lived up to your values you&#39;ll even forgive your potential murderer and leave this world a peace - a luxury (and a realization) that many make too late if not outright lack it.</p>

<p>Fight the good fight but never step on your enemies&#39; level. knowledge, wisdom and insight is what changes the world and every little input is a little beginning which, possibly even long after our lifetime(s) begins to flourish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a phase you go through, like eye awakening moment at the beginning of understanding. This phase of anger will pass, and you will find things in your own life that has meaning and make you happy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m deep in the rabbit hole, but I feel like I have their basic game figured out. You don&#39;t need to be kept on all the news all day, just take a look every once in awhile. Focus instead on expanding your knowledge (I&#39;ve been studying these secret groups religion of Hermeticism, Alchemy), define what you truly want out of life, and make goals to that end. My goals in life changed a lot when I got out of the rat race. And remember that no matter how many conspiracies you see around you, no 1 group with the same goals control everything. There are lots of parties that struggle for power under the surface. </p>

<p>Lastly, fear and anger is the emotion they want you to feel at all times, because its debilitating, and keeps you from having anything meaningful in your life. Don&#39;t give in to it. Spend much less time reading news and conspiracy stories, and more time reading a good book, or going out in the world to a concert, or comedy club. Anything that gets you out into the social world and reconnect with other people, I know their sheeple, but everyone&#39;s path to enlightenment is different. Focus on peoples strength instead of weaknesses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll notice that many of the comments here are telling you to distract yourself. I think that is a weak answer. If you seek the truth, you must decide WHY you do. Is it to help others and yourself? Is it so you can appear smarter than others? The only real meaning in life is adaptation and survival, and if you can do that with honor and play the game without cheating, then you are succeeding on a higher level. Yes, we were all born into a scam. Tough shit. The question is, will you sedate yourself with distraction? Stand on the shoulders of giants and claim to be one? Or will you struggle and press on so that others will know the truth, if it even exists? The only thing that keeps me going is the idea that maybe the mountains and valleys in life that we struggle to traverse in search of truth may really be the footprints of the gods, and to walk through them with dignity and honor is the best one can do, no matter how impossible it may seem. Do you seek truth for personal gain, or because it will free your brothers and sisters in this world enslaved by madness and fear? The real answer is only as good as what you are fighting for. Remember that EVERYTHING you do is reflected and carries into the world like a wave, and then decide what kind of things you want to fill the world with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WAY, way near the bottom of the hole, there was a light.  And it turned out that the hole was not a hole at all, but a tunnel.  And the light was the other end.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t going to comment, but it keeps itching at me so here it goes.</p>

<p>We are going to win, and the NWO/Illuminati are going to fall.  That&#39;s right, all this bullshit is coming to end, and much sooner than anybody thinks.  And on a scale far grander than thought possible.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m happy.</p>

<p>Although, I think I&#39;m the only one who believes any of it.  And with good reason, because it&#39;s so easy to dismiss.  But if you&#39;re deep enough down the hole, you can see that it all fits together too perfect, and feels too right, for it too be wrong.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve told this story many times before, which is why I didn&#39;t want to say it again.  But you seem like a person who could get something out of at least pondering to possibilities of it being real.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve read this before, my apologies.</p>

<p>Backstory - This is, quite literally, considered the greatest secret of modern history.</p>

<p>World Wars I and II were fake.</p>

<p>Both sides were secretly being run by the same people -- with the same goal.</p>

<p>Over 100 million people died -- for a completely different reason than they thought.</p>

<p>Both sides fighting these wars -- Axis and Allies -- were owned and controlled by the same international bankers.</p>

<p>These world wars were used to plunder central banks and private holdings of their gold -- worldwide -- and turn them over to the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>The official number for all the gold ever dug out of the earth is 166,500 tons. This is a lie. The real amount is:</p>

<p>2,420,937.4 metric tons of gold.</p>

<p>The idea was that in order to stop war, we needed to collect all the gold in one place, and then use it collectively to better humanity. Of course, it was all a ruse.</p>

<p>The bankers who sold this idea to the ancient families and governments of the world gained access to what is now referred to as the Global Collateral Accounts. This is the source and true assets for all of the western central bank printing presses. This is why the IMF, World Bank, etc. are all powerful and can do almost anything they please.</p>

<p>Instead of spreading the wealth throughout the world, the hoarded it for themselves and used it to continue the wars, disease, and poverty.</p>

<p>This secretive group of nasty people are what most people refer to as the Illuminati. Many will argue that it is the Masons, or the Vatican, or the Rothschilds, or the Rockefellers, or the Bushes, or the Queen of England, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>The truth is, It&#39;s parts of all of them. In various levels of involvement and performing certain tasks they all collude together.</p>

<p>The common name now given to this collective is &quot;the Cabal&quot;.</p>

<p>They&#39;re aim is nothing short of complete world domination. The most current plan is to reduce the population of the planet to about 500 million people total. It will then be much easier to control things.</p>

<p>They&#39;re a thousand more details but I&#39;ll cut to the fun part.</p>

<p>Most of you have heard this story in one form or another, but what you have not heard is this:</p>

<p>There is another group, even more secret than the others, and they are about to flip the world over</p>

<p>You see, all along, the ancient secret societies, together with small bands of very well connected people, have been building a plan to stop them.</p>

<p>It is simply called The Plan.</p>

<p>Without revealing any details of the actions about to take place, here ore some of the results you can look forward to in the very near future.</p>

<p>First, get back control of the Global Collateral Accounts and cut off the funding powers of the Cabal.</p>

<p>Round up and arrest ALL the bad guys. The list is literally millions long. You know the FEMA camps they built for us? That&#39;s where they&#39;ll be stuck.</p>

<p>There is literally about 7 semi truck loads of evidence to convict these people. The &quot;good guys&quot; have been collecting it for a LONG time.</p>

<p>The Global Collateral Accounts will then be used to stop hunger and poverty, clean up the environment, provide homes for all, and create jobs for everyone.</p>

<p>At the same time, the hidden technologies will be released and developed. Free energy, replicators (or constructors), and incredible healing techs (think growing back of limbs).</p>

<p>The USA will move away from admiralty law to a system of common law, with much of the world following in our footsteps soon after. It&#39;s simple, no harm to people or property, and treat other like you want them to treat you.</p>

<p>The global financial system will be overhauled to be what is should have been all along. Real and transparent. All things will be based on actual assets. No more gambling with phoney FIAT crap. The good guys have already cut off access to the Accounts, this is the real reason for the global financial crisis.</p>

<p>Wars will no longer be tolerated by anyone, anywhere, for any reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry you got discouraged, but you&#39;re not alone. Like I said, I think I&#39;m the only one still following.  It was hard when it was all talk , but now I see the actions. Let me try and point out a few.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the biggest and most obvious.  The new eastern financial system.  Back when we first learned about the global collateral accounts, it was pointed out that obviously it could never be used within the context of the current, corrupted, and cabal own financial system.  The only way to move it forward is it the east would need to build an entirely new financial system.  This was a bit heartbreaking because it was so daunting, but here we are, the new system has launched.</p>

<p>Then we have this idea of an alliance of almost 200 nations standing up to the Cabal.  This too sounded like a pipe dream, but now we have BRICS, and the un-aligned nations movement.  Just go listen to some of the speeches at the g77 and such and you&#39;ll hear how much anti NWO sentiment is out there.</p>

<p>Then we have Putin and China purging their ranks of the Cabal agents. This should be an obvious reality to everyone by now. </p>

<p>Another recent and startling change might actually be happening currently in the CIA.  First there was the reported lockdown at Langley where it was rumored a purging of the bush / rockefeller faction had taken place.  This seemed pretty far fetched until last week with the announcement of the complete overhaul of the structure of the CIA. Sounds like the good guys in the Pentagon have taken charge there.  That means the guys that wacked JFK and such are no longer operating.</p>

<p>Then we&#39;ve got the Neil Keenan and global collateral account bunkers saga.  There have been updates coming from his team over the years on this whole thing.  But what happened this last Christmas was the closest we&#39;ve ever seen to proof when Mr Keeman became the first Westerner to enter one of the bunkers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.neilkeenan.com/neil-keenan-update-making-history-new-beginnings-2/">http://www.neilkeenan.com/neil-keenan-update-making-history-new-beginnings-2/</a></p>

<p>Just wait until we get the 2 hour video tour footage...</p>

<p>Anyway, there are a humdred other little data points that feed into this, but this is just a sample of some of what&#39;s been happening on inside, at the highest levels of the game.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and did anybody noticed that the British are supporting the new China Bank?  sounds like the Rothschilds are a lot smarter than the bush / Rockefeller clans.  It&#39;s great to actually see the football falling apart and fighting with itself.  Thing is, they&#39;re the worst of any of them, and they won&#39;t be allowed to bring any of their fiat gambling crap to the game anymore.</p>

<p>I&#39;m telling ya, it&#39;s game over or the bad guys. The writing&#39;s all over the wall, you just gotta know how to read it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand and certainly wish for all of what you said to be 100% true, however, I&#39;ve followed many different people that have said they&#39;ve been making huge changes around the world yet 6 months to a year later nothing has changed, including the Donate button on their websites.</p>

<p>I remember being excited about &quot;free energy&quot; - it ended up being a total hoax, the website I was reading at the time had a huge surge of viewership, then 6 months down the line after they said &quot;it&#39;s almost here!&quot; - nothing. One year down the line, absolute silence about free energy. </p>

<p>I remember being excited about ETs landing and helping free humanity, I remember when a major site said &quot;It will happen VERY VERY soon&quot; and &quot;We almost triggered the event early due to the circumstances on the planet&quot;, proving that they were &quot;ready&quot;, 1 year later - absolutely nothing, 2 years later - absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>There have been very...very few people that make money off of their information that I consider to be credible, and even those people I take with a grain of salt, generally the type of people that have really good information but nothing to help us in our situation, then profit off of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it was very disheartening to see all the well intentioned people taken for a ride over the years buy all the fakers and scammers who seized upon the opportunity to make a buck.</p>

<p>Near the beginning it was encouraging to see all these organizations, groups, and peoples popping up with all kinds of cool info.  But as time went on almost all of them turned out to be scams or out right operations by the Cabal themselves to try and get their hands in the accounts.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned for sure through all of this is that there&#39;s only one source of truth when it comes to the global collateral accounts and that is Neil Keenan.  seriously, if it&#39;s about the accounts and it didn&#39;t come from Neil, it&#39;s hogwash.  word on the street is the Pentagon boys won&#39;t make their big moves until Neil has finished his work with the accounts.  It&#39;s crazy to think so much hangs in the balance on one guy. but that&#39;s where we are   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently this is no longer the case, they have been busy cleaning house.  Here&#39;s a comment from Neil&#39;s team a while back, I believe this was a response to a similar question as yours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neil states that what is real is that the East is mostly all cleaned up in relation to banking activity, this includes Hong Kong and the HSBC (Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) – which are now operating proper banking protocols; because the family has ‘mopped the floor with them’. Neil continues that nearly all of Asia have now got their banks working properly and there is no more ‘Fed BS’ occurring. Nevertheless, the West is still attempting to play with us – even though the West are on their last legs and in the final death throes. The Dragon family have made it clear to Neil that when the ‘signings’ do occur, these will be in China not the US</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even beyond all this, what&#39;s real is that the entire world now knows all to well how fraudulent and crooked the current Western financial system is and they no longer want to be a part of it.  The east understand the only way we have a future is if things are run above board and transparent.  That&#39;s what the new system is suppose to be.</p>

<p>The idea behind the takedown of the Cabal is to first knock them out financially, and then sweep up all the criminals. </p>

<p>Anyway, I said to him, &quot;look, you believe all this stuff.  You have kids.  I don&#39;t believe half of what you believe, but I still don&#39;t know what to tell my kids.  I don&#39;t want them to wait as long as I did to start figuring out the real deal in life, but I don&#39;t want to crush their spirits either.&quot;</p>

<p>He says, &quot;No, man, you can&#39;t fuck up your kids like that.  You have to let them in on things at an appropriate age.&quot;</p>

<p>So I said, &quot;so what can you do?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At one time I was completely obsessed with 9/11. It was all I could think about. My mind had latched onto it trying to understand and figure it out and it would not let go. My wife thought I was losing my mind. I almost got fired from work because I sent out a mass Email to over 600 people that thoroughly explained the controlled demolition theory in 2004. Since then the rabbit hole only got deeper because that&#39;s what it does.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned to just not think about it and enjoy life when it&#39;s time to enjoy life. It&#39;s out of our control for the most part. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just weird, watching all the people go about their day...they go through life believing the false narrative and the false reality. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to live like that again...in ignorant bliss. Oh well, we&#39;re fucked and there is no going back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I discovered the truth about our world I felt powerful instead of scared/depressed. I honestly can sense that humanity is waking up and I can sense the horror of those in power through their increasingly more complex attempts to maintain the stability of the system. I&#39;m constantly probing co-workers and friends about their feelings on political issues (while trying not to annoy the shit out of them) and more often than not they are telling me they don&#39;t trust the higher levels of government at all.</p>

<p>I also believe TPTB or whatever you want to call them are actually descendants of the survivors of a great cataclysmic event that almost wiped out humanity 13,000 years ago. I believe these people (or rather their ancestors) started with good intentions but we&#39;re corrupted by their own power. There is a lot of geological and theological evidence (look up Randall Carlson &amp; Graham Hancock) of a literal great flood caused by an asteroid impact in North America about 12,800 years ago. This asteroid instantly vaporised the ice layer that covered the entire top half of North America and the resulting melt waters are the cause of the great flood. At the same time the reduced weight on the earth&#39;s crust gives credence to the idea that Atlantis was a real civilization that may have resided at the point where the Caribbean, African, and Eurasian continental plates met. The borders of the continental plates would act like a fulcrum and as the Caribbean plate rose back up Atlantis would sink into the sea.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually agnostic and always have been, but I do believe theological and religious texts hold immense value in giving us hints about our history. I think humans are a species with Amnesia of our true origins. I believe we were once an extremely advanced civilization that was almost wiped out.</p>

<p>The fallacy here involves the causal relationship of the USA to Islamic impulses and Ukrainian autonomy.</p>

<p>Islam causes the violence against Muslims and nonMuslims alike.  History going back 1400 years makes that clear.  </p>

<p>That the USA ripped the bandage/scab off the wound which is Iraq by toppling the Sunni Minority Junta of Saddam merely served to speed up conflicts that had been locked in place since the Ottoman empire dissolved and before.  Sunni&#39;s did not just start killing Shiites in the 20th century!  Please!</p>

<p>Regarding the Ukraine, do Ukrainians have treaties with Russian and the USA that have been violated ...BY RUSSIA?  YES.  </p>

<p>Do Ukrainians have a right as a free people to create a policy that Russia hates?  YES.</p>

<p>Do Russians have a legal or ethical right to invade Ukrainian sovereign territory and insert &quot;little green men&quot; like the US did in Nicaragua during the Contra period?  NO.  Two wrongs never make a right.  The Ukrainian people have forcefully described their majority opinion in electing the &quot;Chocolate man&quot; and they said that the future must lie with Europe, not (exclusively) Russia.  </p>

<p>That Russia seems to be trying to re-enact the mindset of the Czarist period should be what really gets you upset, not the notion of a free people wishing to pursue a better standard of living by copying the Poles. </p>

<p>I think they want us to be tired and numb.  People work every day and come home with little energy to do anything but watch TV or go online.

<p>You&#39;re right about the new age stuff. But there&#39;s nothing wrong with anger as long as it&#39;s worth feeling it. Righteous anger, is totally justified. I think about Palestine and barbaric Israel and I get so fucking mad I could explode. That kind of anger, in my opinion is worth it because it leads to actions and right cause. 
If I went into a food place and ordered an ice cream and they say, sorry, no more ice cream and then I proceed to hulk out and loose my shit then yeah, that kind of anger is stupid and not worth it. </p>

<p>Life is about balance. Having a foot in both worlds and bringing them together.

Since the dawn of time there has been resistance against tyranny.
 I have no fear. What can they do? Poison me? Haha! 
I am still here, and will continue to be.
Those assholes trouble me as much as a stink gnat.
To be perfectly honest I have more important things to do, than even to consider the fact of their existence. 
Most of the time anyway. lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The hardest part of the matrix to get past is that the point of life is happiness. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  It&#39;s made all the more difficult when the forgers of this civilization put so much undue stress on &quot;being <em>happy!</em>&quot; and confuse most here into thinking that that IS indeed the point of life.  It consciously and subconsciously pushes and pressures many of the humans living on this planet to unduly strive to &quot;at all costs, be <em>happy!&quot;</em> - a thing which causes many to ignore and not <em>really</em> dig in and investigate all the many things about living here that are very, very difficult and that NEED assessment and investigation <em>before</em> any real and true happiness can be achieved.  This lack of true investigation ends up making people even WORSE off than they ever would have been otherwise because they end up ignoring all the baggage they need to address in their hearts and minds before they have any hopes of actually really being truly happy.</p>

<p>Being happy is like getting in shape.  It doesn&#39;t just &quot;happen&quot; magically.  You don&#39;t tend to just &quot;get&quot; in great shape by just <em>wanting REALLY, REALLY badly</em> to be in shape.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>You have to <em>work</em> for it.  Same with being happy:  You have to make sure that you do the work to stabilize your mind and the things in and around your life to justifiably <em>bring about</em> happiness; get rid of the negative people and energy and/OR stabilize your HEART and yourself <em>inside</em> (i.e. mentally and emotionally speaking, etc) so that you don&#39;t get taken off track or are unnecessarily imbalanced.  This takes great, great patience, skill, and a <em>lot</em> of courage, strength, and fortitude because there are often a LOOOOT of things on this planet that get in the way of achieving the state of balance necessary to achieve true happiness.  If one does the work and faces all this darkness and these demons, then one can possibly have real and <em>true</em> reason to be happy and not just be a living in horrible, dark denial to all the real obstacles and challenges around.</p>

<p>Anyway...&quot;rant&quot; over...</p>

<p>Along the same lines, hobbies are a good idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on what the hobby is, I wouldn’t necessarily disagree with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m training to get my black belt in judo next year, studying German, learning new ways to make our home self sufficient, and working on getting more involved in local politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those don’t sound like “hobbies”, sir.  Those sounds like things you’re working on to get yourself better, improve, and grow.  No disrespect to hobbies, but I think these things are a lot more and better than just “hobbies”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exercise helps also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  Very much so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of things I cannot change about how truly disturbing this world really is but if I can make small improvements to my community and make myself strong and keep my wits sharp I might just have the upper hand if the world goes to shit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The world has <em>already</em> gone to shit, my brother.  It seems there’s so much that goes on in this planet that we have very little if any control whatsoever over.  I would say don’t strive to get the upper hand over anything but your own inner self and how you react to and think about the things around you.  It seems we can’t really change the things around and outside of us too much if at all, so strive to make sure that your <em>insides</em> are as right as can be.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like you’ve been well on your way though…so carry on.  :)</p>
