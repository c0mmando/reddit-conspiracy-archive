    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had women tell me I&#39;m &quot;too intense&quot; after a first meeting. Since then, I&#39;ve changed my game. It&#39;s better to just hint around the fringes of modern society&#39;s madness. Come off mysterious, maybe a little aloof, positive about people in general but suspicious and distrustful of authority. Gradually introduce the most obvious conspiracies -- talk about the ongoing trial against salary fixing in Silicon Valley; explain the false flags of the past; bring up all the weird JFK &quot;coincidences.&quot; It&#39;s a slow slog, but you&#39;ll learn whether somebody is open-minded or totally brainwashed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to do a little dance like this if you really know what you&#39;re talking about.  I&#39;ve run into plenty of people that believe the official story about 9/11, but none that did after I talked to them about it.  It&#39;s just a matter of having a deep education, confidence in what you know, and the ability to articulate complicated things.</p>

<p>If you think about it, this isn&#39;t surprising.  Humans are social creatures.  The &quot;defense&quot; side of the official story is just goof balls on TV spouting emotional rhetoric and they know they are lying.  This is picked up subconsciously be everyone.  Someone in person that knows what they are talking about is going to change minds almost instantly.</p>

<p>The same applies for everything conspiratorial beyond 9/11.  Know your subject matter intimately, or don&#39;t try to proselytize.  If you aren&#39;t convincing, you probably don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re saying and are trying to convert someone to your beliefs rather than share with them your knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you. However, I have been down the whole &quot;non monogamy&quot; rabbit whole for years. I have come to the conclusion that it&#39;s all bs. At least for me. We live in a corrupt world who doesn&#39;t know how to keep oaths. Love is a choice and it takes two people to keep it going. I think monogamy is quite natural. I seriously wonder what this world would be like if &quot;to death do you part&quot; literally meant you would have to die to get out. Stupid things like that are why people are not able to learn to think critically. </p>

<p>Yes I have noticed a pattern of polyamorous people having a &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;primaries&quot; that they spend the majority of their romantic time on, but I&#39;ve always been a highly sexual, highly affectionate person that finds a muse in many as I tend to be incredibly loving to living things, and it is physically impossible for one person to do it all for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least for myself, I figured out that the lifestyle was based on my own selfish desires. Selfish needs will never be completely satisfied without the continual need satisfy, like a drug addiction. Nobody chooses to be an addict but they did choose to get high.</p>

<p>To me the lifestyle is no different than something like this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2z6uaw/25_years_old_8_years_of_pied_and_hocd_obsessions/cpga3xf">http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2z6uaw/25_years_old_8_years_of_pied_and_hocd_obsessions/cpga3xf</a></p>

<p>Sure, abuse may not always be an indicator of it, but those people with perfectly healthy child hoods made a choice to start at some point in their life. Whether it was to fill a void from the trauma of abuse or some other unspoken issue that developed. Now they are running around filling the same void to this day because they got hooked. Most people who make the choice to try hard drugs were not necessarily &quot;abused&quot; either. </p>

<p>The brain registers all pleasures in the same way, whether they originate with a psychoactive drug, a monetary reward, a sexual encounter, or a satisfying meal. In the brain, pleasure has a distinct signature: the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, a cluster of nerve cells lying underneath the cerebral cortex. The pleasure associated with an addictive drug or behavior subsides—and yet the memory of the desired effect and the need to recreate it (the wanting) persists. It’s as though the normal machinery of motivation is no longer functioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow ok so I&#39;m selfish and a sex addict for committing to several people and loving them? Like I said, I&#39;m sorry if you had bad experiences with poly, but you seem to be coloring your perceptions based on it. </p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;m not denying I love sex, but that&#39;s really rather rude of you to tell me its all just an addiction I chose to have. Dang. Well, this is what I get for opening up about being poly, a bunch of judgment and someone telling me I&#39;m doing it wrong and I&#39;m essentially a bad person. </p>

<p>I never said that I feel like you&#39;re in the wrong for choosing monogamy in the end, hey, poly just isn&#39;t for you. I simply asked you to please don&#39;t let your personal experience and perception make you think of all non-monogamous people as in the same boat, since it really varies from group to group. I just PERSONALLY feel its unnatural and I think a lot of our ancestors were, so that would be why its a growing thing. If you don&#39;t feel like its natural for you personally, hey, that&#39;s all right!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the one sitting here waxing poetic about how clearly all monogamous people are selfish shits since they refuse to commit to more than one person. I could, but that&#39;s simply not how I feel.  Yeah I can&#39;t really be with other monogamous people anymore, but hey, they&#39;re generally nice people, I have lots of monogamous friends, and we&#39;re all very cool with one another. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m not cool with is the suggestion that fapping to transwomen with penises is an addiction and evil now? Wow. How very transphobic of you. I think this discussion is pretty much over, clearly, you&#39;re either a clever troll that&#39;s kept the ruse going or just a really close minded person that&#39;s letting bad personal experience color your every perception. </p>

<p>I see this sentence as. &quot;I never said that I feel like you&#39;re wrong for choosing to live your life sober in the end, hey, drugs just aren&#39;t for you.</p>

<p>Read my quotes...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At least for myself...</p>

<p>To me the lifestyle is...</p>

<p>This is all my own experience along with everyone &quot;in my experience&quot; We can agree to disagree.</p>

<p>As for the transgender link, you can argue with those people. I personally do not think they are lying and there is a reason why it took will power to stop. Learn more about addictions and the brain. If you want to continue to feed your dopamine cravings in the name of &quot;you can&#39;t just love one person&quot; - that&#39;s coo. The bottom line is whether you want to admit it or not, a simple fact that you just do not <strong>want</strong> -to- <strong>choose</strong> to love one person because that would be inconvenient to your own personal desires. And the people that you choose to &quot;love&quot; will also only be loving you because of their own selfish desires. The whole lifestyle is based off what he/she can get, not give. </p>

<p>It&#39;s kinda like when I also use to smoke weed everyday. I had a ton of friends. We were so loving and sharing all the time. These were my friends for years....until the day I quit smoking weed. Then I found out who really liked me for me as soon as I took weed (sex) out of the relationship. It was like poly to mono all over again. Of course to you this will just be another &quot;bad experience&quot;. </p>

<p>I now choose to be with people that have self control and are able to commit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Monogamic hexogamy is the birth of civilization, in absolute there is no right or wrong, but in practice, certain concept which seem almost individual, have massive impacts at a societal scale, monogamic hexogamy, aka single partner taken outside of the tribe, is one of such changes that turned wars into peace. That&#39;s why it feels natural to do things this way, they might be done another way successfully as we&#39;re attempting, but only time will tell if it makes for a viable societal construct.</p>

<p>Serious answer, internet dating. Or join a cool club. Meetup.com is useful for connecting across interests. Look for a survivalism/transition meetup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Big problem is that young women are, for the most part, heavily influenced by trends and fads and are not encouraged to think outside of accepted norms, and in many cases are not encouraged to think at all.</p>

<p>Another problem is that not all people that accept thinking outside of societal norms share similar opinions.</p>

<p>The only way to find a woman that is compatible with your views is to NOT expose those views when you first meet someone and only gently test the waters as you get to know that person.</p>

<p>Dumping all your views onto someone right away will likely only drive them from you so, again, gently test the waters to see if the person is of a similar mindset.</p>

<p>If they are not, move on because there are a lot of fish in the sea.</p>
