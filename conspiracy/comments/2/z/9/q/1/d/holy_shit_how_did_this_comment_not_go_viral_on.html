       What are you talking about? Circle jerk comments that communicate nothing new nor anything insightful, like this one, get up voted all the time in the main subs like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . This post is the number one comment with 3000+ upvotes and even gilded. Why are you trying to make some grand conspiracy out of nothing?

       I can't quite fathom how people aren't up in arms with even one of these, let alone a plethora of them THAT ARE IN PLAIN SIGHT!
      </p>
      <p>
       It really makes me sad realising that the vast, vast majority of people simply couldn't care less because it doesn't directly affect them and even if they did (which 90% of them do) they're still content going about their lives with their distractions, with their new shiny this and lovely expensive that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the feeling that some do realise what's going on but it destroys everything they've been taught and that the government isn't the big lovable bear they've been conditioned to believe it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope there's light at the end of the tunnel for humanity because otherwise, we're fucked.

       No, I think that these stories have the effect of slowly but steadily dissolving trust in governments. It might take a while, but the effect of it are very much like that of a pending earthquake. You know it will come, but you can't say when or how strong it will be.

       There is an extreme crisis of confidence in the current "bought and paid for" leadership in the United States.

       This "self-licking ice cream cone" of fear, propaganda and greed can't go on forever. These profitable low-level wars that we seem to enjoy so much are about to turn into a "holy fucking shit what have we done" war.

       In my day to day travels, a lot of people really aren't ignorant to a lot of what happens. The problem I've come across is a lack of drive to do anything about it. There are organizations to join, but at a local level here in the mid west, people are content to just live in the system like everyone else and hope for the best.

       There is a pretty good discussion about "conspiracy theory" in the comments of the original post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it amusing how so many people are so far in denial, they refuse to even acknowledge the well-known negative connotation the term comes saddled with, even when they use it in exactly that fashion.

       The term was deliberately cultivated by the CIA during the time when some major questions about the JFK assassination official story were being raised and spoken about publicly.

       I'm weary though. Why now? Why worldnews which is on total lock whitewash down. And politics too? Those subs are usually really propagandized. The sub Technology tends to mirror a lot of sentiments here on conspiracy, at least with NSA, but I don't think that's a default sub anymore. But I am noticing a huge uptick in "conspiracy theory" posts all over reddit. I personally think it's to affect cognitive dissonance. I mean, I hardly care about Snowden posts anymore. I saw so much of it. I kept thinking ok ok ok things are ridiculous, but you hear so much stuff that's all the same flavor eventually you think, nothing is being done about it and stop caring. The other thing was all the police brutality posts cropping up everywhere. When taken together I think the public is being acclimated. When I say public I really mean the reddit demographic, which is broad, but probably share similarities that the government is now actively targeting to influence. What do you guys think?

       It's better that it exploded there rather than here. Not for nothing but here it would have just been clapped at and most would agree. There it's turning a few heads and maybe changing how some people think.

       Let's pretend the illuminati are real, let's pretend they

       like to telegraph the moves they make with overt symbols. This read to me like a victory lap if those things are true. A post in this sub to test the waters, then over to a much, much, bigger sub. And the people upvote it and guild link after link about the death of America? How many are that stupid? How many are members of all those originations that we've read about hiring people to sway opinions on the net?

       The wonderful thing about human nature is, the people in power will always become blinded by their own hubris. Then someone who has a fuck to give hits them when their back is turned and maybe the person that fills the power vacuum is a little more progressive when it comes to the ascent of man.

       Because Reddit is infiltrated, and controled, and biased, and misleaded. If they can set up crazed Arab terrorists and Mexican drug cartels, who chops off people's head whether using small pocket knives or a chainsaw, on a daily basis. And at the point they don't care if it was a female politician and/or torture to death their entire family, includes children. All those bizzare and manic fear based mind control schemes. How easy of a task would you think, for them to manipulate Reddit?

       Because a lot of the things he posted are citing half-truths, blatant lies or incorrect citations. It's a word-vomit pushing a certain anti-America agenda.

       Because this subreddit is mainly centered around lizard-jews and all the other things that have nothing to do with anything important. It's pretty much just here to act as a ward against anyone taking conspiracy theories seriously on major social networking/media websites. That's what
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is used for - either by purpose and direction including a few moderators who make sure the wrong things get stickied and the wrong posts stay on the front page(while the right ones are deleted), or just because the most vocal minorities out there have used this as their entry into social media websites.

       No dude, I have never seen the term lizard-jew in this sub until now.

       The only people I've seen use that term were SRDers or SRSers or people who just hate conspiracy theorists?

       Yes its absolutely psychological projection onto
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , which just makes us smirk and we have the pleasure of knowing that the person that used that terminology is sadly ill informed or possibly just crazy in their own right. This is my first time to see lizard jew myself. I have been here for over five years, I daily read comments from the top down all the way through new, had anyone one seriously said that and were not in here spying for their controllers, they would be laughed at. Well its kind of funny actually and its so fucking out there no one here is taking any of that shit seriously. So in fact SRS may believe in lizard jews, we do not and have never, for as long as I have been here. Huge fallacy, the Ron Jeremy of Fallacies.

       It's not psychological projection, but it is psychological manipulation.

       If I were a government agent tasked with disseminating propaganda, and I wanted to damage the credibility of a forum where my government's policy is frequently discussed in a negative light, I'd post nothing but schizophrenic ramblings, allegations of lizard aliens infesting government, and Holocaust denials - the kind of things most normal people take one look at, and dismiss as lunacy right away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing this, I discredit the entire forum.

       Those guys talking about being gang-stalked by lizard aliens with mind-reading technology are posting from an air force base.

       Because the article was originally from the Jew York Times, which, as you know, is mostly the largest Jewish newspaper organization in the world, so yeah, their bias leans towards their objective of helping the Jewish world, not so much world news, just Jewish news.
