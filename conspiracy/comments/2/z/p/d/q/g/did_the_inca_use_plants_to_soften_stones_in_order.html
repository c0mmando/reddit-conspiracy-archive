      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The modern Peruvians are very fond of speculating as to the method which the Incas employed to make their stones fit so perfectly. One of the favorite stories is that the Incas knew of a plant whose juices rendered the surface of a block so soft that the marvellous fitting was accomplished by rubbing the stones together for a few moments with this magical plant juice!
       </p>
       <p>
        [A]ll through the Peruvian and Bolivian Montaña is to be found a small bird like a kingfisher, which makes its nest in neat round holes in the rocky escarpments above the river. These holes can plainly be seen, but are not usually accessible, and strangely enough they are found only where the birds are present. I once expressed surprise that they were lucky enough to find nesting-holes conveniently placed for them, and so neatly hollowed out as though with a drill.
        <br/>
        ‘They make the holes themselves.’ The words were spoken by a man who had spent a quarter of a century in the forests. ‘I’ve seen how they do it, many a time. I’ve watched, I have, and seen the birds come to the cliff with leaves of some sort in their beaks, and cling to the rock like woodpeckers to a tree while they rubbed the leaves in a circular motion over the surface. Then they would fly off, and come back with more leaves, and carry on with the rubbing process. After three or four repetitions they dropped the leaves and started pecking at the place with their sharp beaks, and – here’s the marvellous part – they would soon open out a round hole in the stone. Then off they’d go again, and go through the rubbing process with leaves several times before continuing to peck. It took several days, but finally they had opened out holes deep enough to contain their nests. I’ve climbed up and taken a look at them, and, believe me, a man couldn’t drill a neater hole!’

       There was an article i read awhile back that discussed acoustic levitation and other cool properties of sound energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the things it mentioned was an experiment where they directed sound downwards into a large dish of sand. To their amazement, certain patterns began to form in the sand due to sounds wave-form. Different patterns emerged for different frequencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a related notion, i found that some of the ancient structures in southern africa resemble the same patterns of this sand-sound experiment. I always wondered if the two were somehow related...

       Interesting theory, yet I find it hard to believe that the birds wouldn't choose another place for their nest. "Drilling" those holes seems a rather time-consuming task. But that's just a quick thought...

       Well I must say that I'm no biologist so my knowledge on this matter is very limited. I just found it strange that the birds are making their nests on the rocks rather than, let's say, on some nearby trees or whatever. Or are there no trees, only rocks, so the birds had to adapt to that environment? Is that what you mean with "adaptation"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway it's very interesting and mother nature surely never stops to amaze me.

       Ehhh i would also go with valuable, credible shouldnt imply the knowledge it should imply the source. Truth doesnt depend on credibility (merit based honour), its an intrinsic value of that which is true.

       Thats kind of what i was hinting at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, a biologist or scientists opinion has more weight to it, given that it is sourced from a combination of their own beliefs as well as all the educstion they have garnered. Hence, credible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to say it is any less (or any more) valuable is a bit disingenuous, as it would be foolish to say that one could possibly think of every explanation/solution to any given problem. Even those who have much less education on a given subject might have something important conjured up in their minds. Sometimes, being less educated helps one to manifest ideas that are out of the realm of academic bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, i dont think we can merit the position that ones opinion is more valuable than any other solely on their resume. Furthermore, one who doesnt have the same education (i.e. indoctrination of thought) and the same connections wouldnt have the same tendency or temptation to falsify or otherwise defraud their statements/findings on a given subject. If they dont have to worry about losing their career by being wrong or by not having much contribution lately, they are more inclined to be truthful.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are factors involved in attributing values to opinions. I find it is almost incalculable to do so, and inherently dishonest in some cases.

       The approach to valuable wasn't an egotistical one of being greater or lesser, its simply thats its valuable based on it has to do with the subject at hand and i dismissed credible based on what i affirmed above. Again for example those not lying for fear of loosing their jobs and those that lie for fear of loosing their jobs, it destroy any sense of truth in "following blindly" or loosely based on merited "credibility".

       Maybe because certain adaptions dont follow human logic, making it seem as if these adaptations are random or are poorly chosen (via natural selection) or somehow dont fit within the human devised concept of paradigms set by Nature herself..

       Referring to it as "human logic" makes it sound as though one must adhere to a certain framework to be thinking logically.  I was curious what thtat framework is(or at least your interpretation).

       What i meant by that is as generalized as possible. That is, what is currently "accepted" by the scientific community; more explicitly the understanding of which that the general population hold as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The context consists of the other redditor asking why some people are fond of evolution, yet cannot understand certain adaptive traits. I was positting that it is because those people follow the scientific consensus, yet are devoid of the understanding involved in the application of the consensus.

       Thats the same thought i had, too... Bit then again many species of birds go through hoops to create their nests when it would seem more logical to nest somewhere/somehow else... So id say this theory is plausible...

       A lot of animals do a lot of things that seem non-sensical to us, with our opposable thumbs and language and computers and power tools...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet if the birds really do that, obviously it's behavior that's learned over many generations and it seems like it would serve to protect the nests, thus the young, from just about anything besides other birds, right?
