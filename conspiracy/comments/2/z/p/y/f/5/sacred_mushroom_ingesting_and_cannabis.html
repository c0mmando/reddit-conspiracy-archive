<p>There were special groups of assassin cults that were trained in earlier times using substances like hashish and they were called &quot;Hashishans&quot; or &quot;Assassins&quot;.  </p>

<p>Although these two practices are not identical, they are similar and related. </p>

<p>While the first example may be considered <a href="http://goodnewscommunications.net/natures-medicine-versus-big-pharma/">early natural mind control</a> in the sense of learning to control your own mind, the second example could be considered manipulative mind control in the sense that the participants were trained under hallucinogens to kill for God or &quot;Allah&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God is man, man is god. These substances allow this understanding that has been occulted since written history. This is the biggest conspiracy of all. What do you think Buddha figured out under the Bodhi tree that made him so enlightened? The Christ whether real or allegorical stated the same thing John 10:34 &quot;Don&#39;t ye know ye are gods&quot;. It&#39;s what Neo alluded to in the Matrix when he took off flying. </p>

<p>Humans tend to worship these beings and give their power away to useless ideologies that disempower themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but I forget the part where I said I had all the answers. I&#39;m like you still searching for truth. This cannot be comprehended without experience, you can shortcut like I did with Pharmahuasca 400mg Harmaline and 150 MG DMT Fumarate in a dark room for 4 hours or you can practice Raja Yoga and or  meditation. I have read it before that man was god before my experience and laughed it off and had 0 comprehension of this idea. Let&#39;s just say an ancient sect of large nosed people have hidden this info from us through antiquity and have basically turned into Satan on this planet. Why do you think the majority of Billionaires have large noses? They have hidden the knowledge and enslaved the rest of us in the process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure, it&#39;s obvious that a lot of this knowledge is hidden... occulted... I can tell they&#39;re keeping us from it, but I can&#39;t yet tell why.</p>

<p>The most rational explanation is that these psychedelic tools help us to question our cultural programming. And they&#39;ve put a lot of effort into that programming to make us good little slaves. We&#39;re not powerless; we&#39;re simply in a bad position, strategically. </p>

<p>But I have a problem with all this &quot;You are God!&quot; talk. It seems counterproductive, making us wait around for our superpowers that don&#39;t exist... when instead we should be making practical steps to undermine the power structures that enslave us.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not Neo. We are a massive army of ants with no leader -- or, rather, leaders that exploit us. Some of us realize this. It&#39;s a good start, but that&#39;s all it is. We need to be working out what&#39;s next.</p>

<p>My point is.. all this vague pseudo mystic &quot;just be God!&quot; &quot;forget all you know&quot; stuff is <strong>not helpful</strong>. It&#39;s not actionable. I have drank ayahuasca many times. I had a peek at another reality. Be more specific. Wtf do I do now? </p>

<p>Whether I am God who is personally omnipotent... or whether I am an ant that requires vast numbers to accomplish anything meaningful... it&#39;s an entirely different gameplan between one or the other. Does that make sense? Let&#39;s figure this shit out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never drank ayahuasca I took pharmahuasca at 5 times the standard Peru dose. Plus 2x the harmaline than a normal pharmahuasca dose. It was THE most interesting, amazing, intense experience of my life. You won&#39;t want to do it again when you do the dose I did, you won&#39;t need to.</p>

<p>While I enjoy most of your posts on this one I am sensing some bad vibes. You seem to get frustrated easily, impatient and a bit immature. Please do not take offense to this but these are the things that must be transmuted to either a neutral or positive force within you. Learn how to manage your emotions allow them yes but don&#39;t be controlled by them. In order to be a god you must become a god. This is as difficult as it sounds. You have a divine eternal unique soul and it must be like a sword tempered, sharpened and hammered until it is perfect. When you attain god hood the powers you want so badly like flying will be a non issue. You will want to serve your fellow man more so than parlor tricks. The power of true belief is key not believing because someone told you like me in this case but by believing through your own research and experience. There is a new movie trailer out that brought me to tears with a little boy who moves a mountain with his belief. This is the best example I can give  you again I&#39;m on the same path of negative removal and perfecting my habits and behavior but I have always treated people well so now I treat them better.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t master nature it will master you. This is done through humility, care and love as everything outside of you is a direct reflection inside of you.</p>

<p>Please understand I&#39;m not a teacher but a student so any more questions please see the greats or look up godself realization etc..we&#39;re in this together I&#39;m no guru man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a little frustrated with the argument you&#39;re making but please don&#39;t misinterpret my disagreement as negativity. It&#39;s just I&#39;ve heard all this before. It&#39;s very New Agey. &quot;We are gods, we just don&#39;t know it.&quot; And then when I call you on it, you switch to &quot;Behold the power of ants.&quot; It&#39;s two completely different scenarios requiring two completely different strategies to implement any real change. Make sense?</p>

<p>Okay... Is there one single human who knows they&#39;re God and who has a shred of goodness in their heart? Just one? If so, I humbly request... for the thousandth time... Please. Fix. This. Shit. Don&#39;t wait for me. You&#39;re God. Fix it. Stop telling me <em>I</em> have become God. You&#39;re already God. Fix. It. K??</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No offense, but this is bullshit. One could argue that Reality is a sum total of the reflection of all people&#39;s hearts, fine. But it&#39;s not just me creating reality. It&#39;s not just you. It&#39;s an aggregate of everybody. And, again, this requires a complete different strategy than if it were just me. Or just you.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m not letting this slide. If you get this wrong, you&#39;re using the wrong strategy to fight evil and, in so doing, you&#39;re neutralizing yourself. You&#39;re just a guy who just sits and meditates and never actually does a damn thing to help. And potentially neutralizing others if they <em>only</em> look inward, <em>never</em> look outward.</p>

In fact I was asked my opinion of ISIS at a very well known university hospital and said the truth yesterday today on my flight home my boss called me to say that if I want to keep my job I&#39;m gonna need to zip it, but I was asked in this situation. In other situations I have conversations with people showing them videos and anecdotes waking up or at least rattling the cages so please don&#39;t be so hasty to judge me.

    <div class="md"><p>It would if our DNA hadn&#39;t been altered. It&#39;s not a drug it&#39;s plants put here for this very purpose. Your forgot the part where I have stated that once this reality was unlocked I have never gone back to it and can access via meditation now. When I tried before with meditation I couldn&#39;t. Also on a heavy dose of mushrooms and meditation combined I saw the seal of God in 4th dimension and never knew it existed prior to that. <a href="http://altreligion.about.com/od/westernocculttradition/a/sigillum_dei_aemeth.htm">http://altreligion.about.com/od/westernocculttradition/a/sigillum_dei_aemeth.htm</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay first this is not an idea nor a belief of mine. I have experienced the god head as have many others in r/psychonaut r/dmt etc... I have also experienced eternal bliss drug free in a meditative state. </p>

<p>Once you realize you are god it takes you on a whole other journey and unfortunately the path is too new to where the re is a lot less info on what to do next. You can&#39;t be told this as has religious beliefs do, you MUST experience it.</p>

<p>After that it leaves more questions than answers. What I&#39;m into now is Kabbalah and Raja Yoga thanks to u/quantumcipher if you would like I can forward you links to the books he sent me but I am just starting in this 1-2 years of this knowledge. Best thing to do from what I know is to align yourself with what you think the creator should be like aka perfection in all you do in mind body and spirit. Then you can worry about flying lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I <em>think</em> I have experienced this in an ayahuasca session. But despite the feelings of empowerment and optimism I&#39;m still left with.. nothing.</p>

<p>If I were God I would imprison all the propagandists and peons, and I&#39;d execute the decision makers. If you were God, <strong>why haven&#39;t you done this yet??</strong></p>

<p>I see this as hyperbole. I&#39;m not God, you&#39;re not God. But we&#39;re not powerless either, as tptb would have us believe. Sure, if we can align 7 billion to one common goal, we can kick some ass. But just wanting it doesn&#39;t make it so. We need to wrest control of media outlets and power structures. Just meditating and eating shrooms ain&#39;t gonna cut it. I see New Age philosophy as profoundly disempowering. &quot;Just fool yourself into thinking the world is different.

<p>I am interested in this material as well as the methodology you mention. I became acutely aware of the &quot;something else&quot; beyond our physical reality when I encountered a man who profoundly altered my consciousness with a sound he made... I am practicing Kriya Yoga now and am looking to be initiated shortly.. Kaballah is another interest although it is way over my head at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, you mention having taken DMT as a gateway to gaining a greater understanding of, shall we say, spiritual truths.</p>

<p>Could you elaborate on why you think (if you do) that DMT is superior or unique to other psychedelic drugs (in particular, LSD and shrooms) for this purpose?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve not yet tried DMT, and I guess I&#39;m trying to determine whether it&#39;s worth the effort of acquiring it.</p>
