        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s hard to find reliable information written in concise, literal English, because there are so many social forces working to hide such blatant descriptions of the truth. But, since art isn&#39;t as accessible to most people, these forces don&#39;t work as hard to limit our access to it; if you can pick up the information in the art, then odds are that you already know a lot about what&#39;s going on already.</p>

<p>Additionally, it&#39;s harder to put lies into good art than into concise, literal English, so art, while less easily interpreted, is likely to be more reliable in truth. There is plenty of true information on this subreddit, but it&#39;s very hard to tell fact from tale because it&#39;s easy to craft a tale in textual form. But, most of the people spreading the lies aren&#39;t capable of making beautiful art, so art is a safer haven.</p>

<p>There&#39;s something happening here
What it is ain&#39;t exactly clear
There&#39;s a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s time we stop, children, what&#39;s that sound
Everybody look what&#39;s going down</p>

<p>There&#39;s battle lines being drawn
Nobody&#39;s right if everybody&#39;s wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind</p>

<p>It&#39;s time we stop, hey, what&#39;s that sound
Everybody look what&#39;s going down</p>

<p>What a field-day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side</p>

<p>It&#39;s s time we stop, hey, what&#39;s that sound
Everybody look what&#39;s going down</p>

<p>Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you&#39;re always afraid
You step out of line, the man come and take you away</p>

<p>We better stop, hey, what&#39;s that sound
Everybody look what&#39;s going down
Stop, hey, what&#39;s that sound
Everybody look what&#39;s going down
Stop, now, what&#39;s that sound
Everybody look what&#39;s going down
Stop, children, what&#39;s that sound
Everybody look what&#39;s going down</p>

<p>What makes you say that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to be a good artist, you have to see a certain amount of truth. It&#39;s hard to explain what I mean--I don&#39;t mean facts. I mean &#39;seeing&#39;. An artist has to be able to see his/her imagination well enough to use it to create art. And people who are good at &#39;seeing&#39; are more likely than other people to have realized enough about what is going on, and life, to see the harm that lies cause, and to desire to spread truth and joy rather than confusion, lies, denial, and subjugation.</p>

<p>It takes a high amount of denial and psychopathy to simultaneously be a good artist and to spread oppression rather than liberation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you take a look at some of the Emmy performances from the past few years, and perhaps further back, you&#39;ll see quite a lot of occult/illuminatiesque symbolism.

<p>Case in point being that much of the shitty, repetitive (imo) mainstream music of today certain contains a lot of dark inspiration. </p>

<p>Completely disagree. Your idea that artists are these magic shamans connecting with some universal truth and sharing it with the unwashed masses is a bit pretentious and out of touch.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need anything special to make art other than the will to sit down and start and never stop. You can make shallow, vapid meaningless crap, you can make propaganda specifically designed to enthrall others, you can make powerful spiritual art that wakes people up, you can be weird al. </p>

<p>None of that has anything to do with some vision quest or any kind of lofty ideas or access to truth or seeing your imagination good enough to create it. Name your five favorite deepest artists and I bet i can dig up them proving you wrong in word or deed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s try not to talk in black and white. Art is a fuzzy concept that nobody can agree upon a definition of. So, what I said applies to a different class of artifact creators than you think of artists as. This means that perhaps, you think I am saying something less reasonable than I am. (To illustrate: consider that perhaps my definition of art was purely the shamanistic love containing works. It is actually not that simple, but you get the point.)</p>

<p>Next black and white thing to fuzzify: Artistic ability and willingness to spread oppression versus liberation are not simply either completely unrelated, or completely correlated. Reality cannot be understood in such brief words. Some artists are extremely talented at what they do, and yet use their art for the selfish manipulation of others. Other artists have experienced profound realizations about life and goodness, and draw motivation and inspiration from these experiences, and channel them into their work, which contributes to its quality. And there are many other types of artists too, each one unique from the rest.</p>

<p>Sorry if I contributed to this miscommunication; I actually agree that this view would be highly idealistic and naive.</p>

<p>At no time did i make things black and white. I&#39;m the one that said art could be any number of things and whether or not it was some shamanic vision of truth or just a stupid parody it was still art. I don&#39;t need a condescending speech about fuzzy black and white interpretations.  You&#39;re the one that said artists had to be able to create their vision perfectly and speak some universal truth and that was part of being a good artist. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t wanna bother. Here is an interview with Alan Moore specifically backing up everything you said: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1qACd0wHd0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1qACd0wHd0</a> </p>

<p>He is a shaman who uses art to wake people up, he believes art is magic and it is the duty of artists to use it to wake people up. Pretty straight forward version of what you&#39;re saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This statement is an example of what I mean by black and white. Black and white is a metaphor, which there is no precise, universal rule for applying, so your understanding of it and mine, while similar in some ways, are not the same. To the point: in my case, it is a fuzzy concept; one is never all black and white, or not at all black and white. Language forces us to be somewhat black and white, but there are different extents to how black and white we speak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m the one that said art could be any number of things and whether or not it was some shamanic vision of truth or just a stupid parody it was still art.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree. You did say those things, and I thank you for doing so, because they are relevant contributions to this thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t need a condescending speech about fuzzy black and white interpretations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m very sorry that you interpreted it that way. I was not angry with you, or of the belief that I was in any way superior to you. You are a human being just as I am, whose opinions are no more or less valid than are mine. Now, I sense anger coming from you, which causes me to feel a bit bad. I hope that you can forgive me for contributing to you becoming angry. On further thought, perhaps I was a bit condescending in my tone, and I&#39;m sorry for that. I&#39;m not very old, and I still have a lot of personality issues that I&#39;m trying to overcome. Thank you for being honest with me about your feelings, so that I may learn to be less condescending.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link. I agree with this cause, but I also agree with you that there&#39;s no &#39;black and white&#39; rule that only awakened people can make good art. All I was saying in my original comment was that I believe that there is a correlation between practicing an &#39;art&#39;, and &#39;waking up&#39;.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, if you&#39;re interested in spirited jamming, I have to recommend live shows by The Grateful Dead as well. A lot are available at <a href="http://www.archive.org">www.archive.org</a>. If you&#39;re new to the band, pretty much any show from May of 1977 is a good place to start.

Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I&#39;ll drag you to your grave
I&#39;m deep inside your children
They&#39;ll betray you in my name</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those tired of mainstream shit music you&#39;ve heard a million times I make dubstep/drum and bass mixes that were all made themed with consciousness expansion in mind.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert but I put my heart and soul and money into it I buy uncompressed straight from the artists when I can. Each mix costs me $50-70.
They all have a theme and purpose but it&#39;s open to interpretation. Some are very hard and dark much like life on this planet but I balance it with humor or softer stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>STEEZ is the shit man, so fucking good considering he was like 18 when he put that mixtape out.  It&#39;s a little bit sketchy to me that the album he finished before he died still hasn&#39;t been released yet to be honest.  I haven&#39;t heard a word about it for months - I also think Joey has fallen off considerably since STEEZ died.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, STEEZ is honestly incredible. i&#39;m with you 100% in regards to his album, i&#39;ve heard a little bit about it recently scattered throughout some interviews that joey has done. i&#39;m also with you in regards to joey as well, i really wish the two of them could have continued to make music together. joey has lost some people recently though (STEEZ, Junior B) so let&#39;s hope that he can recover and put out some more enlightening music. not sure if you&#39;ve ever heard of The Underachievers but they&#39;re worth checking out as well, to an extent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s some sketchiness surrounding STEEZ&#39;s death - I remember he posted a tweet saying, &quot;the end.&quot; or something like that at 11:59 p.m. the night he died (the numerology of which added to 47, obviously a number he had strong ties to). And his autopsy/police report has never been released to my knowledge, and there have been some comments from family/friends suggesting the last day/hours of his life were shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>And then combine all that with his new album coming out, how young he was and the potential he had, plus the positive message and seeming knowledge he already possessed at such a young age?  He was just about to blow up, I think his new album might&#39;ve done it - and now where is it? Delayed multiple times and still not released, will probably get very little attention when and if it ever does.</p>

<p>I dunno, to me there&#39;s something there.  It&#39;s never all added up in my mind.</p>

<p>Forget the politicians. They are irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don&#39;t. You have no choice! You have OWNERS! They OWN YOU. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. </p>

dressed it in drag and pissed on every inch.&quot;</p>
