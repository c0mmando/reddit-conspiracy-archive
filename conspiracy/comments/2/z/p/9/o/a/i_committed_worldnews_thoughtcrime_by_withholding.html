<p>I was also targeted with numerous private messages. Some even asking me what it was like to work for the organization, because they were genuinely curious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  I am for all people having free thought.  The issue is that people are sent in to deceive others through sophisticated forms of sophistry and other types of false logic because it serves their agenda.</p>

<p>Wal-Mart has annual revenues around $480BB.  The US Corp has annual revenues of around $3Trillion.  That is a 6-fold difference.</p>

<p>On one hand, you expect a company like wal-mart to engage in sophisticated manipulation and outright lying to people to their benefit.  Why would you not expect the same from a &quot;government&quot; that has a 6-fold difference in annual income at stake?</p>

<p>And whether you are a shill or have been turned into a &quot;useful idiot&quot; who parrots what the state tells you is of no concern to me:  You are still doing the same damage to everyone else whether you are paid or not.</p>

<p>There is a difference between an honest person who is ignorant of the facts and a dishonest person who would intentionally work to deceive you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wonder why cries of shill are so common then?</p>

<p>My bet is because while people think to themselves things like </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am for all people having free thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a difference between an honest person who is ignorant of the facts and a dishonest person who would intentionally work to deceive you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But as soon as someone disagrees with them they are simply &quot;an honest person who is ignorant&quot; or &quot;dishonest person&quot;</p>

<p>Which in reality negates their entire first ideal, because there is no room left for someone to have free thought, cause they are automatically dishonest or ignorant because they disagreed. </p>

<p>The most interesting part is that most of the people like that don&#39;t even see that is exactly how they are, and will fight like crazy, absolutely crazy against the mere thought.</p>

<p>It must be nice being you and not have to worry about being responsible for your actions and holding others responsible for theirs.</p>

<p>When there is an assault on consciousness, my concern isn&#39;t to protect those who are assaulting us.  Reddit likes to cry &quot;witch hunt&quot;, but the intelligence agencies have released real witches on us.  That&#39;s reality and you better deal with it.</p>
