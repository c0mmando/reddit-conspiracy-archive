       First off, I feel this sub is a good place for this because everywhere else people will just tell me I'm being paranoid for thinking that a company will continue spying on me after I ask them to stop. And, it's likely to contain people who are aware of this kind of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       After I downloaded a load of voicemail apps for my Android Nexus 5 phone, then uninstalled all of them, I noticed that, every time someone leaves me a voicemail, I get a text message from myself containing the transcribed text of the voicemail. I went to the store of my local provider, and an employee tried to fix the problem by doing a factory reset, but I still get the texts. He concluded from this that, when I installed one of those voicemail apps, a third party was given permission to access all of my voicemails, and that furthermore, the only way to get them to stop is to call them up and opt out. However, even if I call all of the developers of all the voicemail apps that I had tried out, and successfully track down the culprit, and get them to terminate the 'service', then, even if I stop getting the text messages, how will I ever know if they forfeited permission to read my voicemails?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also called Sprint about this, and they said they couldn't do anything, and that if anyone could, it would be Google. However, I've just been through their phone support and they, like the guy at the Sprint store, said that my only hope is to call the developer of whatever company is doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really bothers me most about all this is that, I don't even know how many other companies I accidentally gave away access to my data to, and who just didn't provide me of any evidence that they were doing so (like texting me voicemail transcriptions). And, worst of all, neither Google or Sprint seems to have any utility that I can use to see who has access to my data and terminate their access. How many other American phones are being spied on by third party companies whose identities the phones' owners are unaware of?

       Wow. Is that true for all speakers? I imagine it wouldn't work if the speaker used an electromagnet to attract a ferromagnetic diaphram, but that it would for standard electrostatic speakers.

       As for televisions, I think they would be impossible to tap if they were satellite only, because there is no transmission required.

       o.o only hole I see is to think satellites are hack safe. NSA has satelite probes designed specifically to do just that. And China has anti-probes because they've been fighting off those probes from the NSA for over 2 decades now. Oh yeah, we've been playing with the tiger far longer than safe. Good thing we are Iron Man.

       Isn't that irrelevant to the TV owner's privacy? (There's no way for information to travel from the TV owner's TV to the satellite.)

       That wouldn't fix the problem, actually. I did a factory reset, and I still get my voicemails transcribed and texted to me. Resetting a phone is equivalent to getting a brand new phone. Thus, the only way I know how to fix it is to actually change my phone number, which I'm very reluctant to do, because my number is the only way some people have of contacting me.

       I actually already tried doing a factory reset, but it didn't do squat. That's why the Spring guy concluded that my account had been connected to a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really miffs me most of all is that, after the factory reset, my phone still asks me in a synthetic voice to press one before I can answer the phone. It started doing that on the same day that I started getting the transcribed voicemail texts, and kept doing it after the factory reset. And, before you say that malware could have survived the factory reset by hiding in my SD card, note that I have a Nexus 5, so
       <em>
        there is no SD card
       </em>

       I'm actually mostly concerned with parties other than the US government, which I already know there's no escaping from. All my calls and texts are stored by the phone company for quite some time, and the government has access to all of that.

       I'd still rather not give my data away to a company that might not otherwise put in the effort to get my data. I don't think I'm worth that much to them.

       Not if you have really good security, and use an unbreakable encryption algorithm. The problem is that almost no one does this, or even has the knowledge and money to do this. And if you're using a cell phone, 'really good security' isn't an option.

       the problem isn't necessarily that you can't lock your phone down, but do remember voicemails are store on their servers (whomever your provider is)
and your phone calls you might be able to lock down on your phone,but they just basically Man in the middle attack you with their stingray and other similar technologies, sorry.

       In my case, I was told by the customer service person at my local provider's store that my voicemails are first being sent to an unknown company, then sent from there to my provider second. He said that one of those voicemail apps I'd downloaded must have signed me up for that, and that the only way to reverse it would be to call that company and request that they terminate the 'service'.

       The problem we run into is,that in order for a call to even get to your phone,they have to triangulate what phone it's going to, so that means AT LEAST 2 towers, usually a minimum of 3. They can grab the data meant for you right up out of the air, you will not find a way around this period. It's how they keep the phone of the guy on the bus next to you from ringing when a call is meant for you.
In the past even when people have gimmicked around with falsifying IMEIs and the such, you still get located or else you won't be able to receive or make calls.
If they are being sent to an unknown company, maybe that's just their way of letting you know that they are volunteering all of their customers data to a 3rd party (probably govt.) If you are wanting to believe them into thinking an app did this, then you shouldn't be using any app to administer your voicemail,you should use the # they provide off the bat, and leave it at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use a few privacy apps on my phones and i've still been able to locate it from the outside with some homemade detecting equipment that you could build yourself, so don't think there is any surefire way, because again, they'll just grab your data out of the air.
This just sounds like some app is volunteering your voicemail because you probably didn't read the full ToS, and it's probably stated there.
If it's an android phone,unlock and root it,then go install XPrivacy, and see if that will help you, along with catlog so you can see what it is doing. Aside from that it honestly sounds like you willingly installed Ad/Malware on your phone.
      </p>

       You apparently want something like this

       </a>
       but guess what, some hackers already announced that they broke into it as well, so if a company with that amount of funding and manpower can't do it. If Snowden puts phones in the refrigerator because of how paranoid he is, just do what everyone else here is saying. But a couple burner phones that are prepaid, and that's about as best as you can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're already on a list somewhere being watched, they'll just monitor calls coming out of the area of your home and work,and match them up with a voice signature from what you've already talked and the such.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        EDIT
       </em>
       if i were in your shoes,i'd just wipe the phone with a factory reset,put a new ROM on it, with a custom recovery,and then install privacy oriented apps like XPrivacy,Catlog,Android Terminal Emulator,WhisperPush,and i'd browse Xposed to see if there is anything that fits your needs, but this all requires quite a bit of time and effort into learning how to do this, i won't advise you do it unless you really read into it as you can "brick" your phone.

       It can't be an ordinary app on my phone, though, since I did a factory reset and it's still there. However, the voice that tells me to press one in order to answer the phone that started the same day that the texted voicemail transcripts did is also still here. So, maybe I have some kind of super stealthy malware that can survive a factory restore.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my calls being intercepted in the air, I never thought much about it before. I always assumed that the air-broadcasted calls are encrypted. No? What madness is this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I've given up on trying to keep my calls from the government's hands--it's hopeless. But I still would like to take any actions I can to prevent less powerful entities from obtaining it, and that involves making sure my phone provider isn't allowing some third party company have all my data, when they are perfectly capable terminating that company's access permissions.
      </p>

       You seem to know a lot about this stuff, so, do you think the Spring worker was actually correct in saying that my voicemails are now going through an unknown company to get to Sprint, and that Sprint has no way to find out who that is? That seems technologically impossible to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I can't change phones, because that's expensive, and I'm poor.

       If it's still persistent there are a few places the app could backup or hide, also check to see you don't have additional Sprint services activated.

       here are a few diagrams to show you how or where they can possibly hide.

       after doing a factory reset and it still persisting that means it made a copy in your recovery, it is recovering AFTER you factory wipe and then resync with your google services (apps), or it's a service provided by the Operator (sprint).
      </p>
      <p>
       if you want more info on cleaning your phone, i would highly suggest you check out
       <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/">
        http://www.xda-developers.com/
       </a>
       and you can search based on the model of your phone up at the top, or post in the general area with a question regarding what's going on with your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, a LOT if not almost everything on that site can possibly BRICK your phone, so please do be careful.
      </p>
      <p>
       did you recently update the software on your phone through Sprint? (usually called OTA-Over the Air updates)?
       <a href="http://img.wonderhowto.com/img/88/08/63511484372721/0/update-your-samsung-galaxy-s3-newest-available-android-os.w654.jpg">
        looks like this
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll keep checking back to see what info i can provide you with, but when i run into this type of problem on other phones I've checked for friends in the past, i usually just data wipe them and then go into the recovery mode and restart the phone fresh, avoid syncing with google services right when you start the phone up, and check your voicemail right away before syncing to see if that is causing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       a few possible culprits (off the top of my head) are
*Google Voice with cloud based syncing for voicemails
*Sprint Visual Voicemail
*Youmail
      </p>
      <p>
       i'd recommend a factory reset,and then when you get to
       <a href="http://www.geeksquad.co.uk/media/1366804863-large.png">
        this part
       </a>
       skip the signing in with your google account,and don't let the phone connect to a network,don't put in wifi passwords,or enable data
then call your voicemail,or check it
if that remedies your situation,that means it's an app syncing and installing right as you add your google account
you can remove it from another device, or you can sync with it,go into playstore,click on "my apps" in the topleft, and make sure to remove
the voicemail apps you are questioning
rinse and repeat til you either
1)verify it's an app and remove it to remedy this once you datawipe again and then resync it should be gone
2)verify it's not an app and then you can procede to look further into where it could be happening based on what i wrote above

       This reminds me of something. Ever since I became old enough to be aware of government surveillance, I've been reluctant to delete anything, because, if I delete it, someone else might still have it, and I can't

       I was coming at it directly from the idea that knowledge is power. If someone else can reconstruct a better computational model of my childhood brain (using long lost childhood e-text writings) than I can, then I feel thwarted. Is it due to an antiquated sense of pride that the idea of someone who doesn't care well for me has the power to understand me better than I do? If so, perhaps I should let go of something that I've been holding for too long... if only I know what.

       What about Sprint causes you to say that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to use AT&amp;T with an iPhone, but switched to Sprint after fighting and winning a long battle about bogus fees that AT&amp;T charged us. I simultaneously switched to an Android, because iPhone software is absolute horseshit, but now that I'm on Android, I have to say, the stock software, the operating system that you cannot escape, is also awful.

       sorry, i didn't elaborate; my problem wasn't the same as yours, the reason i said that, is because if you are not able to get an answer FROM SPRINT as to why you are having the problem and/or it's not able to be resolved to your satisfaction,
      </p>
      <p>
       i would think the easiest thing to do would be to change your carrier, (AND you can still keep your number) 
if anyone else comes up with a better idea, then do what you gotta do.
      </p>
      <p>
       i only feel this way because, there are other cell carriers, if you prefer Sprint, then, try to work it out, i had Sprint a looong time ago, they were charging me for stupid shit.

       I kind of feel like changing my provider at this point is rather like moving from one prison cell to another, while remaining in the same prison complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the problem would go away if I changed providers, though--I hadn't thought of that. It would be too much trouble at the moment because we're locked in via a contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next thing I'm going to try is to call Sprint again, and this time be more forceful in demanding that, if they don't know of a solution, then please find someone higher up who does.

        This just sounds like some app is volunteering your voicemail
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It can't be an ordinary app on my phone, though, since I did a factory reset and it's still there. However, the voice that tells me to press one in order to answer the phone that started the same day that the texted voicemail transcripts did is also still here. So, maybe I have some kind of super stealthy malware that can survive a factory restore.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my calls being intercepted in the air, I never thought much about it before. I always assumed that the air-broadcasted calls are encrypted. No? What madness is this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I've given up on trying to keep my calls from the government's hands--it's hopeless. But I still would like to take any actions I can to prevent less powerful entities from obtaining it, and that involves making sure my phone provider isn't allowing some third party company have all my data, when they are perfectly capable terminating that company's access permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to know a lot about this stuff, so, do you think the Spring worker was actually correct in saying that my voicemails are now going through an unknown company to get to Sprint, and that Sprint has no way to find out who that is? That seems technologically impossible to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I can't change phones, because that's expensive, and I'm poor.
