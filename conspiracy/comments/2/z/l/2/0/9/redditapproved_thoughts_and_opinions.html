       If it wasn't for this sub I doubt I'd bother coming here at all any more. The top comments on the main subs are starting to get a bit more radical lately though and are being upvoted and gilded for seriously anti-Govt./corporate sentiments, right up to the moment the thread is deleted...

        The reason for your recent comments not showing up is your negative karma. That is a measure applied by many subs against downvote trolls and spammers. It occasionally also hits new users with very unpopular opinions who exclusively post against the grain across all of reddit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Your recent posting in
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        might have been enough to offset the negative karma collected in
        <a href="/r/worldnews">
         /r/worldnews
        </a>
        , so you're probably fine to post in
        <a href="/r/worldnews">
         /r/worldnews
        </a>
        at the moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just try to work yourself into the positive overall karma range or message the mods to get comments approved. Also for the sake of supporting your political position:
        <strong>
         Consider formulating your points in a way that is more likely to be accepted by the community
        </strong>
        , such an approach is much more effective.

       You've never done scientific research! Aside from the fact that science is largely a self-correcting algorithm, it doesn't allow for the existence of spooky scary results. How's that for a fact?

       Are you saying "basic science" proves that fluoride is fine? Well, I suppose it does. "Basic science" tells us why fluoride hardens teeth, however, it is the not-so-basic science that informs us of all its problems, like its effect on the thyroid, on bones, on atherosclerotic plaques, etc.

       Yes, it is basic science that informs us of all of that. If you had taken any kind of medical or biological science courses, you would learn more about these facts instead of spouting psuedo-medical rhetoric that you quickly googled. It's the same line of thinking that is unable to separate toxic substances from toxic levels, as in there's no such thing as a toxic substance only dangerous concentrations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This
       <em>
        basic science
       </em>
       is particularly transformative in the current medical revolution and while big bad boogy men might exist, go back 80 years and get polio and rotten teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And atherosclerotic plaques? You are aware that not all calcium crystallizations are the same, right? I mean, I get you probably know just enough to know why it hardens teeth but probably not enough to know that microcalcifications in the body are not at all like teeth and that in fact, fluoride is used for medical imaging in a wide range of PET and CT technologies. I'm not sure where you're just pulling this things from, but they appear to be from your ass.

       But, don't trust basic science. It's not like since the discovery and development of medical technologies that require
       <em>
        basic science
       </em>
       has changed the entire medical landscape. Boogymen, or something.

       Oh yeah, the term you're looking for is fluorosis. Of which there has been very little documentation of except in extreme cases where people were consuming fluoride from several sources. Again, toxic levels, not toxic substances.

       You know what I notice about scientists? There seem to be two types; the real variety and the pseudointellectual variety. The real variety will take any question or opinion seriously and discuss it with a kind of passion and love of discovery. Even if, for example, the topic is "how
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       homeopathy work?" You know, the kind of thing that the pseudointellectual variety might deride vehemently.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, for example, have written off my assertion that fluoride might have an effect on atherosclerotic plaques without (clearly) looking it up, because you would discover that this has been investigated and the results published (check pubmed).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, before you write me off, not only do I have a 4-year degree in organic chem, and worked in chem labs for years, I have also ghost written about 2,500 published medical research articles.
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       was the one reviewing and telling authors to improve the rigor of their message. I very, very clearly understand the science, the scientific method and many aspects of its communication. I can smell scientific bullshit a mile away and within the body of pro-fluoride research, which is extremely limited to begin with, lurks a great deal of ambiguity and linguistic sleight of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       On my review of the available research, there really is almost no question that fluoride is quite bad for you. The question is really if it's just a bit bad or extremely bad.

       of bullshit that is? That is such a laughably large number that this is practically good for copy pasta, I might use it sometime. The real kicker here is you did all of this with

       Congrats, you have an undergraduate degree. And there isn't anything special about getting a degree in science, it's pretty laughable how little actual science you do while you're an undergraduate. There is absolutely
       <em>
        no way
       </em>
       you were doing reviews and telling authors what to do with a 4 year degree, sorry bud. Not unless you went to some bunk uni that was publishing papers in a local newspaper, not when actual PhD students might churn out 5 papers max during their degree. So, you helped approximately 500 PhD students,

       See, this is why scientists vehemently oppose conspiracy theorists, Dunning Kruger effects and all. You guys think you know so much shit and you don't actually know that much at all. There are sleight of hands in research publications, people try to hide their shortcomings and what they didn't do a bunch. I just don't see why you have to lie about your qualifications.

       I never said I knew more, and there are some things that I am very passionate about. Ask me about cancer stem cells and their mesenchmyal shift trowards pericytes in gliomagenesis and their role in promoting vasculogenesis in recurrent tumors, I'm there. But

      <p>
       And organic chemistry != medicine. You do not own a lab. You do not conduct your own research. You do not have the qualifications to say that fluoride is bad for you (which you clearly misunderstood my toxicity comment because you again said it was bad for you). Your entire comment just screams of "I looked up a research paper on pubmed and disagreed with the results so the opposite must be true."

       Pretty much every result is using fluoride to detect atherosclerotic plaques as fluoride is absorbed in stiffened vessel walls. So, okay, maybe there's an association. Lets look a little further. OH SHIT. TURNS OUT THEY'RE USING RADIOACTIVE FLUORINE IN ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER DOSES THAN WHAT YOU CONSUME IN WATER. AND IT'S FOR DETECTING PLAQUES. OH SHIT, IT'S ALMOST LIKE FLUORIDE IS NON-TOXIC AT LOW LEVELS AND OFFERS BENEFITS. LIKE TABLE SALT. LIKE CALCIUM. WHILE AT HIGHER LEVELS ALLOWS FOR NON INVASIVE MEDICAL IMAGING.

       As I said in another reply, I am not lying about my qualifications. You were the one who decided it's in good character to entertain the academic circlejerk and draw them into question. I simply asserted the truth, the only twist to which is that you're right, I wouldn't normally expect to have gotten the position in the west – it was in Japan and, well, I guess I was the best they could get at the time. I wasn't solely responsible for writing the papers, I worked in a small team to translate an rewrite papers from a number of universities in the Kansai region of Japan, and collaboratively but in a capacity where I was a significant contributor to and had final oversight of 2,500+ biochem and medical research papers.

       The reason that papers and studies like this are largely ignored is because many people in china use fluoride in cooking and various forms of fire, so their intake of fluoride is higher from other sources. I can't remember the source for that right now, but I distinctly remember it as it's an example as to why poor research leads to poor conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, translating is not ghost writing. The only way you could have done what you're claiming is if you translated a single paper every hour for a year, every 2 hours for 2 years, and so forth. Which is by and large completely unbelievable because you claim to be an organic chemist but also fluent in written Japanese? Let's go with that. So your degree in organic chemistry and mystery Japanese fluency enabled you to perfectly translate biochemistry and medical research papers. Sure, let's go with that too. You know, one time I read all of the letter A in the dictionary so now I'm pretty much an expert on any word that begins with that letter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that you become an expert just by reading stuff? It makes you more qualified than hundreds, possibly thousands of researchers all over the world. I mean, there are novel ideas and great discoveries, then there are people that are wrong. How many think they are in the former and end up in the latter? Which do you think you are?

       Er, dude.. why don't you listen to yourself? What's with the straw men? I didn't claim to be a scientific researcher. I'm a science writer with a fair bit of experience in the academic research publication. I.e., someone who can interpret published results with an eye for bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would have said "translator/editor", but that does not encompass the oversight and advice that I gave based on the inclusion, display, interpretation, etc. of results.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing you must be pretty young to not "get" how a person could have more than one ability that takes a while to acquire. I'm old(ish). I studied Japanese for 15 years, and of course lived and worked there. Most people would classify it as fairly ordinary for one to learn to read it in that timeframe.

      <p>
       In any case, you say "The reason that papers and studies like this are largely ignored is because many people in china use fluoride in cooking and various forms of fire, so their intake of fluoride is higher from other sources." Did you get that off the top of your head? If so, clearly you've spoken to someone about this before, AND you sought to 'debunk' them, turning up this indeed irrelevant factoid, since the study correlated the phenomenon with fluoride intake from drinking water and showed a greater incidence of carotid plaques in those with higher intakes. The only way that extraneous fluoride intake would be relevant is if the high intake group happened for some reason to also categorically "cook with fluoride".
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25446012">
        study that showed developmental neurotoxicity
       </a>
       correlated it with dental fluorosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, perhaps some people have genetic abnormality that produces both a structurally modified bone matrix that invites greater fluoride infiltration as well as cognitive abnormalities. Yes, ok. These results aren't yet conclusive, but there are no papers that disprove this hypothesis, so why not entertain it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, that's right. You clearly have some kind of vested interest in the issue to have known (or made up) the "cooking with fluoride" thing.  What is it? Does it relate to something you do?

        I suggest you read this WHO study where fluoride is introduce into other organic residues due to the burning of fuels that contain high levels of fluorine. So, while not directly cooking, I think the fire thing was close enough.

       And I'm not as young as you'd think, but I am fairly, although specifically, scientifically literate in my specific field. I defend my PhD soonish and I have spent the better half of 10 years honing scientific thought and philosophy. Though, I have been fairly well-versed in a great deal of related fields so you saying things like "structurally modified bone matrix," which typically only occurs in metastatic tumors and congenital defects, makes me question scientific aptitude. Cognitive effects, sure, but there are a shit ton of variables to control for in developing countries and when developed countries don't show these problems, it is pretty obvious that the variable being assessed does not play a predominant role.

       I apologize for sounding so hostile, really. I come from an area (Missouri) which has an astoundingly large number of scientifically illiterate people and individuals thinking humans walked with dinosaurs. I'm interested in science discourse and education. Through discourse with local representatives and politics, I have learned to be firm with pseudo science and false equivalences as well as incorrect inferences from data.

       Those usually are bonded elsewhere in the compound, through a covalent bond rather than an ionic bond. It doesn't dissociate in water. But it doesn't affect teeth or anything since it's not a free fluoride atom.

       Yes, but that's because this compound undergoes a reaction that frees the fluorine ion. HF is highly dangerous to people and in water, the F is freed from the bond.

       Ah. I see. Thanks for the information. So basically, when these waste chemicals are dumped into the water supply, F- is the only thing that reaches peoples' bodies?

       They're not waste chemicals if they're dumped with this specific purpose. But yes. The bodies of water are too large to have a significant pH change. Typically small molecules don't have biological activity at this level and the only reason fluoride does is because of a unique mineral reaction.

       So you went from an undergraduate degree, to authoring over 2,000 papers? Some of the most esteemed, tenured professors I know haven't written anything near 2,000 articles. What a load of bs.

       As I said before, I got the job because it was in a non-english speaking country (japan). Also, I worked in a small team (3-4 people) and naturally, we did not provide content, just translation, writing, and an editorial review which included advice on strategies to pass peer review by identifying holes/ambiguities/missing information/poorly represented information, etc., from an SME perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, there are enough unemployed phds in the west such that I wouldn't expect to get the job with only an undergraduate qualification + 1 year of pure research (in Australia, you can do a year of pure research after completion of the normal science degree for a slightly higher qualification).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, of course I didn't do the research myself, I just
       <em>
        wrote
       </em>
       the reports using the original japanese paper, notes + liaising with the researchers, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Got through a few hundred per year, and they added up over time. Nothing really that exciting or superhuman about it.

       I'll try to link these when I can, but the basic points:
      </p>
      <p>
       Europe (other than Ireland)/Japan/Korea don't fluoridate their water and have the same rates of cavities as the US
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple documents from the CDC state that fluoride's benefit is primarily topical (brushing, not drinking)
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the CDC and ADA admit that exposing infants to fluoridated water can cause dental fluorosis

       I think you're misunderstanding Reddit's view on atheism. A lot of intelligent atheists I know from reddit are skeptics who aren't sure if there is a god, but just have not been shown enough evidence to suggest that there is, so they do not believe in it. I know nobody who is coming out and saying with certainty that there is no god, and there is no way that there ever was, is or will be. Those people are idiots. Again, I say intelligent Atheists. r/Atheism is a shithole filled with idiotic 12 year olds. I prefer r/TrueAtheism. Much more actual discussion instead of circlejerking to Carl Sagan and bashing creationists. As for your main point, I agree. The idiotic "there is absolutely no god" people are definitely here on reddit, but I would say that they are in the minority of atheists.

       Yes, absolutely, but most nonreligious people call themselves atheists because they are pretty sure there is no God. Technically, yes they are agnostics, but it just happens that most of those technically agnostic people end up calling themselves atheists, and the term sticks.

       Ugh. For people that get riled up for being generalised as thinking there are lizard aliens controlling the world, you sure are quick to generalise. You're just as much a bunch of circle jerking morons as the rest of reddit. Critical thought my dick - if you're upvoting this you're most likely just a conspiracy fantasist. Fucks me off seeing shit like this. It completely undermines those of us actually trying to figure out what's going on in the world, rather than thinking you know it all already 'cause you read the headlines on this sub.

       o.o I didn't dv ya, and i know where you're coming from, but this third point out here is gonna give you a master badge in dvs, just sayin'. It's okay though, think of them as clicks of hate and ignorance and it makes ya feel a lil better. a lil narcissitic too, but that's okay, you didn't start this ego war, but you sure as hell can win it. =)

       Right. Well I'm going to change my original stance, because ultimately it's not a man vs woman agenda, but rather the dismissal of gender differences. Both feminists and MRAs are picked on, but not with any intelligent discussion involved. Both groups are simply labeled as crazy (much like conspiracy theorists). Maybe the agenda is to avoid social change?...

       I'm not sure Ive ever heard anyone say that Monsanto was good anywhere. I don't understand why eating a

       version of food is bad for you.

       It's not so much the food, it's that the food is designed to not die when you spray stuff on it, meaning you end up eating the stuff they spray on it. Also they sue farmers who save the seeds.

       I agree with the gender points, though.  Reddit is a bit more pro male/anti feminist, but probably mostly because of the huge male demographic.  I think if you were to analyze the bias per gender, you'd have a higher pro woman bias.

       And Reddit is pro-male in ways its users won't ever understand: most Redditors assume one has to come right out and say, "women are the weaker sex and men are superior" for it to be labeled sexism. So much of the site's sexism is subtle: the "don't stick your dick in crazy" quips, the repeated assertion that "false rape claims should be prosecuted" (which completely ignores the reality around reporting rapes in the first place), minimization regarding why so few women hold important offices, that if Hillary Clinton were elected it would only be because "people want to see a female president"... I could go on and on.

       Are you fucking drunk? Like 80% of these opinions are the exact opposite of what gets upvoted on reddit. I bet you think you're some unique genius who is seeing right through mainstream media and bravely espousing what you think are unpopular opinions. Stop being a contrarian loser and get a job.

       The land wasn't stolen, it was Britian's, and the British saw fit to give it to the jewish ppl to make a state where they didn't have to worry about being excuted by a bunch of ppl that didn't want them there like they were in Germany. And ofcourse, it worked out perfectly, since the muslims accepted thier jewish brethern with open arms and hearts.

       Well, techincally, they're right, and since the bike does belong to britian because britain beat me down and took it some time ago. Either way, I'm not killing ppl over dirt. And I in no way have criticized the muslim ppl, like ever. Infact, I am quick to point out errors of belief in others of thier nature as much as I am for the jewish ppls and blacks and anyone else that gets lumped hated on around anywhere.

       One thing I actually noticed was the "guns bad". Yes, l follow a few gun forums, but even in the big subs I've seen plenty of people defending guns and gun rights, so I'm not sure that one is as black and white.

       Right, people are always willing to be skeptical about things they already dislike.
      </p>
      <p>
       True skepticism is the ability to look at your own beliefs skeptically instead of only applying this critical thought where it is easy and doesn't cause an existential crisis.

       9-11, was it an inside job? Was it a lucky strike by horribly disorganized terrorist? Or is our actual enemy, and the mastermind of 9-11, an enemy that we have failed to recognize or understand?

      <p>
       The big bang theory, is it the best working model we have? Is it the method with which god created the universe? Or is it just another competing creation myth that is all dressed up in science?

      <p>
       People tend to gravitate towards absolutes because it makes us feel superior to know what's really going on (wink wink).
      </p>
      <p>
       I tend to shy away from that since its let me down so often, I like to think that there are no absolutes, no constants and no reason to hold onto such things so desperately.

       Scepticism is Bad no matter how logical your reasons, but disagreeing with things that aren't popular or mainstream is Good, even if your reasons for disagreeing make no sense. That's not a Reddit thing, though. That's society in general.

       That's the issue. They didn't. No one said they did. What science says is that something much much much less advanced evolved from smaller single cell organisms, that then evolved progressively over hundreds of millions of years into something more and more complex, which then became fine tuned through survival of the fittest to resemble what we now know as our brain.

       Yeah, I do. It has evidence, and we know cells evolve and adapt. It's a mix of known biology, logic and theory that this eventually led to humans over billions of years.

       Your religion of chance existence strikes me as more nonsensical than my religion of intentional existence, but it's all personal opinion / logic, etc.. there is no 'definitive' answer, as yet.

       Skepticism is the opposite of atheism.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the "mainstream" version of skepticism, which basically means running along with the politically popular status quo until it isn't politically popular anymore.  (ie: global warming is beyond doubt manmade, GMOs are 100% safe, metabolic differences don't real, false flag attacks don't happen anymore because reasons, etc.)

       So in other words, instead of everyone thinking the same thing
       <em>

       I know we got atleast 3 fellow believers on this sub, and i imagine more, because like the one pastor says at the end of a wonderful vid on why the kjv is the definative version of the bible, because those things in Rev describe a conspiracy, so anyone who read it with understanding, is by default, a conspiracy theorist now. Which is why they are demonizing the movement. The more christians that wake up to what the world is today, the larger the tin foil hat group grows. And it's not like we're all locked down in the basement wrapped in tin foil, hidden away. You'd be surprised how many "conspiracy theorist" were quite successful. George Carlin, Micheal Jackson, Dave Chappell, President Regan and Ford, etc etc

       I don't really bash believers as such but I'll be damned if I don't question them harshly. The Old Testament is partly based on the legends of the very religions it demonises, for instance. The serpent represents wisdom, wisdom is neither evil nor good, your application of wisdom dictates it's morality, for instance.

       actually wisdom is both good and evil, that was the original name of the fruit, the knowledge of good and evil. not wisdom or free will as some would like to make it out to be. And thank you for not bashing, any true Christian will be more than happy to answer any geniue question, so question as much as you feel need. And the OT can be hard for some to understand because of some of the actions taken by the LORD in it, but as a believer, I know in faith He does what He does for reasons more just than any mortal mind can comprehend. We see life in a blink, He sees the existance in totally, and therefore might commit to a move we wouldn't agree with at the time, but in reality, it's a long term positive in the LORD's design.

       Depends which Lord we're talking about really doesn't it? One Lord wanted us to live in ignorance of good and evil and remain in a state of slavery, and the other wanted us to be free and aware of our true situation. The serpent was vilified for a good reason yet 'we' worship the enslaver still.

       God never had Adam or Eve labor a day before the fruit, so that's bs that you would suggest the Lord saught thier slavery. He simply wished to spare them sin, but always knew at the same time that eden was a temporary situation for a multitude of reasons I would be more than happy to discuss. And the serpent wanted to corrupt man so he could be made flesh and rule this world as Adam was originally intended to do.

       Until you have properly researched the true origins of your beliefs, the teachings that will not be found in Churches and Bible class there can be no worthwhile discussion. I recommend reading the
       <a href="http://www.historywiz.com/flood.htm">
        legend of Utnapishtim
       </a>
       who was instructed by Lord Ea (the serpent of Ahbrahamic religion) to build an ark for 'the seed of all living things' to save us from the flood (sound familiar?) and the legend of Sharru-Kin (King Sargon of Akkad), who was placed in a basket of reeds in a river as a baby... So much of what we are taught as truth is a mishmash of much older legends picked up by the Israelites in their travels and enslavements. Let's not even begin a conversation about a certain Anointed Essene preist who was co-opted by the Romans to represent their global control system. You won't enjoy it ;)

       I hate this. We're having a convo and you go straight to assumption. Assuming I got my teachings only from churches and bible classes. That i haven't done my own research. So frustrating. I know, you didn't mean to, it's an exposed nerve, you couldn't have known.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Deep breath

       K, sorry about that vent, let's take this convo forwards, I'm familar with Sumer teachings, and know that they don't predate the works of Enoch, who would tell us quite a bit. He would also point out that the area that is giving you your version of history, was where Cain retreated to. So, take that for what it might be.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you assumed me again. Damn it Alien, don't talk down to me, I didn't do anything to deserve that shit. K? We can talk about it, and I won't get mad so long as you don't put thoughts in my head and words in my mouth that arn't actually there for the sake of arguing when I would much rather have an enlightening discussion.

       Sorry Jedi, but your textbook 'The Lord has a Plan' comment got my hackles up a bit, that
       <em>
        usually
       </em>
       means "LALALA I can't hear your evil words" in my experience, I apologise for that. Venting accepted. I guess I'm just a Satan in the original meaning of the word, an accuser. I'll never be able to accept JVHV as our saviour or even that he likes us though, the truth is evidently quite the opposite in my experience. Enoch was a preist of the Annunaki too and the 7th King on the King list not the 1st, lol, I can't help it.
       <br/>
       Edit: JVHV? Jod Vav He Vav? Hehe, you know who I meant.

       That's not the same Enoch, that Enoch, the 7th king you refer to, is a child of Cain, not Seth. o.o Just sayin.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not the only time a Cain names thier kid after a Seth line. This was done by the enemy to confuse, and it works pretty well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry about the hackle upping, and I understand, that ppl use "the Lord does what He does" to avoid having to think about it, which is counter to what the Lord requested we do, which is ask, so He can answer, seek so He can impart.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's okay if you won't accept the Lord, because in the end, I think we all will, and it'll work itself out in the right way. But in my personal experince and in the history i've studied, I can confidently say God is Love, and Love is always kind, patient, and understanding. So even though you might be at odds with Him, that doesn't mean He is with you, because He knows your heart, and if your heart is to serve the good, the light, basically follow the big 10 (don't steal kill destory make yourself or another God or be greedy is what they break down to in simplicity), then He'll know it's not Him you were against, but the version this world beast system has worked very hard in creating of Him.

       I'm absolutely not against the God of Love, our
       <em>
        true

       saviour, it's just that I disagree about exactly who we're referring to here. The compound God of the Christian faith is basically a fabrication by the Judaic priests to disavow and negate the rich history of the religions that preceded and ultimately inspired them. I do right by Anu though and that's what will matter in the end.

       This. It will be Reddit's downfall. Once it totally becomes a controlled medium, as they all are, it will begin a downward spiral that cannot be stopped. Are you listening, owners of Reddit? This cannot continue. You are allowing your cash cow to be slaughtered, one moderated cut after another. Allowing, or directing? Social media slow suicide? One way or another I see Reddit becoming the next last best thing if it continues on this cancerous path.

       The whole point of reddit is that it is largely decentralized. It can't even be a controlled medium since it is entirely user controlled. Even moderators are users. It's not like there's an evil board of reddit that meets in a dark conference room and decides what people do and don't see on reddit. Hell, reddit isn't even profitable, and therefore can't be a "cash cow." It runs entirely on donations and users buying gold, which is donating. I don't even understand what the fuck you are even suggesting anybody does about it. It's not like the CEO or anyone in charge of running reddit's servers has any power over what the content is. Do some research or thinking before you start predicting the downfall of a website that won't be going down until something way better comes along.

       It's simple and dead on. Reddit is bi polar.  The pendulum swings from resource for self directed learning, motivation and support for positive life change and community building all the way over to incestuous circle jerk.

       I have no doubt at all that there are some users who are on one payroll or another, but not everyone who questions is. So why is it assumed that everyone who questions this sub and validity of some of the statements is a shill? Why is any question about the veracity of the information being presented immediately disregarded as being the work of a disruptor or either a government or corporate shill? Is this another manifestation of the paranoia from within the conspiracy community? Any questioner must, by extrapolation of zero data, be paid to question and not just blindly accept the statements made?

       Your response to the question about whom is paying whom makes no sense. You accuse people of acting dumb because they're being paid to come here and act that way and all that comes in response to the question of whom is paying is drivel that makes no sense.

       it's a love/hate relationship. o.o someplaces it's auto upvote, some it's auto down. I think that's why OP didn't include it, because it's not as black and white as the points he listed.

       The land wasn't stolen, it was Britian's, and the British saw fit to give it to the jewish ppl to make a state where they didn't have to worry about being excuted by a bunch of ppl that didn't want them there like they were in Germany. And ofcourse, it worked out perfectly, since the muslims accepted thier jewish brethern with open arms and hearts.

       The reason that papers and studies like this are largely ignored is because many people in china use fluoride in cooking and various forms of fire, so their intake of fluoride is higher from other sources. I can't remember the source for that right now, but I distinctly remember it as it's an example as to why poor research leads to poor conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, translating is not ghost writing. The only way you could have done what you're claiming is if you translated a single paper every hour for a year, every 2 hours for 2 years, and so forth. Which is by and large completely unbelievable because you claim to be an organic chemist but also fluent in written Japanese? Let's go with that. So your degree in organic chemistry and mystery Japanese fluency enabled you to perfectly translate biochemistry and medical research papers. Sure, let's go with that too. You know, one time I read all of the letter A in the dictionary so now I'm pretty much an expert on any word that begins with that letter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that you become an expert just by reading stuff? It makes you more qualified than hundreds, possibly thousands of researchers all over the world. I mean, there are novel ideas and great discoveries, then there are people that are wrong. How many think they are in the former and end up in the latter? Which do you think you are?
