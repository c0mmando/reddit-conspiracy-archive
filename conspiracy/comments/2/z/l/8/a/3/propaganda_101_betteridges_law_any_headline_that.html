<p>Repetition works BEST when people are paying little attention!  Bombarding them with 1 sentence (false) headlines that they dont take the energy to try and refute, or even think twice about, is a great method for brainwashing.  Hell, nowadays people don&#39;t even read the storys!  and that is exactly what they want to happen... because the answer to the question in the headline was NO.

<p>How many times have any of yall heard something like this on the news?:
&quot;Is (insert person/group youd like to slander) trying to deny YOUR ability to have a happy life?,  More on that after the break!&quot;<br/>
well... saying stuff like that over and over has a dramatic effect on public opinion, REGARDLESS of if its true or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of off topic in a way, but earlier this year while watching TSN (ESPN Canada), they asked the question before going to commercial break, &quot;is there a goaltending controversy with the Toronto Maple Leafs? Find out after the break.&quot; </p>

<p>After 4 mins. of commercials and a 3 min. &quot;Investigative&quot; report, it turned out that, no, there was no controversy (why bother with the fucking report then?!). I couldn&#39;t believe the sad and transparently superficial state of mainstream television, and this FOR SURE also applies to &quot;main stream&quot; news.</p>

<p>Anyone who didn&#39;t waste 3 mins. of their life watching that report probably assumed there was in fact a goaltending controversy... And that&#39;s the plan!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God, I remember the same thing when ESPN couldn&#39;t get enough of Jameis Winston stories.  &quot;Winston steps in it again, hear the latest incident coming up next!&quot;  when it turns out it was just round 14 of people freaking out that Jameis wore his uniform while on the sideline of a game he was suspended for, a week and a half prior.</p>

<p>They did their best to make sure it sounded like he was stepping in it every other day.  ESPN, in all of it&#39;s forms, is the worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also this:  If there are misspelled words or punctuation/syntax errors in the first paragraph, literate people are not supposed to continue reading.  For news that cannot be buried, intentional mistakes thwart reading things that must be published.  There was a time when this was a paid service, provided by gentlemen, to provide publication, and also undermine veracity.  This goes on today with impunity, and, if you find these errors, read these articles carefully, because you are not supposed to.  Overriding spell check on a front page is no fucking accident.

<p>To me it isn&#39;t even the tactics and techniques themselves that are crazy - most of them are logical and simple to understand - it&#39;s the ingenious and insidious ways they&#39;re used in the world around us that&#39;s crazy.</p>
