       George.. you have your shit together.  I know you have an understanding of these things.  This isn't meant for me and you.  I also respect that you were one of the first (that I remember) to call out snowden for what he is.  You influenced me to get on-board with that idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see where we are and where this road leads to, but most, for various reasons, don't even understand the truth of their own situation at present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you are willing to become some sort of covert assassin, the best guys like us can do is try to spread the truth and offer a more realistic way of viewing the world to others.  I'm not a violent person, so you can guess which one I have chosen.  You're doing a good job.  :)

       Tell me — what evidence would you show someone who said "the Government spying on US citizens and collecting all internet traffic is a conspiracy theory and not true" and that you could not prove it.

       The answer is: Snowden files.

       Really? With that answer you just conceded to my point that without Snowden, you could
       <em>
        not prove
       </em>
       the NSA/Govt was storing and recording all domestic telephone/internet communications like Skyle, AOL, Facebook, Verizon and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot bring forth the answer "common sense" in the court of law or public opinion when discussing illegal and unconstitutional wiretapping — you need leaked hard evidence and thanks to Snowden we now can shut up the deniers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop trolling
       <em>
        please
       </em>
       . Without Glenn, Laura, and Ed, we would be considered conspiracy theorists.

        Instead we now have major companies like Mozilla, Yahoo, ACLU and Wikipedia fighting the NSA.

       If you replace the words 'national security' with
       <em>
        corporate security

       , you have your answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       National security is just a euphemism for political, economic, and military hegemony, and all of these institutions are closely interrelated. But it has nothing do with the

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the socio-political organization of a society by major interest groups, or corporate groups, such as agricultural, business, ethnic, labour, military, patronage, or scientific affiliations, on the basis of "common interests."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And common interests here should be defined as the interests of the ownership class, and NOT of a nation of everyday workers like you or I. They don't give a fuck about 'the nation.' To them, we are just cattle headed towards their meat grinders.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the biggest threat to this
       <em>
        corporate security
       </em>
       , is us. Not the so-called 'terrorists.'  Stifling social change and social movements is imperative to capitalism and the continuation of the status quo.

       Israel gets our data just like every other security industrial complex apparatus does. They are all one big happy family that's after your data to find out who is falling in line, and who isn't.

       Absolutely... "national security" would also include "economic security" (that's why they used such a broad term).  This provides justification to kill people so that their friends can steal their resources.

       Short, politically incorrect answer:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish community in America are not really Americans. They care far more about Israel than they do the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so ironic. Jews are perhaps the richest, most powerful, most connected ethnicity in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, the typical Jew pretty much hates America, American people, and obviously - by funding and voting habits - cares far more about the foreign nation of Israel than they do our country, America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet if you call this disloyal racist group out, that is a "canard against the Jewish people" because other people throughout history have noticed Jews behaving this way. Thus, anti-semitism/nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no criticizing Jews. They are the victims and have no power in America. It's actually the fault of White Racist America - flyover country Christians who are nothing but little Nazis just waiting to go all Hiter and Holocaust the poor Jews - Uncle Schlomo wasn't even invited to the Presbyterian Golf Club back in the 1950s!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I have this sob-story right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, Israel continues their open genocide against Palestinians people - thanks to their JEWISH fan club here in America.

       Sort of, but just follow the money and influence.  The Vatican is the largest landowner on the planet and has millions of loyal followers, the BIS (central banks' central bank) had 60 members last time I checked, the UN has close to 200, IMF also close to 200, NATO close to 30 and its members account for a wide majority of global military spending.

       I'm thinking along the lines of central banks, mostly owned by the Rothschilds, and a few other select families.  Its always amazing to me to think about how crazy this idea sounds.  Based on the experience of our mostly normal, boring, American lives, it does sound crazy.  But look through history, there has always been conquerors, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and others like them.  Why is it so hard for people to believe that the next great conquerors simply became more effective, secretive, discreet, and technological in their warfare and attacks.  When you think about it this way, its not a stretch to think there is a small group of people controlling things.

       Thanks for the link, good information to know.  I wasn't implying that I was the only one who thought that.  Obviously I wouldn't have had this conversation with you if I was the only one who thought that.  I was just saying that the majority of people would dismiss the idea that, "the world is really run by secret "Illuminati" (using that as a catch-all term here), as being ludicrous.  When in reality, even based on factual history, the idea isn't too far fetched.

       Probably because Israel is a US client state functioning as our(the west's) outpost in the Middle East in the last remaining portion of human civilization that isn't assimilating with the western system of finance/law/etc. - that being the islamic world on the arabian peninsula - and Israel is the client state used to keep them in check(which is probably the reason it exists in the first place seeing as the nobility of the west had thousands of years to "give jews a state" but didn't until 50 fucking years ago, and even then they were given an inhospitable wasteland surrounded by their worst enemies).
      </p>
      <p>
       But no you know I'm sure you guys are right and it's much more likely that it's just evil jews trying to take over America and Americans are just too dumb to see it, you guys are just so smart I wish I could have your level of intelligence and discernment when it comes to the highly nuanced subject of world politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       As nice as it must be for all of you to have 1 particular enemy to blame for all the world's ills or for America's ills(who comprise 0.2% of the human population, jews, that is), it isn't actually true and the world isn't actually as simple as you all wish it was. There are whole websites dedicated to your (wrong) frame of mind, but this isn't one of them, so stop trying to push your handicapped ideology onto reddit. It isn't that we're brainwashed, it's that you're being dumb and focusing on one pixel of a larger picture while thinking you have the whole think mapped out and understood, when really you don't at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think somehow magically, just out of nowhere, .02% of the world's population suddenly was able to control world superpowers? It's the other way around, bros. Their (israeli) behavior is tolerated and helped by the US because of the larger purpose that they are probably meant to serve out there in the middle east. The Israelis know this is the case and so they accept the situation but do so grudgingly/spitefully(which is why they shoot at our ships if we, the US, try to get too hands-on in our control over them). That's also the reason they can "get away with" doing things like that. They're like an important piece on a global political / economic chessboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is America's little brother who is out playing in a hostile sandbox that they are there to be a stabilizing(or unstabilizing) factor in, because the west needed to have a way to exercise military authority over that region and the jews needed a country and had pre-existing cultural narrative that made them perfect for the job. Trying to put them up on the pedestal that you are is a lot like blaming a witch for an illness you come down with, sure, there are "wiccans" and people who call themselves witches, but they don't actually do what you think they do and they aren't actually in power over your illness or health.

       They were used to take over Palestine while being backed by the British and the American governments. "They" didn't do anything, they did what they were bid to do by others and got a state out of it(one surrounded on nearly all sides by their enemies).

       Good job proving that you can't actually rationally respond or defend your own position, it's what all of you "blame the jews" or "blame Israel" guys do when someone tries to engage you rationally. You run away or resort to a. trolling or b. copy &amp; pasting rhetoric from your favorite israelis-are-evil websites - you never respond to the actual points being made, ever.

       You can't make an argument that doesn't focus on portraying Israelis as "victims".  It's retarded and people don't care.  It's a non-argument.

       Us goyim just don't have the nuance needed for understanding the very complex issue of Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it's not like Jews are a racist group of genocidal settlers as we speak murdering Palestinians and stealing their land.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are Jews, thus historical anti-semite holocaust nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we need to tread very carefully when criticizing the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine - or their Jewish patrons in America.

       you're being brainless and throwing in terms that upset
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       to try to be provocative in place of having anything of actual substance to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is, most people aren't dumb enough to be upset by whining faux-racism like including "us goyim" at the start of your sentences. There's a reason your views don't gain traction, and it's because you're just being an idiot and you don't really say anything at all beyond "Israel is evil jews are evil", which is a wholly pointless thing to use your time/energy/life on. So.. congrats I guess. Nothing you say seems to have any meaning at all, it's like the level of communication that inmates in a prison would have, based in petty emotion and whining that has no actual substance and communicates nothing to anyone except the low-level of mental functioning inherent in it's source(you and people like you).
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, apartheid is bad, yes, people abuse other people, but no, that doesn't mean that jews or Israelis control the world and it's crazy to think that.
