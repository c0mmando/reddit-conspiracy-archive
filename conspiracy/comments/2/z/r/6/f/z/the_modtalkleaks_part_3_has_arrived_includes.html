        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No chance of PI this time, so you may link the information contained therein. The leak basically describes a mod/admin plan to create a subreddit called <a href="/r/stuff">/r/stuff</a>, get it defaulted, and then run it to their liking using a wide network of moderators &quot;friendly to their cause&quot;. The leak includes documents which list all of the mods and admins involve din this scheme.</p>

<p>From the words of the source himself;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, let&#39;s talk about something called <a href="/r/Stuff">/r/Stuff</a>. It was a plan between moderators and admins to manipulate the front page and various subreddits to create a default community entirely to our specifications.</p>

<p>A while back, me and some other moderators in Modtalk started discussing this idea of recreating <a href="/r/Reddit.com">/r/Reddit.com</a> (a catch-all default subreddit). We had <a href="/r/misc">/r/misc</a> and <a href="/r/self">/r/self</a>, but they were deemed not good enough. So we went to some admins with the idea and got a couple involved. We got everything we wanted: guaranteed quick default status, free advertisements (here&#39;s our mockup sidebar ad: <a href="http://puu.sh/gIGrE/28ecd3f324.png">http://puu.sh/gIGrE/28ecd3f324.png</a>), and their seal of approval. Of course, we had to keep everything quiet. This began <a href="/r/Stuff">/r/Stuff</a>.</p>

<p>Through some skype and mumble calls, plus meetings on Snoonet&#39;s #Stuff IRC room, we created everything from the rules and ban lists (published below), lists of trusted moderators (published below), subreddits we could rely on for linking/etc (published and expanded below), and more. We needed subreddits and its mods for our strategy, which was to plug <a href="/r/Stuff">/r/Stuff</a> in every big subreddit we could. Submissions, sidebar, stickies, whatever we could do. Whether it was against the rules or not we would make it known and make sure the mods were cool with ignoring that. Normally such a campaign would be against reddit&#39;s spamming rules, but again, we were acting above the rules. Coincidentally, we even used the #Stuff IRC to post #Modtalk logs sometimes. By using such a massive hidden network of moderators we could manipulate the entire community quite easily.</p>

<p>Anyway. We had everything figured out. CSS mods, mods who knew everyone, mods who had good connections with admins, admins themselves, mods who worked with bots and stuff, experienced automoderator people, all that. Essentially, we were colluding with everyone to create the perfect subreddit (in one view, anyway) for the quickest default status and a chance to completely own a new default subreddit. The rules themselves were pretty simple. We mostly just took a few rules we liked from subreddits we moderated and put them together. No memes, no soapboxing/personal army/etc, no bigoted/abusive comments or posts, no sob stories, that sort of thing. Of course, we had an understanding that these were more like guidelines than actual rules. They always are. Some mods wanted a more censored approach, some wanted a more hands-off approach. My plan was separate from others. I was going to use <a href="/r/Stuff">/r/Stuff</a> as a way of changing the mod community by experimenting with my ideas that they considered extremist or downright wrong. Justifying bans, not shadowbanning everyone, treating users as people rather than inferiors, stuff like that. It was easy to talk my way into the top mod spot, which made the plan possible. Otherwise one of the others would&#39;ve banned me the moment any of those ideas were brought up.</p>

<p>In the scenario being discussed, I do <em>not</em> see that happening. </p>

<p>1- It would be way too obvious what was going on. That would be like the government trying to pass a law next week banning any talk of the JFK assassination, or conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>It sends a clear message, and that message is &quot;We don&#39;t like this type of speech. It <em>concerns us</em>, and don&#39;t want it around.&quot;</p>

<p>And then people wonder what exactly they&#39;re so  worried about. Which is the exact thing they <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> want people wondering.</p>

<p>In other words, it validates / legitimizes the conspiracy talk.</p>

<p>2- For all the reasons listed above, <strong>ridicule</strong> is a far more effective technique. &quot;Let them talk-- but make them look stupid.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, someone doxxed the source of the leaks and even went after his family members it seems, which is really fucked up. Obviously that doxx will not be allowed here, and anyone who posts a link to it will be banned and reported to the admins. </p>

<p>That said, XM did say in the <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.rizon.net/#/r/conspiracy">#/r/conspiracy chatroom</a> that the information that was used in the doxx had only been given to one or two people so he had an idea who was behind the attack. </p>

<p>What these people who are attacking XM fail to realize (or refuse to realize), is that the more they attack him, the more he will release. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t use AutoModerator shadowbans to secretly ban specific users, except for one user who isn&#39;t technically breaking any rules, but still a major nuisance. Ask AATA, he can confirm that our AutoModerator shadowban rule looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>## Shadowbans
type: comment
user: [&quot;-moose-&quot;]
action: remove
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p>Apart from that we do remove comments by accounts with overall karma that is far in the negative which is sometimes interpreted as a shadowban by those affected, for example <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2yut24/rworldnews_mods_have_gone_on_a_banning_spree/cpd67fu?context=3">here</a></p>

<p>That being said we have lots of problems with ban evaders. Realistically speaking if someone doesn&#39;t want to follow the rules they simply create a new account, thus rendering bans completely ineffective. I understand why those shadowbans are so popular with other mod teams. The bans just tend to never be reviewed and are also prone to be abused, that&#39;s why we&#39;ve decided against using them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I am listed in the &quot;<a href="http://a.pomf.se/zsfmvt.txt">Link to thos accused of being involved in the plot</a>&quot; and the spreadsheet, but this is the first time I&#39;ve heard of <a href="/r/stuff">/r/stuff</a> or this proposal, so have to assume that list was mostly brainstorming or something.  It is possible I read other discussions about it in the default mods sub back when I was a /wn mod, but I don&#39;t generally pay a lot of attention to those kinds of discussions and don&#39;t remember it.</p>

<p>So far as I recall, I never, ever had any discussions, public or private, with anyone about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that struck me as odd too. I didn&#39;t recall you and Pharn being in with that either. I think that &quot;list of those involved in the plot&quot; was aspirational. And what&#39;s more, on the spreadsheet they had you on the spreadsheet as &quot;not reliable&quot; (which was as insulting as laughable, IMO). Clearly they have no idea which end is up, let alone knowing the difference between fantasy and reality. No wonder there&#39;s no <a href="/r/stuff">/r/stuff</a> to this day. </p>
