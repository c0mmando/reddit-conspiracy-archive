       My history teacher in High school (one of my favorite teachers back then) used to always tell the class: "if it's one thing history has taught us to control the masses you must keep them poor and religious."
      </p>
      <p>
       Something that really sticks with me to this day years later. It is scary how true it is.

       There's a flaw. By singling out religion, people forget the obvious replacement that fulfills the historical role of religion:

       I had a teacher like that who also just through the book out the window and talked about current events and gave us a really intense over view of history since pre ww2. He was super controversial and last I heard he quit and became a bus driver.

       They don't really need to say it, religion is kept out of the government schools. Remember the school prayer debate frenzy of years gone by?'

       My point isn't that we should have religious practices in government schools, it's simply pointing out that if you control the education of generations of young people, then eventually certain modes of thinking will become very scarce or nonexistent.

      <p>

       I am so incredibly grateful for my high school history teacher.  Mine always said "Those who don't learn from history, are doomed to repeat it." and "History is always written by the victors."  He would advise us not to jump to conclusions about what we hear in the media. He also made it clear that certain movies we were forced to watch like Schindler's list and Amistad are just fictional piece based on history, and in order to get the real full story we should actually research the subject.  I was disappointed when he retired shortly after I graduated because my younger siblings would not get to enjoy his teachings.  Dude bought a red jag and is enjoying his days in style though lol.

       There isn't a problem with being religious as much as there is a problem with people taking advantage of this religious belief. Something akin to quoting Revelations(?) about the current problems in Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Christians take what their pastor/priest says at face value. I can't really call myself a Christian so much anymore; however, I have nothing against people being Christian, but I do have an issue with people who will believe anything someone they think is truthful says....

       I don't know what church you went to, by my pastor just 
1) reads a story from the bible
2) creates a hypothetical anecdote
3) relates it to current events 
And 
4) tells me not to kill people and shit.

       It should be fairly obvious that religion is a conspiracy of the very sort we are always looking for. If it gives you comfort and helps you come to terms with the way things are... sounds useful.

       Its kind of like two people trying to discuss Santa Clause, and one of them believes in him and one of them does not....Some people find it hard to believe in something that they do not think is physically/scientifically possible. Not to mention the fact that we have been lied to forever by the very people that push religion on the masses.

       This is a butterfly effect of capital taking power over religion and aristocracy two centuries ago, very old lesson made to prevent former powers from ever returning. History teachers are priests despite themselves.

       I had a teacher in my pre teens who would punish us for saying "nice".  She
       <em>
        claimed

       it was because she wanted us to expand our vocabulary. Her examples tended to involve a lot of little bitch asides about the "nice" things as well though.

       It's easier to control the poor and religious. I never said it was impossible to control the atheist rich....

       Yeah, well you made out like it was a defining trait of the easily led or something.
Complete rubbish.
The west is filled to the rafters with well off agnosticish, atheistic, (haven't really thought about it because I don't careish) assholoes that suck up the MSM and vote red/blue like good sheep.
In contrast I know (online) quite a few poor religious types in third world countries that are WAY less "under control".

       Ah man. I'm definitely not trying to attack you personally here, just this is an opinion I would define as intellectually lazy, and therefore I can't help but speak against it.
Sounds like something that ultimate rabble rouser, Marx would write. 
Plenty of western imbeciles agree with that statist trash, for sure.
