    <div class="md"><p>The purpose is to learn and experience. Consciousness cannot experience without having a dimensional space/time to traverse. Everything we learn the universe learns simultaneously. It&#39;s pulled through the quantum vacuum and stored in every particle. If you want authors or lecturers of philosophy look to Terence McKenna, Alan Watts, Ram Dass, plato, pythagoras etc. If you want interesting science look to Nassim Haramein, Marko Rodin, Dan Winter. Gnosticism is spiritual knowledge. Things like this are most beneficial when approached in a hermetic fashion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its my understanding that every human being on the planet is an incarnation of our eternal souls. Every soul that does come to earth comes for a specific task to complete depending on each soul&#39;s particular spiritual evolutionary stage. So some come to help other souls reach a higher state of vibration, some come to learn something on their particular path. I think the toltecs say it best and I have found that the Toltec system of beliefs are very similar to gnostic teachings. I have spent a lot of time reading Carlos Castaneda&#39;s books on Don Juan who was a Toltec Practitioner and have found them a great introduction to Toltec teachings.</p>

<p><a href="http://kristopher-raphael.com/why_are_we_here">http://kristopher-raphael.com/why_are_we_here</a></p>

<p>Why are We Here?</p>

<p>Time for a little more Candy for the Reason. There is a purpose for coming into body. The totality of this purpose cannot be understood by reason alone however knowing, even if only intellectually in the beginning, can help give a structure to keep one on track.</p>

<p>In Toltec terminology, we are the dreamed, dreamed by the Dreamer, our life is the dream. The Dreamer is simultaneously dreaming many lifetimes, one of which is the one we presently have our awareness centered in. These lifetimes are sometimes experienced while in body as ?past,? ?future? or ?parallel? lifetimes. However, from the viewpoint of the Dreamer, which exists above the dimension of time and space, all lifetimes are happening simultaneously.</p>

<p>Why is the Dreamer dreaming so many different lifetimes?</p>

<p>The reason lies in a unique aspect of physicality. In physicality, time and space exists. There is a past, present and future. Things bump into each other in space. There is no bumping on the level of the Dreamer. There is only blending. Most importantly as far as humans are concerned, in this dimension it is possible to experience INDIVIDUALITY.</p>

<p>On the plane of the Dreamer, individuality does not exist. The Dreamer exists as a collective ? not quite at the state of oneness, but close. The Dreamer is like a bucket of paint. In the bucket there are swirls of different colors. You can see the different colors, however no matter how hard you try, you cannot separate them.</p>

<p>The swirls of colors are different issues that humanity as a collective needs to work out. Sometimes these colors are called karma. In baby metaphysics karma is thought to ?belong? to a person due to cause and effect of their past lives and so on. As with many beliefs, this is only partially true. A higher truth is that karma is collective. Karma exists in the vat of humanity. When we incarnate we pass through this vat (in accordance to the Intent of the Dreamer) and take on some color. This color manifests as life issues that we are meant to work out while in body.</p>

<p>On the level of the Dreamer, the colors cannot be separated. Because it is much easier to refine a color when it is separated from the whole, the Dreamer dreams a lifetime into physicality. When the earth-life-system was originally set up, individuality was created. Without individuality, it would be impossible to separate a ?color? (life issue) to refine.</p>

<p>It is important to realize that individuality is not the same as separateness. Separateness is what happens when the ego (called the human form by Toltecs), takes individuality and perverts it.</p>

<p>You have two little fingers, for example. The fingers are individual. If you look at them closely you will see that they look different ? different skin features, difference in coloring, size and so on.</p>

<p>They are individual, however are they separate? Obviously not. They are connected through your body (akin to the Dreamer in our metaphor). If they were separate we could cut off a finger, and it would not affect the other finger. However, because they are individual and not separate we cannot cut off one finger without affecting the whole body.</p>

<p>What you do in this lifetime simultaneously effects all of your lifetimes, past, present and future. Moreover, what you do affects all of humanity as we are all interconnected, individuals, but not separate.</p>

<p>The importance of individuality is important to understand. Too many people who are on a ?spiritual? path are trying to avoid their individuality. They are trying to run back to ?oneness,? which is rather silly as it defeats the purpose for coming into body in the first place.</p>

<p>With meditation and other spiritual practices, oneness can be readily experienced. It is beneficial to experience and recall our source while body. However, experiencing oneness and trying to run away to oneness are two different things. Running away to oneness is no more than an avoidance of the work we came here to do. When we use ?spirituality? to escape from our life, we defeat the very purpose for coming into body, we run counter to the Intent of the Nagual, and can end up wasting the gift of life.</p>

<p>A significant part (not the entire part, but an essential part) of our purpose for coming into body is to refine our piece of the pie, our karma. We experience our karma individually. It feels like it is ours because it is supposed to. If it felt like it belonged to all of humanity, we would be less motivated to heal and refine it.</p>

<p>Our ?karma? is experienced as life issues when we come into body. Life issues are an energy we bring into body. It is the energy that attracts our parents, family and resultant wounding. Life issues lie deeper than our wounding, which is why we must heal to a significant degree before we are able to bring our life issues into awareness.</p>

<p>Becoming aware of our life issues is a big step, and an essential step in spiritual growth and evolution. Most people do not make it to having enough awareness to know their life issues. They haven?t done enough cleaning, clearing and healing of the human tonal to get to their life issues. With out a substantial degree of healing our wounding, our perception is too clouded to see our life issues.</p>

<p>Too much intellectual understanding without the actual ?doing? of the work makes it impossible to progress on a spiritual path. You do not take your mental body with you when you drop the body. You do take the evolution your ?being? makes, and this evolution can only happen through the refining of our life-issues.</p>

<p>We have so much help while we are in body. When we clean, clear, heal and strengthen our human tonal, and raise the frequency of our platform, the wonders of this place in creation open to us. Higher aspects of Self, the Dreamer and unseen friends (who do not exist in body) are there, guiding and co-creating our lives through us. Every step we take in life is imbued with purpose aligned with the Intent of the Nagual that flows through our Dreamer, into our Nagual aspects of self and into our tonal aspects.</p>

<p>I often tell people that we are now in a new paradigm in spirituality. It is no longer sufficient to run ?up? to Spirit. Now we must bring what we are given when ?up? back down and through our human tonal so that Spirit may be manifest in our lives and physicality. This can only happen when we have done enough healing to get to our life issues, and it can only happen when we refine our life issues so as to grow and evolve our level of being, and it can only happen when we live our life in full alignment to the Intent of the Nagual. This state of living is called the Mastery of Intent by the Toltecs. It is a wondrous place to live from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out r/occult. The people there would love to help you out on your quest.</p>

<p>Also, you should check out hermetica. Com or sacred texts. Com. </p>

<p>Those two sites have a lot of content. </p>

<p>Gnosticism dates to the second century bc, so there is a lot of content about this ancient mystery tradition. 
Granted, at the time gnosticism was starting out most of their texts were not written down, and those that were burned out in Alexandera, which is a pity. </p>

<p>The point is to realize that you are everything that is and is not. THE ALL, as the Hermeticism calls the source of all creation. 
Everyone will learn the highest axiom &quot;All is self&quot;  in their own way, on their own terms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally like the classical hermetic texts. 
The Corpus Hermetica and The Corpus Hermetium are among my favorite, as well as The Divine Poemandre. 
The classic texts are so vague and mysterious it allows you to emerge and immerse yourself into their mysteries. 
However, a lot of the ancient texts of such knowledge ramble on into obscurity. 
There are quite a few &quot;modern&quot; hermetic books I enjoy, such as the ones you listed. 
The kybalion gives great detail in what hermeticism speaks about. It is clear and concise and gets straight to the point. I believe it to be one of the best books on hermeticism of our modern age. 
Franz Bardons initiation into Hermetics is a great read too. </p>

<p>I downloaded a lot of occult books from the piratebay. One specific torrent covers a lot of occult studies, from evocation to remote viewing, Nordic shamanism to Masturbation. </p>

<p>You have done yourself a great deep by studying the sacred science and art that is Hermeticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want to start by reading the following book, link at the end. Gnosticism is the search for knowledge, truth. The world that we exist in was made
By the demiurge (God) the demiurge came from the Pistis Sophia which in turn is an existence from the pleroma (the light the first existence etc) that touched the void (it gets messy and my memory is not complete, the book will explain). Now the demiurge creates because It has a sense of the pleroma but cannot be part of it. So in the end man was made and man has been given a divine spark in itself and that spark will eventually go back to the pleroma. The demiurge is evil and gives suffering. There are three types of humans, ones who have the truth inside them which they must share, ones who have the ability to listen to this truth and understand and ones who cannot hear or see this truth at all. It also deals a lot with duality of existence that is a major theme. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve only just dipped in but this guy has spent a long time deciphering the inaccessible translations of the &#39;myths&#39;, and making them much easier to read. mindblowing stuff with some really interesting unificatory physics and solar-system history involved. </p>
