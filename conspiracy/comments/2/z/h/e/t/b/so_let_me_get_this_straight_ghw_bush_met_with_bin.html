       Can you elaborate because it would have to be multiple sources.  With one source being his son and the other his own wife in her memoirs.  So that is 2 of three.

       Hinckley was a well known backer of Bush's political career in texas, so that relationship is known and sourced in several places.  There is no ambiguity about these connections.

       lots of famous Americans (Ford, Disney) supported/funded the nazi's. I think that maybe at the time communism was much more of a threat to the westerns way of life, so once the national-socialist party took control of Germany everyone jumped aboard to support them considering how well communism worked out for the Russians under the Bolsheviks.

       William Cooper states it in his JFK documentary. Mind you he also said the driver shot Kennedy, so do with it what you will.

       Oh.

      <p>
       I believe the driver was involved, in some respect, but I don't think he was a shooter. I've seen the videos suggesting he was but none of it has convinced me so far. I think he was culpable of slowing down to make sure the kill shot was as easy as possible for the snipers, and checking over his shoulder to make sure it had happened, but I don't buy into him being a trigger man himself

       Considering he did the exact opposite of what the protocol is, I suspect some involvement. The lone shooter and the magic bullet garbage is laughable.  Right up there with the 911 commission and their garbage. The Bush regime has made a mockery of us all. Dollars for doughnuts this Jeb clown gets in next.

       Nobody is bothered because of  this :-
      </p>
      <p>
       The six grand illusions that keep us enslaved to the Matrix
      </p>
      <p>
       The Illusion of Law, Order and Authority - The social order is not what it seems, for it is entirely predicated on conformity, obedience and acquiescence which are enforced by fear of violence. The pomp and trappings of authority are merely a concealment of the truth that the current world order is predicated on control, not consent.
      </p>
      <pre><code>The Illusion of Prosperity and Happiness - Adorning oneself in expensive clothes and trinkets ... became a substitute for genuine prosperity. [T]he illusion of prosperity is critical to our economy because its foundation is built on consumption, fraud, credit and debt. True prosperity is a vibrant environment and an abundance of health, happiness, love, and relationships.

The Illusion of Choice and Freedom - Just look no further than the phony institution of modern democracy to find a shining example of false choices appearing real. A powerful oppressor because it fools us into accepting chains and short leashes as though they were the hallmarks of liberty.

The Illusion of Truth - In order to maintain order, the powers that be depend on our acquiescence to their version of the truth. While independent thinkers and journalists continually blow holes in the official versions of reality, the illusion of truth is so very powerful that it takes a serious personal upheaval to shun the cognitive dissonance needed to function in a society that openly chases false realities.

The Illusion of Time - They say that time is money, but this is a lie. Time is your life. Your life is an ever-evolving manifestation of the now. The big deception here is the reinforcement of the idea that the present moment is of little to no value. Once completely focused on what is to come rather than what is, we are easy prey to advertisers and fear-pimps who muddy our vision of the future with every possible worry and concern imaginable.

The Illusion of separateness - The tactic of divide and conquer is standard operating procedure for authoritarians and invading armies. As individuals we are in competition with everyone and everything around us, including our neighbours and even mother nature. Us vs. them to the extreme. This flatly denies the truth that life on this planet is infinitely inter-connected.

       The Roosevelt that put his desires for an american empire above the lives of countless latin americans and worked to take away power from labor unions or the roosevelt that took the american presidency to unprecedented levels of secrecy and worked to take away democracy through secret orders going around the senate or people and propaganda.

       Down the rabbit hole I go. I googled for a few minutes, but is there
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       other article or book independent of that site that talks about this theory?

       I came to say the same thing...  Probably several hundred thousand are highly interested in GHWB, and most are in conspiracy already, where they can go to their hearts content, arguing back and forth about exactly what the finer points are -- and meanwhile, billions of people are clueless, and just want to know when Kim and Kanye are on next.  It's a crock -- unless we RAISE IT much higher.  I'm equally guilty too -- I have no defense I'm afraid.  What CAN we do?

       I think it's mostly natural. We as a species are genetically identical to the first people who were hunter gatherers in Africa. They had 3 goals back then: food, shelter, and family. It's the same base nature now, but it's constantly used against us. Companies use it to get us to buy stuff, governments use it to get us to give them power.

       This group of people operate with no compassion and no regard for humanity.  Their objective is very simple:  Do whatever it takes to expand and grow the US empire's power in the name of "national security".

       You don't get to vote on it or have a say in it.  You can influence unimportant matters all you want, but your right to determine your own destiny has been stolen from you in the name of "national security".

       You don't think the "American empire" was ever "ours", do you?  People use legal fictions like corporations and governments to hide their personal empires from scrutiny while avoiding responsibility for their immoral behavior.  Calling yourself a "government official" is just a small language difference from someone on the "king's court" and, in reality, their duties would serve the same purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of like when they decided to rename "secretaries" as "administrative assistants".  The only thing that changed was the name.

       Well... isn't that the beauty of "national security"?  You get to rig elections!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think that if these people will not allow citizens in countries like Venezuela, Guatemala, Ukraine, and Cuba the right to self-determination that they would allow that in their home country?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is too much of a blow to their power to lose control of countries that are not their "home base", then what do you really think the odds are that they would leave their "home base" to chance?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a joke and is simply illogical to think they would.  You can tell your mom she can rest assured that the president has been selected to preserve the status quo.

       You're wrong.  This has been discussed.  The other George Bush has been identified and was a simple file clerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hoover was not going to take the time to brief a file clerk about the assassination of the president.  It's absurd to suggest otherwise.

       Yes I know he was a copy boy.  I was alluding to the absurdity of the argument that was put forth by Camp Bush that he had met with Hoover instead of H.W.  The latter was a ref to the Star Wars Jedi mind trick.

       That and reading the operations northwooods document. Once you see them discussing downing airplanes full of americans to make it look like cuba did it so they can invade you realize there is nothing these people wont do. Nothing menas shooting the presidentt jfk - who told them to stop.

       Don't mischaracterize this by accident.  They don't "run everything".  That would be impossible.  They have formed alliances all over the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Need to produce some passports for fake "terrorists"?  Just use your Saudi contacts that live in a relatively closed society on the other side of the world.  You did, after all, funnel weapons and training to them to create the security apparatus for your friends in exchange for oil and cooperation.  Heck!  They even jokingly called the head of Saudi intelligence "Bandar Bush."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bush family filled the void that Allen Dulles left.  He and Prescott were very close.  Dulles had no children, so he could have a progeny in GHW and, in return, GHW would use his new power and knowledge to favor his father's (and his friends) business interests.

       Honestly, I wouldn't consider those photos noteworthy.  They are too vague and inconclusive to serve any purpose other than to give cannon fodder to those who would use this against you.

       Agreed. Not to sound like a parrot of myself or a shill for Baker, but Family of Secrets connects the dots better than any other source I've found on the Bush dynasty. A must read for anybody interested in our shadow government and the deep ties from Prescott to GWB...and he delves DEEPLY into GHWB's activities around that faitful day in Texas.

       Go fuck yourself.  I explained why it can act as an unnecessary distraction and may actually serve to cast doubt, in and of itself.  You haven't even "proven yourself right" in the first place, so don't try to send me on a task like you have some sort of power over me.

       He also just So happened to have called the fbi head hoover to declare he thought a friend of his might have shot kennedy. Just out of the blue. This guy with no connections supposedly calls to make an alibi while his photo has been taken indallas at the entranc eto the building where the president was shot. All coincindence of course.

       I agree that it might be him.  My only point is that if you can't verify it 100%, then people will use that to discredit all of the other evidence.  That other evidence can stand on its own and doesn't require support from the photos.  take care.

       However i dont know what evidence is more convincing than a photo of a guy stnading there.

       Today all evidence can be faked.

       I would say he should face the death penalty, but only if we can bring him back to kill him again, and again, and again.  But until then, life behind bars would be great.  As long as he was cell mates with some of the ones from the countrys he fucked over that has a thing for old white dudes.  Unless he like it.  Then we could always put him in a womens prison.

       Out of sight out of mind.  I hope some one doesnt get crushed from the avalanche of bones when we open this sick fucks closet.  Hopefully it is done before he dies so he knows the world sees him for what he is.  A piece of shit criminal that has the blood of JFK on his hands and what amounts to be a crime against humanity for that alone.  He does not deserve to have one school named after him, one building, or street.  If anything he should be the new name for tiolet paper so we think of him while wiping the shit off our asses.  But then again, I dont want to give shit that bad of name.

       What does him being "black sheeped" have fuck all to do with anything?  Furthermore, you can't actually provide proof that the claim is meaningful or actually true in any way.

Just because someone is a member of a family and he did something doesn't mean the whole family is at fault now does it? I don't have a horse in this race. Just pointed something out.

       Oh... we know.. you are just "an honest arbiter for the truth!"  Everyone feel sorry for him because he is just "an honest guy asking questions"!  /victimcard

       Go through my post history and find the last time I said the word "strawman".... I fucking dare you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's convenient how your version of "the truth" is always in sync with every government narrative.  Seriously... fuck off... people are tiring of being purposely deceived.  Maybe you should do something productive with your life.

       Tell me... what the fuck did you add to the conversation?  Nothing.  All you ever do is show up and try to confuse people with logical fallacies and strawmen.

       That may work on some, but people are becoming more and more aware of dickholes like you.  I have seen your name a lot and have never seen you contribute anything of substance.  You aren't honest about why you are here.  You never stray from the official position unless it is an issue of no consequence.

       Nobody wants you here.  I'm done playing games with retarded dickheads like you.

       I just said his family is big. Hitlers "family" fought for the allies against the Nazi's. Do you see how that shit works little boy? Just because SOMEONE in the family did something doesn't mean "the family" is evil. Please refute my point sir.

       The bin laden family funded the japanese architect who buitl the world trade towers . He had just helped rebuild mecca.
      </p>
      <p>
       The towers had arabic arches at the bottom and the plaza was meant to reseemble mecca with two minaretts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its likely bin laden had precise building plans for the world rade center towers.
