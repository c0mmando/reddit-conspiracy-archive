    <div class="md"><p>All you have to do is read the conclusions of the WTC 7 NIST report. Several seconds of free fall; first building of its kind to collapse from office fires, and so on. Oh, and of course the models that prove the single-column initiated collapse event have not been released to the public. But why wouldn&#39;t we just take their word for it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt the fact that wtc7 reached free fall speed during its collapse is the most damning evidence.  It means there was no resistance given whatsoever by any of the support columns at the exact same time.  This does not happen in a natural collapse caused by fires on a few floors on one side if the building.  I would even say it is impossible for a steel framed skyscraper. </p>

<p>Of course NIST has their theory about how Building 7 collapsed but they refuse to release the model data so that it can be peer reviewed because &quot;safety&quot;.  Really they refuse to release it because it is impossible and if they did release it we would see that it is bullshit immediately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s kind of shocking that they were able to get away with that, isn&#39;t it? I would have expected people to throw a fit after they claimed that an office fire brought down a brick and steel building (for the first time in history) but refused to release the models. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a statement made by the NIST director in 2009:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to Section 7(d) of the National Construction Safety Team Act, I hereby find that <strong>the disclosure of the information described below</strong>, received by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (&quot;NIST&quot;), in connection with its investigation of the technical causes of the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers and World Trade Center Building 7 on September 11,2001, <strong>might jeopardize public safety.</strong> Therefore, NIST shall not release the following information:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>All input and results files of the ANSYS 16-story collapse initiation model with detailed connection models that were used to analyze the structural response to thermal loads, break element source code, ANSYS script files for the break elements, custom executable ANSYS file, and all Excel spreadsheets and other supporting calculations used to develop floor connection failure modes and capacities.</p></li>
<li><p>All input files with connection material properties and all results files of the LS-DYNA 47-story global collapse model that were used to simulate sequential structural failures leading to collapse, and all Excel spreadsheets and other supporting calculations used to develop floor connection failure modes and capacities.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Fucking outrageous, is it not? Of course he&#39;s right that releasing those files would endanger public safety; there would be riots on the streets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fundamentally, you will end up at the collapse of building 7.  In order for something to be considered factual based on the scientific method, an experiment must be repeatable.</p>

<p>They made the data to verify their models classified on the grounds of &quot;national security&quot;.  That makes their claim unprovable and also <strong>unproven</strong>.  There is no way around this fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think training exercises is one of the best arguments. It takes a real leap in logic to assume that it was simply coincidence that the government would perform exercises that included planes hypothetically flying into buildings....on a day when planes actually flew into multiple buildings. </p>

<p>Holding a training exercise is the best way to provide cover for something like this, as it strains the government&#39;s resources for responding (at least for those in the government who weren&#39;t in the know and thought it was an outside attack), allows for fewer events and resources to be manipulated to pull it off as things are already in place for attack mode, and blurs the line between &quot;real&quot; and &quot;fake&quot; within the government.</p>

<p>There is also the &quot;Angel is next&quot; message that was sent to Air Force One after the attacks while Bush was on it, along with a litany of other secret military codewords uttered over the radio which suggested an inside threat. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz_ZBWUWLwg">Here&#39;s a great video</a> from Webster Tarpley that explains how it all makes a case that 9/11 was a military coup against Bush, and if he didn&#39;t go along with the &quot;bin laden middle east terrorism wars wars wars&quot; explanation they would take Air Force One out. Bush ran on a policy of non-interventionism, and though I don&#39;t think he was completely genuine to that end, he was basically forced by elements within the government to comply or else he would be taken out.</p>

<p>This is not true.  The best that I can tell is that Jimmy Carter was not part of the cabal and, to back it up with a fact, he fired GHW Bush from the CIA director position as one of his first actions in office.</p>

<p>He did face repercussions from this.  The Bush family used their Saudi connections (remember &quot;Bandar Bush&quot;) to drive the gas prices up (never ignore linking the Bushes to the Saudis).  This was part one of making Jimmy Carter look bad.</p>

<p>Part two was how he negotiated with the Iranians to ensure that the hostage crisis would not be resolved until he and reagan secured the presidency.  As a two stage attack, these artificial crises made Carter appear incompetent in both domestic and foreign policies along with making him appear to be a weak leader in the eyes of the international community.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called an &quot;October Surprise&quot;.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Surprise_conspiracy_theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Surprise_conspiracy_theory</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO you want to focus more on the <em>why</em> question of why the 9/11 operation was carried out.  Most people don&#39;t understand physics.  They grasp concepts like corruption, money laundering, war, etc.  Even when the physics makes sense a lot of people still ask WHY? would anyone do that anyway.  It&#39;s hard for them to accept what their eyes show them until they can process the geopolitics behind it.</p>

You have no way of knowing who these people are, or if they are credible. I think the area around the Pentagon was cleared of any bystanders, they could easily throw some debris around. </p>

<p>If you need to invent excuses for why they are hiding the videos then there is something fishy going on. I think it is very dangerous when the public&#39;s response to government cover-ups is &quot;I&#39;m sure they have a good reason&quot;; because they usually don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Even if the plane went in sideways, there would be a bigger hole. Unless you can delude yourself into believing that the Pentagon is stronger than a skyscraper, and the wings, after bouncing off of the side of the building then got sucked in behind the plane; it just doesn&#39;t make sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really believe a missile hit the Pentagon you should build your case with facts and know what you&#39;re talking about. You haven&#39;t said anything to me yet that has even made me a little curious. If you really want to defend your belief that a missile hit the Pentagon you should be dumping information on me that can be verified. </p>

<p>My mistake about the witnesses, there were around 130 reported eyewitnesses, and a few more hundred who were close to the pentagon (the pentagon is literally surrounded by highways) not one person reported seeing anything other than a plane hit the pentagon. </p>

<p>I never said they had a good excuse to hide the videos, but the government hiding the videos doesn&#39;t mean that a missile hit the pentagon. </p>

<p>If explosives were used, the wings could have been blown up with the rest of the plane being blown up. Which would also explain why such a small amount of debris was found.  Also I would love to hear you explain how hundreds of people were kept from seeing some guys scatter plane debris around the lawn without any of the witnesses seeing. Because once again the pentagon is surrounded by highways.</p>

<p>And to the hole comment, here you GO</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why wasn&#39;t the hole as wide as a 757&#39;s 124-ft.-10-in. wingspan? A crashing jet doesn&#39;t punch a cartoon-like outline of itself into a reinforced concrete building, says ASCE team member Mete Sozen, a professor of structural engineering at Purdue University. In this case, one wing hit the ground; the other was sheared off by the force of the impact with the Pentagon&#39;s load-bearing columns, explains Sozen, who specializes in the behavior of concrete buildings. What was left of the plane flowed into the structure in a state closer to a liquid than a solid mass. &quot;If you expected the entire wing to cut into the building,&quot; Sozen tells PM, &quot;it didn&#39;t happen.&quot;</p>

<p>The tidy hole in Ring C was 12 ft. wide—not 16 ft. ASCE concludes it was made by the jet&#39;s landing gear, not by the fuselage.</p>

<p>Associated Press item dated May 30, 2002.</p>

<p>&quot;The morning of Sept. 11, Sen. Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss were
doing what the two intelligence committee chairmen frequently do -
having breakfast together at the Capitol. With them was then-Pakistani
intelligence chief [Mahmud Ahmad]. [General Ahmad&#39;s] task was to
persuade Afghanistan&#39;s Taliban leaders to hand over terror suspect
Osama bin Laden. As the three men talked over the knotty problem, an
aide handed Goss a note saying an airplane had hit the World Trade
Center. A few moments later the Capitol would be evacuated, and the
following month [General Ahmad] was fired.&quot; </p>

<p>However, the Times also revealed that on September 11 -- while the attacks were in progress -- the two current Co-Chairmen of the Joint-Intelligence Committee investigating the 9/11 attacks, Senator Bob Graham (D-FL) and Representative Porter Goss (R-FL), met for breakfast with the ISI Chief who had ordered $100,000 wired from Pakistan to terrorist leader Mohammed Atta in the days immediately preceeding the attacks.</p>

<p>According to the FBI, Indian Intelligence and several press reports, the ISI Head was instrumental in providing financial support to the 9/11 terrorists. General Mahmoud Ahmad had allegedly ordered the transfer of $100.000 to the presumed 9/11 ring-leader Mohamed Atta. </p>

<p>How fitting that this is the same House Intelligence chairman Porter Goss who was having breakfast in D.C. on 9/11 with Pakistan&#39;s security chief, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Ahmad—who was later revealed to be hijacker Mohammed Atta&#39;s bagman. </p>

<p>A Times of India (10-12-2001) story by Manoj Joshi revealed that Pakistani ISA Director-General Lt. General Mahmud Ahmad sought retirement after the U.S. attacks -- confirmed by top sources in India, because of evidence produced by India showing his links to Mohammed Atta, the terrorist hijacking leader.</p>

<p>The Times said that &quot;U.S. authorities sought his [Ahmad&#39;s] removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 was wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh on the instructions of ISI Lt. General Ahmad.&quot; Senior [U.S.] government sources &quot;have confirmed that India contributed significantly to establishing the link between the money transfer and the role played by the dismissed ISI chief.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Presidential candidate Senator Joe Biden admitted meeting with the chief financier of the 9/11 hijackers in the days after September 11 after being confronted by We Are Change founder Luke Rudkowski in the press room following Sunday&#39;s Democratic debate in New Hampshire.</p>

<p>According to the FBI and as confirmed by various news reports at the time, Pakistani ISI General Mahmoud Ahmad instructed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the alleged assassin of Daniel Pearl, to wire $100,000 to alleged lead hijacker Mohammed Atta in the summer of 2001.</p>

<p>Arriving exactly one week before 9/11, the general met with Pentagon, White House National Security Council and CIA officials, including George Tenet and Marc Grossman, then U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs.</p>

<p>On the very morning of 9/11, Ahmad was at a breakfast meeting on Capitol Hill hosted by Senator Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss, the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence committees.</p>

<p>Two days after the attack on the twin towers and the Pentagon, on September 13th, Senator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with the ISI chief.</p>

<p>No adequate explanation has been forthcoming as to why top government and intelligence officials were meeting with the money man behind the alleged hijackers before and after 9/11.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Democratic debate had finished on Sunday, Prison Planet reporter Rudkowski was able to get access to the CNN spin room and confront presidential candidate Biden about his 9/11 meeting with the Pakistani General.</p>

<p>We asked him the question - what was he doing with the head of the Pakistani ISI General Mahmoud Ahmad, said Rudkowski, he told me - he admitted that he met with him - he met with the head of the Pakistani ISI.</p>

<p>He said I told them not to do it, I told them not to wire the money - I told them to stop supporting the Taliban, which shows he had foreknowledge of them supporting him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told him - sir, he funded the hijackers, you did business with him, you let him go - he&#39;s free,&quot; said Rudkowski, to which Biden responded, &quot;Get a life kid,&quot; after which Rudkowski was pushed away by Biden&#39;s security staff.</p>

<p>The part that never made sense to me is we have a zillion videos/witnesses of planes crashing into the WTC towers.  But you think this did not occur, or in addition there were explosives planted? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to troll, I&#39;m genuinely curious.  I could perhaps see the government having for knowledge of the event and ignoring it, to further their own purposes.  But I don&#39;t get why lace a building with explosives and then crash a plane into it? It seems redundant and highly risky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The plane in my assessment was real enough but it may have been a mislabeled military aircraft. The reason for planted explosives are twofold.  The buildings were to be brought down by 2008 by order of the EPA because of flaws in their construction.  However  a traditional demolition would have cost billions  and far more than the value of the property. First there would be the years of legal wrangling,  then the fact that  they would have to begin by constructing two sets of scaffolding that were one acre square and 110 stories tall. The lawsuits would be completely uncontainable due to deaths among workers and because of asbestos  that was installed in the ceilings of some 40 floors in each building  which would be inevitably released into New York&#39;s air. .
<a href="http://imgur.com/egn70NF">http://imgur.com/egn70NF</a></p>

<p>Secondly there was an extremely embarrassing mistake in the construction of the towers in which it became inevitable that the aluminum fascia of the building would eventually fall off because of a process called Galvanic Corrosion.  </p>

<p>Therefore the buildings had to have an accident.</p>

<p>Galvanic corrosion is caused when two dis similar metals are joined together in the presence of an electrolyte (consisting , in this case of salt air depositing salt one the buildings combined with rain water). The combination of these factors caused a  charge  of approximately. 1 .5 volts to  continuously flow between the two metals (aluminum and steel)  which cause the metals to be slowly eaten away.  Thus this anomaly that appeared after the collapses showing that the welds and bolts had wasted away near  ground level. note also the lack of layering of the debris which would necessarily be caused if the collapses were caused by gravity and the presence of extreme amounts of shrapnel which would be caused by explosives.</p>

<p>The local building codes  in New York would have insisted that the two metals be separated with spacers, millions of spacers, and apparently those spacers were never applied so it was known that a worldwide embarrassment would grow out of that omission if word got out . The damage to the  reputation of  American engineering and construction  would make us a laughing stock.</p>

<p>Here is the deposition of a witness to that problem whom I had contact with for over a year.</p>

<p>So, the answer to your question about the need for explosives planted within the buildings is to make damn sure the blighted real estate was completely demolished by a profitable &#39;accident&#39; rather than have the extreme expense of a traditional demolition.</p>

<p>There are 2 calls that contradict the offical version of events; the before mentioned <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">Todd Beamer call and Jeremy Glick&#39;s.</a></p>

<p>Todd Beamer:</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Flight 93 hijack occurred at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">9:28</a></p>

<p>&amp;gt;Todd Beamer&#39;s call describes the hijack about to happen at <a href="http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/2001-09-11-FBI-FD302-lisa-jefferson.pdf">9:43</a></p>

<p>&amp;gt;Flight 93 crashed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Crash">10:03</a></p>

<p>&amp;gt;Todd Beamer&#39;s call made with an airphone last for <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">3925 seconds.</a> It last 45 minutes <em>after</em> the plane had already crashed.</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Lisa Jefferson also confirms that the call was not lost: <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Inspiration/2006/06/I-Promised-I-Wouldnt-Hang-Up.aspx?p=2">&quot;We didn’t lose a connection because there’s a different sound that you use. It’s a squealing sound when you lose a connection. I never lost connection, but it just went silent.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Jeremy Glick:</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Call starts at 9:37</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Flight 93 crashes at 10:03</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Call lasts for 7565 seconds, placing the end of the call at 11:41. It last for 1 hour and ~38 minutes <em>after</em> the plane had already crashed.</p>

<p>These calls were made from the airplane&#39;s airphone destined to two different interfaces: One was to the GTE&#39;s assistant landline telephone, the other was to a cellphone.</p>

<p>These calls could not have remained connected by a system mistake because airphones charge per time, the system was built to only count the time the client is connected in order to avoid overcharging him by allowing calls to &quot;stay connected&quot; when they were not. The fact that they also disconnected at different times rules out any possible system fault which, if possible, would at best disconnect both calls at the same time since they would have &quot;disconnected&quot; at the same time, the time of the crash.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/ACARS-CONFIRMED-911-AIRCRAFT-AIRBORNE-LONG-AFTER-CRASH.html">ACARS data also corroborates the above,</a> seen that the only possible explanation for the calls to remain connected after the airplane crashed is that the airplane from where the calls came from never crashed in the first place.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE TOWERS&#39; COLLAPSES</strong></p>

<p><strong>SOUTH TOWER</strong></p>

<p>The section above the airplane impact zone tilted and then fell vertically, violating Newton&#39;s First Law of Motion in which a body in motion (rotation in this case) tends to stay in motion unless acted on by an outside force. In this case <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcQOODryBDw">this was the expected movement of the top</a> if it was simply collapsing.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the top section tilted and was only ~30%(33floors) of the building it was still capable of destroying the remaining ~69%(76 floors) completely, directly violating Newton&#39;s third law.</p>

<p><strong>NORTH TOWER</strong></p>

<p>A problem with this collapse is that despite the fact that the top section fell vertically and almost symmetrically, it can be clearly identified a concentrated destruction almost as fast as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYW89xEYg0&amp;amp;amp;t=26">debris fall occurring on the right face of the building.</a></p>

<p>Sharing the exact same result as the South Tower, the North tower also violates Newton&#39;s third law by an even larger margin. The top section was only 15.45%(17 floors) destroying the intact <del>93%</del> 83% (92 floors).</p>

<p>According to NIST, WTC1 fell only 28% longer than pure free-fall:</p>

<p>&amp;gt;&quot;The upper section of the building then collapsed onto the floors below, within <strong>12s</strong>, the collapse of WTC 1 had left nothing but rubble.&quot;</p>

<p>If it was free fall it would have been 9.32s without air resistance, meaning that <em>-according to NIST-</em> all floors provided a resistance that add up to 2.77s (12s - 9.32s).</p>

<p>Below the collapse area there were 95 floors.</p>

<p>2.77s / 95 floors = each floor being destroyed in <strong>0.029s</strong></p>

<p>29/<strong>1000ths</strong> of a second.</p>

<p>According to NIST, each floor -composed by concrete and steel- was being destroyed as fast as the impact between a stick and a cue ball.</p>

<p>Despite the top being only ~<strong>16%</strong> of the building (weaker and lighter), the result was still a perfect vertical gravity assisted downfall destruction of the remaining <del>93%</del> 83% perfectly intact structure (<em>stronger as well</em>) defying yet again another law of physics -Newton&#39;s third law- in which a smaller and weaker body cannot destroy a bigger and stronger body.</p>

<p>For example: for every floor of the <del>93%</del> 83% destroyed another floor of the 16% has to be destroyed. If Newton&#39;s third law had been respected, the building would be standing with ~75 floors, not 0.

<p><strong>TOWER SEVEN</strong></p>

<p>Building 7 was hit by the debris <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wvNAAty.jpg">from one of the collapses</a> which caused fires and facade damage, one easily identified <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1E4Wrej.png">top to bottom gash.</a></p>

<p>Despite the presence of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/REuXNXp.jpg">large quantities of smoke,</a> there was never discovered any floor completely engulfed by fire, only partial fires and only on a few floors. The presence of<a href="http://i.imgur.com/LEeo3dH.jpg"> soot in the windows</a> are the indicator of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OZ16WEX.jpg">fires that were already extinct.</a></p>

<p>The only fires that last long enough and could be responsible for the building to collapse were only on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H25G67L.jpg">3 floors</a> and they were only partial small fires.</p>

<p>For a better comparison on the dimensions of WTC7&#39;s small office fires, here you have an example of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RckrL1M.jpg">normal office fires</a> (or just plain office fires) and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KeOLtCQ.jpg">extreme office fires</a> (or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8t40Tdw.jpg">infernos</a>).</p>

<p>By the time that the collapse initiated <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news-section/41-articles/761-fraud-exposed-in-nist-wtc-7-reports-part-1.html">there were no more fires near the vicinity of the section that was appointed as the collapse failure initiation.</a> This means that the building started the collapse for a reason other than fire.</p>

<p>Despite public belief, the building did in fact collapse with sudden onset of free-fall (<em>18 visible stories in 3.9s</em>), there were no stages. A better explanation is provided below.</p>

<p>There was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">a loud explosion</a> that occurred right before the penthouse collapse. That explosion cannot possibly be from any structure &quot;snapping&quot; or &quot;failing&quot; because you would hear in that same video the rest of the building collapse as well, which you do not. If you cannot hear the entire building collapse then that explosion couldn&#39;t possibly be from a column failing.</p>

<p>In contrast with the WTC7 building, here you can see the other buildings that were hit with exponentially bigger forces (hit directly by the towers&#39; debris), some which under larger fires and did not globally collapse:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IG6zNy9.png">WTC3</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ajG1Eln.jpg">WTC4</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/W7wPbQJ.jpg">WTC5</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pN4Humj.jpg">WTC6</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vSKVhSB.jpg">Deutsche bank building</a></p>

<p>And here are buildings that suffered extreme office fires and did not turn into a pile of ruble:</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)</a>, literally gravitational acceleration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">(the official reports even admit this)</a> which is impossible in a steel framed building, there is nothing in science or engineering that would explain how every single supporting column would disappear within mere fractions of a second, the only explanation, within the realms of science, is explosives of some description, taking out the columns in a timed sequence.</p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>Why are they hiding this data? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles, if we have to go on what they have released so far, <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/NIST-collapse-model-building-7.jpg">a collapse model that bores no resemblance to the observed collapse</a> </p>

<p>Thus their findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data and so if anyone outside of NIST believes what they say, they believe it on pure faith. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QyTbq5P">Page 3 and the architect&#39;s appeal over the remaining 3370 files</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">Remember also that the BBC even reported that the building had collapsed 20minutes before it had</a>, remarkable.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YmynBCH.jpg">The tilting of the south tower,</a> just before collapse.</p>

<p>According to Sir Isaac Newton’s law of the conservation of momentum, it should have kept tipping over, but it didn&#39;t, it fell through the path of greatest resistance. The top was tilting at approximately 20 degrees or so, how could it be exerting a uniform, symmetrical pressure on the floors below? it didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nhsn9w9Vg">Watch a compilation of the collapse</a> what you are observing is approximately 30 upper floors begin to rotate as a block, to the south and east.They begin to topple over, not fall straight down.The torque due to gravity on this block is enormous, as is its angular momentum. But then  this block turned mostly to powder in mid-air! How can we understand this strange behavior, without explosives?</p>

<p>[Video evidence also shows that the lower sections of the Towers do not even begin to start collapsing until the upper sections are completely destroyed]([Imgur](<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg%5C)">http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg\)</a>) This is an impossibility if we are to believe the official reports </p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST&#39;s global collapse theory, in regards the complete collapse of two 110 story skyscrapers violates Newton&#39;s laws of motion.</p>

<p>It is scientifically impossible and completely illogical that these two buildings, which had an upper block exerting a force of only 36% of its static weight, could crush the larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building
to the ground, when the building, at any level, was designed to support several times the weight above
it,  while it maintains its downward acceleration. </p>

<p>The persistent acceleration of the top section of the building is
direct evidence that some other source of energy was used to remove the structure below it, </p>

<p>Videos show that the section of the building above the plane impact point was the first section to disintegrate</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Pentagon attack does appear of some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">Red herring</a> In researching this particular topic, one can come to several conclusions, but ponder..</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is the alleged pilot of this plane, not on the flight manifest and how did he avoid all CCTV at the airport, along with all the passengers?</li>
<li>Why does the alleged Flight11&#39;s flight data recorder show that the airplane was too high to have even struck the lamp posts?</li>
<li> Why did they tamper with the only video they ever released, which does not show an aircraft, only a small explosion and why did the FBI confiscate all CCTV in the area, in a coordinated, almost pre-emptive swoop</li>
<li>Why does the NTSB not plan to issue a report or open a public docket? The NTSB has issued a report for all planes that crash in the U.S, not for 9/11, Why?</li>
<li>The physically impossible Barbara Olson phone calls</li>
</ul>

<p>How would it even be possible that the Pentagon was hit 1 hour and 20 minutes after the attacks began? Why was there no response from Andrews Air Force Base, just 10 miles away and home to Air National Guard units charged with defending the skies above the nation”s capital?</p>

<p>Tthe official account is truly bizarre, the probability that it can be true, is zero.</p>

<hr/>

<p>All evidence suggests that flight 93, which crashed over at Shanksville, broke up before impact, there were <a href="http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h79/willuk7/flight93crash.gif">debris fields</a> miles and miles apart to support this conclusion, Donald Rumsfeld even said the plane was shot down</p>

<p>But still, we are led to believe that the ground literally consumed the plane! That’s right, the government claims (without a shred of proof or any evidence at all offered to the world) that the plane ended up completely underground. Remember though, they found the drivers license of one of the alleged hijackers, a bit burnt and found ABOVE ground, i am not making this up, this is the official story.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi Mom, This is Mark Bingham&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Perhaps the most compelling evidence in favor of the demolition theory is that the NIST WTC Reports, which took up to seven years to produce, exhibit all six of the characteristics of politically motivated pseudoscience</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lack of experiment - NIST performed no physical experiments to support its conclusions</p></li>
<li><p>The results of experiments were ignored or contradicted in the conclusions - steel temperature tests performed on the few steel samples saved suggested that the steel reached only about 500 degrees Fahrenheit. This is more than a thousand degrees below the temperature needed to soften steel and make it malleable—a key requirement of NIST’s hypothesis</p></li>
<li><p>There was no peer review and public comments from peers were ignored - NIST published its own WTC reports and therefore its work was not subject to peer-review as is the case for all legitimate science.</p></li>
<li><p>The findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data - NIST will not share it computer models with the public. A NIST spokesman declared, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, that revealing the computer models would “jeopardize public safety.”</p></li>
<li><p>False conclusions are supported by media or marketing propaganda - NIST’s pseudoscience was fully and uncritically supported by the mainstream media, many journalists have since stated they were under pressure from management to not report 9/11 stories if they were critical of the official narrative.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypotheses that are supported by the evidence were ignored - Throughout its seven-year investigation, NIST ignored the obvious hypothesis for the destruction of the WTC buildings—demolition</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude, the WTC reports produced by NIST represent the most obvious example of politically motivated pseudoscience in history. The physical experiments NIST performed did not support its conclusions. The reports were not peer-reviewed and public comments that challenged the findings were ignored. NIST will not share its computer models (the last supposed evidence that supports its conclusions) with the public and therefore its conclusions are not verifiable.</p>

<p>There are many &quot;professionals and experts&quot; that have openly questioned the official story, and no doubt there are many who openly support that story - but there is a third category consisting of those who may question or disbelieve, but choose to keep their opinions to themselves.</p>

<p>Given the vicious, mocking attacks that so-called &quot;Truthers&quot; have endured professionally, in academia and the media, questioning the official line can have serious negative ramifications on one&#39;s life and career. Speaking out on such matters can be risky business.</p>

<p>Conversely, it takes no courage to parrot the official line. Go along to get along, or just keep your mouth shut.</p>

According to the American Institute of Architects,  there are <a href="http://www.aia.org/press/AIAS077761">105,847 licensed architects in the U.S</a>. So if all signatories of AE911 Truth are architects, only 2.206% of architects support AE911 truth. Including civil engineers, that number would be far lower as there are even more civil engineers in the U.S. than architects. </p>

<p>I know that&#39;s only 1 field and doesn&#39;t include pilots, first responders, etc. but I think its a pretty safe bet to say most experts support the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said before just because you speak out against something doesn&#39;t mean you support it.  By your logic you support the killing of all gays because the bible says so and all the jews because Hitler said so.  Hey you didn&#39;t sign the petition, you support it.  That is your logic which is stupid, there is no other word for it. </p>

<p>So again show me one example of more people SUPPORTING the official version. As I have clearly demonstrated just because you don&#39;t speak out against something doesn&#39;t mean you support it.  When it comes down to the end of the day whats more important to individuals the food on their table or exposing a government conspiracy?</p>

<p>As high school level science tells us steel melts at 2500 degrees F, jet fuel burns at 599 degrees F max.   No one with a college degree in the field of science will argue that.  The official 9/11 report argues that.  You are literally saying that majority of people in these scientific fields are going to support a report that complete contradicts basic science and math? Are you serious?</p>

<p>I am going to save some time and quote myself from above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order for something to be considered factual based on the scientific method, an experiment must be repeatable.  They made the data to verify their models classified on the grounds of &quot;national security&quot;. That makes their claim unprovable and also <strong>unproven</strong>. There is no way around this fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, you don&#39;t need a Ph.D. to know that if you do not release the data to support your theory then you can not accept that as a fact, so your other fallacy of &quot;argument from authority&quot; falls flat right there.</p>

<p>I know, personally, one of the people that worked on the WTC 7 report for the government.  He is like Einstein genius level smart and I have known him since childhood.  I have never discussed this with him and we have never talked about his job.  I know that he at least once was a good and moral person.</p>

<p>I am also a scientist who works in the private sector.  When you are working on a subject, you conduct your research based on exactly what your bosses want.  There is a difference between an assignment that states &quot;Find out the truth about what happened&quot; and one which states &quot;Prove that this scenario we have outlined is feasible.&quot;</p>

<p>These things happen.  I saw it happen in private industry.  Scientists are asked to support made up marketing bullshit.  The politics and pressure of being a high level government scientist is something I will probably never be able to fully comprehend.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you can understand how highly plausible this type of scenario is, especially when you consider that the data to actually prove their story to be true will not be released and is classified for &quot;national security&quot; reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on the same page as you. I think any cover up is of incompetence by the intelligence agencies rather than outright committing the act. Explains (but doesn&#39;t justify) the major lack of transparency. Both narratives have their holes, but to mind the official narrative has <em>far</em> less holes.</p>

<p>I also think a lot of the &quot;damning&quot; evidence for it being an inside job is mostly weird coincidences that could go either way. For example, the purported fact that there was some sort of CIA/FBI training for what to do if a plane hit a building is taken as just big of a coincidence to occur by chance. Okay then, what does that mean? The government would plan and execute a terrorist attack, but also plan what to do in case of such an attack and have the training on the very day of the actual attack to unnecessarily draw attention on themselves? I mean, is there an actual coherent narrative to how this piece of evidence is damning? I&#39;m honestly curious. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2z0it7/if_you_believe_the_official_story_of_911_what/cpgchmk">Just the other day</a> I did asked for someone to explain how the demolition of WTC 7 could fit into a false flag narrative and got no reply. Seems like a lot of grasping at straws. As someone who more or less believes the official narrative I&#39;m honestly curious how people think these &quot;damning&quot; pieces of evidence all fit together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that, but the guy who wrote Hunt for Red October also wrote a book about crashing planes into buildings years before 911 as I recall.  So maybe they just read his book or maybe he had an inside source and they were long ago looking into that possibility.  Can&#39;t recommend his novels as every page is a rah rah USA right wing rant, but he had some interesting foresight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another connection: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/thecoup.asp">this rap group called Coup was about to release and album featuring the dou blowing up the twin towers on the cover</a>. Are we going to start saying that these guys are connected or that maybe coincidences just happen?</p>

<p>My take is similar to what was stated in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yznRGS9f-jI&amp;amp;t=0m38s">this Erroll Morris short about the JFK assassination</a> that when you put an event, any event, under the microscope your going to find this weird world of strange coincidences and occurrences. These things occur all the time but no one notices. </p>

<p>I thought it would be cool to make a book or a documentary or whatever called &quot;9/11/00&quot; which would be a kind of thought experiment of what kind of nefarious coincidences we could find if we pretend 9/11 had occurred exactly one year earlier. If we were to put that date under a microscope would we find that it was presaged by drops or surges in airline stocks? Changes in the security at WTC or reports of suspicious workers on sight? Where was Bill Clinton that morning? That kind of stuff. Just taking a quick look at September 2000&#39;s wikipedia page we can see that in the week or so preceding 9/11/00 there was anti-globalization protests in Prague at the IMF and World Bank, a UN summit in NYC with the leaders of 180 nations,  a Swedish arms manufacturer was bought my the company United Defense, and there were fuel protests in the UK. Within the several weeks after 9/11/00 the Olympics had started, a Ukranian journalist was murder under suspicious circumstance, and the PM of Israel and a large contingent of security forces visit a holy site inciting Palestinian protests.</p>

<p>You would think the insurance company would be interested in proving that demolition brought down those 3 buildings. Over 4 billion dollars paid in terrorism jet fuel melted steel theory. There are thousands of architects and engineers that have testified that explosives brought those buildings down. Insurance companies fight paying the smallest claims, try collecting workman&#39;s  comp. for disability they follow you around with a camera waiting for you to slip up. Yet they have no interest in fighting an over 4 billion dollar payout. C&#39;Mon people this is your smoking gun !</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow okay...so I just watched this short video and although it might seem like an ancillary factor by itself, this almost undoubtedly shows that <strong>they planted evidence outside of the Pentagon to make it look like a plane hit it.</strong></p>

<p>SERIOUSLY, PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO!!! I feel like this is an extremely important piece of evidence, and its conclusions should not be taken lightly:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvyQ0vVwjqc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvyQ0vVwjqc</a></p>

<p>If a plane just unexpectedly hit the Pentagon, what reason would there be to stage a pole falling on the hood of a taxi cab? This proves that the somebody <strong>planted a pole on top of a taxi cab, and that the driver of the cab was told (or forced?) to give false testimony on what happened.</strong> His comments when he believed he wasn&#39;t being filmed tell the whole story. He pretty much admits that it was planned, and even without considering his comments it&#39;s easy to show the disconnect between the facts and the story through the pictures and witness accounts that contradict the official story.</p>

<p>If taken to its logical conclusion, it can only be assumed from this wonderful investigative video that <strong>powerful figures within our country knew about the attack on the Pentagon</strong>, and it doesn&#39;t take much imagination to go a step further and then assume that they must&#39;ve known about or helped orchestrate the entire thing.</p>

<p>If this single little detail is a proven to be a hoax, then it removes the credibility of all of the other official explanations. There&#39;s a lot of speculation and &quot;connecting the dots&quot; that we&#39;re forced to do when investigating 9/11, but this video is <strong>solid evidence</strong> that proves a cover up. Of course this is just another piece of evidence on top of many others, but I believe this to be more convincing than most others. I feel like I could show this to even a skeptic and get their gears moving what really happened on 9/11</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been mulling over my answer to such a question over the past few weeks and it&#39;s pretty similar to your answer to OP (but it was a 757) .  There are other gaping holes in the 9/11 story, but I think the Pentagon is a fairly straightforward argument:</p>

<p><strong>If</strong> a plane hit the Pentagon, there are three possibilities regarding the wings and engines of the plane.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Both wings and engines shear off the fuselage upon impact with the building exterior, and are therefore immediately outside the building.</p></li>
<li><p>Both wings and engines penetrate the exterior of the building and are therefore inside the building.</p></li>
<li><p>The engines strike the ground prior to impact with the building, shear off and are therefore outside the exterior by some distance.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These possibilities are easily refuted:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Photographs of the building shortly after impact show that the wings and engines are clearly not outside the building.</p></li>
<li><p>Photographs of the building after impact show no signs of penetration (or even damage!) where the engines possibly could have been.  We know the building and the plane dimensions.  Both engines cannot possibly fit into the damaged wall sections, so they are not inside the building.</p></li>
<li><p>Photographs of the lawn outside the building show no signs of impact prior to the building.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>No engines outside the wall.  No engines inside the wall.  No engines in the lawn.  No plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>South Tower Plane SPEED</strong> + Evidence of CD of the Twin Towers (and Building 7).</p>

<p>Vmo (never exceed speed) of a Boeing 767 is 360 knots CAS (calibrated airspeed). Loss of flight control occurs at 30 knots over Vmo or 390 KCAS. For a <em>manevering aircraft</em> the ONLY available safety margin (prior to the onset of a phenomenon called flutter and catastrophic failure) is between Vmo/Mmo and Vd/Md or between 360 KCAS and 420 KCAS.</p>

<p>South tower plane was recorded by multiple rader returns flying in tight flight control, while maneuvering, for up to approx one minute+, at 510-520 knots groundspeed. Nearer to sea level (ie: at about 1000 ft alt) this equates to a TAS (true airspeed) of approx 515 knots (slight headwind), and a CAS of approx 508 knots or </p>

<ul>
<li>118 knots (136 mph) PAST the point at which loss of flight control (by any pilot) is <strong>guaranteed</strong> for a standard, non-modified, Boeing 767. </li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, post-dive, the aircraft was recorded, by multiple radar returns as reported by the NTSB, as having ACCELERATED, to retain a 510 + knots groundspeed (= 515 knots TAS with a light headwind) nearer to sea level. This is way way wayyyy beyond the point that parasitic drag (think of the engines like giant parachute-like cups at high speed) has overcome thrust capacity for standard engines. Think near-sea level air density.. </p>

<p>Therefore, the plane that impacted the South Tower of the WTC on September 11th, 2001, MUST have been a highly modified, military-grade Boeing 767-type aircraft, with hardened structure, leading wing edge modifications and, with engine power/performance greater by something like at <em>least</em> 3 orders of magnitude, than standard. </p>

<p>This does not even address the issue of piloting by a complete novice who the 9/11 Commission itself indicated was no better trained or skllled as a pilot than his ex-room mate Hani Hanjor of Pentagon Plane flying fame. The day after 9/11, a group of seasoned pilots in a simulator, with many 1000&#39;s of hours of flight time on other aircraft types were unable to replicate the flight path to impact with the target unless they slowed the aircraft down to near landing speeds.</p>

<p>The entire range of the &quot;safety margin&quot;, for a <em>maneuvering</em> commercial jet aircraft, is between Vmo/Mmo and Vd/Md. </p>

<p>&quot;For much of it&#39;s final descent, UAL175 maintained a descent rate between 4000 feet per minute and 8000 feet per minute. During the descent from 12,000 feet to 6000 feet, the aircraft groundspeed remained between 500 - 520 knots. As the aircraft made it&#39;s final descent to 1000 feet, it ACCELERATED and impacted Word Trade Center tower #2 at approximately 510 knots groundspeed.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the max cruising speed, at 35,000 feet [.86M]</p>

<p>Note again, the TAS, EAS and CAS. </p>

<p>A couple of things to bear in mind. CAS is TAS adjusted for temperature and pressure altitude. As far as I know it&#39;s the same thing as IAS (indicated airspeed). Regardless, the Vmo/Mmo and Vd/Md limits of 360 kts and 420 kts respectively, are measured in CAS as you can see from the Boeing A1NM TYPE CERTIFICATE DATA SHEET. </p>

<p>Re: Groundspeed. </p>

<p>Groundspeed + Windspeed vector = TAS. On September 11th, 2001, there was a very light wind to the N/W as evidenced by the drifting smoke from the North Tower impact and fires, or a headwind, making a GS of 510 kts, a TAS of about 515 kts, which, at about 1000 ft alt = a CAS of about 508 kts. </p>

<p>So, in summary, instead of saying that I&#39;m totally wrong about this, you&#39;re reaction really ought to be along the lines of </p>

<p>And you&#39;ll see that in the case of the Airbus, they wore red jumpsuits so that they could be identified (just in case), and in flying the aircraft to it&#39;s Vd limit, it broke, they had to pull out of the very steady dive, and then do some serious modifications to obtain certification at the Vd/Md design dive limit speed. </p>

<p>There are btw, many precedents of aircraft flying past these limits, but not by very much and in every case, they experienced complete loss of flight control amid structural failure, and whether they barely managed to land isn&#39;t the point. They were out of control, diving, spinning and even then were travelling at 70 or more knots LESS than the south tower plane in terms of an eqivalent airspeed ie: total molecules of air passing over the airframe at any given instant.</p>

<p>Again, for a <em>maneuvering</em> aircraft, the only margin resides bewtween Vmo and Vd or in the case of the Boeing 767 between 360 and 420 KCAS. Even for ultimate design load limits they can only exceed the specs for mere seconds, and again, loss of flight control begins to occur at about Vmo + 30 kts or around 390 kts KCAS. </p>

<p>The S Tower plane was recorded on radar, via multiple radar returns, at a groundspeed of 510 knots, which translates into a CAS of about 508 knots, because at and nearing sea level, CAS, TAS and EAS become equal (at sea level).</p>

<p>I also pointed out that very experienced pilots flying in the simulator, were unable to replicate the flight path to the sliver of a target unless and until they reduced speed to near landing speeds. They did this as a team, over and over and over again, one after another until the team Captain was finally able to do it at a near Vmo speed (300 knots or therabouts, according to him). </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you really understand or appreciate the implications of this data if you&#39;re reaction is ho hum, those Islamic extremists sure got lucky i guess.. it doesn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>Re: Accuracy of the radar data from the NTSB analysis</p>

<p>For those of you who, in examining this data, might simply conclude that the NTBS Radar Data MUST be wrong and in error, please keep in mind that the NTSB used ASR radar from EWR, JFK, LGA, HPN as well as RADES for their analysis. The NTSB also did a video speed analysis which corresponds to their radar data study.</p>

<p>Those who feel the radar may be wrong therefore should not fly in or out of the NYTC terminal area as the same radar is used daily to assign speeds and vector aircraft for approaches to EWR, JFK, LGA and HPN.</p>

It can only have been a highly modified aircraft with much more powerful engines, and that said the burned out engine that was found and photographed on the street didn&#39;t fit the engine types for either aircraft anyway..  and neither was the hijacker passport found and handed over by an anonymous bystanders to a detective with Bernie Karik&#39;s department on the same street Vesey Street i think it&#39;s called, blocks away from the World Trade Center, even so much as singed or blemished. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i read a discussion about this on a pilots forum this morning. the actual founder of &#39;9/11 pilots for truth&#39; or whatever they call themselves argued for a few threads. he&#39;s a fucking idiot. every other pilot on the forum dissected everything, sounding credible as hell, while he dodged basically every question and kept pointing back to the same charts you&#39;re pointing to. borderline insanity. we watched the plane push past 500 knots.</p>

<p>i saw the radar data from NJ, too. UA175 was only exceeding Vmo in like the last 15 seconds, 100% throttle in a powered descent, before it hit the tower. maybe it was beginning to experience the structural failures everybody&#39;s pointing to at the last minute. doesn&#39;t really matter cause it impacted the building.</p>

<p>i know it&#39;s not your personal theory - it&#39;s apparently the a-hole who i wasted my time reading this morning - but to take this radar data and instead of saying &#39;well i guess a 767 can exceed Vmo&#39; claim that it wasn&#39;t the same aircraft is not only completely ludicrous it&#39;s completely disrespectful to the deceased who were on that flight. </p>

<p>still not a &#39;single best argument or piece of evidence&#39; in this entire thread. sorry you wasted your time on me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It exceeded both Vmo and Vd for up to about a minute, not the the last 15 seconds, although it even <em>accelerated</em>, post-dive, to retain in near level flight during the final target aquisitioning, a 510 knot groundspeed. </p>

<p>We&#39;re not just talking about Vmo + 150 knots but also Vd + 90 knots. </p>

<p>It can exceed Vmo, but at anything over 30 knots faster, and flight stability is lost, and that&#39;s still around 390 knots, relative to the 510 it was recorded at. </p>

<p>You&#39;re being deceptive. </p>

<p>Lastly, your Boeing at 500 + knots @ sea level example is also misleading or a lie. it was within Vmo or about 360 knots CAS at most - max operating speed.  </p>

<p>Deceptive, and then the insult about the victims, and the silent treatment - those are tactics not an argument. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s 510 knots or 590 mph, @ near sea level, compared to 360 knots (Vmo).</p>

<p>the airframe is not going to come apart if you exceed the operating specs you keep pointing out. Max Operating is not the sound barrier.</p>

<p>i see absolutely nothing in any of the video, any of the data, or any of the analysis from all the pilots i&#39;ve read that demonstrates any extremely excessive stresses put on the 767&#39;s airframe, yet you seem to believe that an aircraft&#39;s Vmo is some sort of Physical Speed Limit, that a stock 767 can&#39;t fly as fast as 175 did, maneuver as it did, or that by doing so it would somehow come apart. EgyptAir990 had insane stresses put on it and it still hit the water intact. Flight 93 hit the ground intact.</p>

<p>i love how you call me deceptive and that video of a Boeing a &#39;lie&#39; then post a video of Flight 175 that&#39;s been cropped to give it the illusion that it&#39;s moving faster than it was. i was only posting mine cause it showed a freaking plane flying 500 knots.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s a lie, like i said. It was 350 knots (less, as a groundspeed), or the Vmo for a 757. It <em>was</em> deceptive. You&#39;ve used it and lied about it <em>twice</em> now.</p>

<p><a href="http://rnzaf.proboards.com/thread/19260/rnzaf-display-fast-pass-speed">http://rnzaf.proboards.com/thread/19260/rnzaf-display-fast-pass-speed</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was the captain of that particular shot, filmed during a Squadron open-day a couple of years ago. It&#39;s part of a routine that has been performed over thirty times at various airshows and practices around the world including RIAT Fairford 2003, Kemble 2006, RAF Waddington 2006, Warbirds Over Wanaka 2004, Avalon 2005.</p>

<p>The low pass is flown into wind at 350 knots (indicated) and 100 feet above the runway. It&#39;s a 2g pull up to between 45 and 55 degrees nose up pitch (although there has been higher) and the zoom climb ends at an altitude between 8000 and 10000 feet depending on the type of pull up used. The sequence does not end with a loop as some of the readers speculate, but in fact with a 60 degree wingover at around 220 knots. It is easily possible to enhance this maneouver with a steeper climb and bank but there is no need - it is spectacular already, and safe. This would be utterly impossible unless it was a highly modified 767 type aircraft. That it accelerated, post dive, also reveals that it would have required engines more powerful by at least 3 orders of magnitude than standard engines, which, to even achieve the Vd/Md speed for certification flutter testing, must do so in a steady dive because drag has overcome thrust capacity.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Flight stability and flight control is lost starting at 30 knots over Vmo, or in the case of the 767 at about 390 knots. The plane that hit the south tower was seen, as per the video, flying in perfect flight control with deft maneuvering, at a speed of 508 kts CAS or 118 knots (136 mph) beyond the point at which flight control would be lost. It was also flying at 88 kts or 101 mph past the Vd design dive limit, which is a very hard outer flight envelope limit for a <em>maneuvering</em> aircraft of that type. </p>

<p>Yout &quot;argument&quot; begins and ends, like the NIST report regarding the destruction of the twin towers (and Building 7), with one and only one presumption, and that&#39;s just not the least bit scientific. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he almost missed because he was going so fast, because he was the inexperienced pilot he was, as you pointed out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In regard to &quot;he&quot; who i presume you mean the complete novice pilot that you assume to be at the helm of this aircraft, i offer you this for yours and the reader&#39;s evaluation. </p>

<p>In terms of the possible desired effect ie: if the plane impacts and fires were not in fact the direct and sole cause of the destruction of the buildings about an hour and an hour and a half later, then the angle of attack, hitting the building at a slight diagonal, was absolutely perfect (see pics of the fireball). It also supports the official story that the building hit lower, at higher speed and across multiple floors &quot;falls&quot; first, with the second tower doing the exact same thing a half hour later, even though it was impacted at the 95 floor level, where the first sells the cause of the second, which burned a half hour longer, never mind that until 9/11 never in the entire history steel structured high rise buildings ever collapsed due to fire, ever, and there&#39;ve been plenty of fires.</p>

<p>In other words we must also factor in evidence of the CD of the twin towers, working backwards to examine the aircraft with scrutiny.</p>

<p>Airbuss A320/80 flight certification flutter testing.</p>

<p>Vd design dive limit certification flutter testing (Airbus A320/80) (a slightly slower and less maneuverable aircraft than the Boeing 767-200/300/400 series)</p>

<p>MUST WATCH.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImSuZjvkATw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImSuZjvkATw</a></p>

<p>&quot;The dive speed is the absolute maximum speed above which the aircraft must not fly.&quot;</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://theflyingengineer.com/tag/airbus-a380/">http://theflyingengineer.com/tag/airbus-a380/</a></p>

<p>On the Airbus fly by wire aircraft, it is not possible to reach the dive speed, due to the flight envelope protections available in normal law. If the sidestick is maintained full forward, and the airspeed crosses VMO/MMO, the pitch nose-down authority smoothly reduces to zero at approximately VMO +16 / MMO + 0.04. This however, does not guarantee the airspeed stabilizing at this speed.</p>

<p>If MMO + 0.04 / VMO + 20kts is reached or exceeded, then a structural inspection is necessary. </p>

<p>Beyond MD (= MMO+0.07) / VD (= VMO + 31kts) (A320 family), structural disintegration can occur.</p>

<p>Here are the speeds for the A320, in Mach number and Kts. The lesser value must always be respected, at all times:</p>

<p>Dive Speeds:</p>

<p>VD/MD = 381kts/M0.89</p>

<p>Maximum Operating Speeds:</p>

<p>VMO/MMO = 350kts/M0.82</p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit to add: I stand corrected in so far as Vmo/Mmo appears to be the same as Max Operating Speed, whereby Never Exceed Speed is either the same as or just slightly higher, because at Vmo + 30 kts, loss of flight control begins to occur, so you obviously can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to go any faster than that, for the Boeing 767, 390 KCAS, like i said. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tywMLqVcBO4">S Tower monster-plane-as-missile was flying and maneuvering, deftly</a>, at 508 KCAS or 118 kts, or 136mph past the VFC I believe it&#39;s called or max speed for stability. It&#39;s also 148 knots or 170 mph over Vmo, and a full 88 knots or 101 mph over the Vd design dive limit of 420 KCAS, which for a maneuvering aircraft is THE hard outer flight envelope limit, as we just saw with that airbus flutter test during a steady dive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but the &quot;problem&quot; the 9/11 truth movement seems to be having is that it&#39;s placing an almost exclusive emphasis on WTC7, because planes did hit the twin towers, when we&#39;ve got to be able to address that also, and at the same time. </p>

<p>They say - but planes DID hit the twin towers! as if that proves the cause of their subsequent destruction, which appears to hold true to Occam&#39;s Razor, while making us appear ridiculous and absurd to say otherwise, a favorite joke of the likes of Bill Maher. </p>

<p>So we need to hit directly at the crux of the psy-op and the official story by talking about the plane(s) and the CD of the Twin Towers, also.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2zhw5l/what_do_you_believe_is_the_single_best_argument/cpjbzg3">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2zhw5l/what_do_you_believe_is_the_single_best_argument/cpjbzg3</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s all I&#39;m suggesting. </p>

<p>Saying - WTC wasn&#39;t hit by a plane, isn&#39;t a good argument, because the twin towers were, so what are we saying..? </p>

<p>To bring down the OS psy-op and it&#39;s lasting power to influence, we have to make people realize that the twin towers did not really &quot;collapse&quot; as a result of the plane impacts, but we can&#39;t just offer up all the evidence of CD without also dealing with the plane(s) or what are we saying - that the buildings were prepped and ready to be brought down with CD but only required a successful hijacking and piloting to target?</p>

<p>So the point I&#39;m trying to drive home is that evidence of CD of WTC7 points to CD of the Twin Towers, points to swapped military-grade, remotely piloted drone aircraft, to complete the heinous puzzle.</p>

<p>Somebody should document 9/11, NAFTA and the whole process that allowed US democracy to deteriorate into oligarchy. I will say this: I fully anticipate that the PNAC&#39;s Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses document will be compared to Mein Kampf by historians in the not so distant future.</p>

<p>Public record, physical evidence, and all these think tank documents. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt that as this century unfolds that people will look back to the first decade and go WTF happened there? Those three buildings didn&#39;t &quot;collapse&quot;! WTF?!</p>

<p>The 9/11 truth movement people will probably be seen as the first true patriots of the 21st century, for keeping it on the table and for preserving the historical record at places like History Commons, The Complete 9/11 Timeline and for Documentaries like &quot;September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor&quot; and even &quot;Loose Change&quot; as it&#39;s forerunner, which i myself even had a small hand in helping to bring about.</p>

<p>I agree. I also believe that one of the arguments of the debunkers will be proven true: It is impossible to maintain secrecy of such a large plot. As participants retire, the truth will come out. Much like JFK and MLK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One wonders if there&#39;s a % threshold of understanding and awareness in time and history that would either condemn someone like Philip Zelikow, or prevent his condemnation? </p>

<p>Truth is truth, no matter what side of the veil we reside on, isn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>What they seem to bank on, all these perpetrators and cover-up artists, is the idea and the concept that there is no real truth, and thus, no God, and no Justice, as a transcendent principal or as a fundamental reality. In other words, all that matters is what the predominant % of the people and the &quot;relevant&quot; ruling class &quot;believe&quot;, not what&#39;s real or really true. </p>

<p>Bush used to like to say that future history could judge him all it wants, because by then he&#39;d be dead. </p>

<p>But is this idea logical? </p>

<p>Might they not have to answer, if not in this lifetime then at it&#39;s end, to an absolute truth, even one that might contain and uphold the integrity of the individual spirit of each and everyone they&#39;ve victimized? </p>

<p>Will they not have to answer for their crimes if they are not placed in the dock of the court, in this life? </p>

<p>Does everyone just get off scott free provided they don&#39;t get caught? </p>

<p>I think theirs is a false premise, but i could be wrong and I guess time will tell. </p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder just who and how many people the likes of Philip Zelikow and Dick Cheney will have to answer to, when their time at the end of their life comes, and it comes fast (20 years is a blink of an eye). </p>

<p>Will people like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAyF8KmXORw">Kevin Cosgrove</a> just give them a free pass because a number much greater than 50% of the living still believe the official story? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s how real Justice works. I think they are probably mistaken, but, it wil be between them and God, who said &quot;let vengeance be mine. I will repay.&quot; </p>

<p>So our work then is really all about what might be called &quot;Historical Justice&quot; as a great point of historical LEARNING, not about vengeance or true Justice in the traditional sense of the word, but more importantly, and for the sake of the many victims, about what NOT to be, think, or do, or authorize with authority. </p>

<p>Personally I think the meaning of all this, from where we sit, is that &quot;they&quot; the so-called relevant ruling class or &quot;elite&quot; are no longer relevant, and that they have lost their authority to rule or govern, as evidenced by their &quot;fruits&quot;. </p>

<p>David Ray Griffin: Debunking 9/11 Debunking.</p>

<p>&quot;In the physical sciences, the best way to be labeled irrational is to argue for the occurrence of an absolutely unique event - one that has never happened before and that can never be replicated. And yet the official story claims that on 9/11, three steel-frame high-rise buildings suffered total collapse because of fire and externally caused damage, even though prior to 9/11 not a single-steel frame high rise building had ever suffered total collapse from any cause other than pre-set explosives. Also, no experiment to see whether fire and externally produced damage could induce total collapses has been performed or even proposed. Accordingly, the claim that three such collapses just happened to occur on 9/11 remains a claim in conflict with one of the basic principles of the scientific method.&quot; </p>

Commercial planes fly at between 500 and 600mph at cruising altitude, if you nosedive that same plane from cruising altitude down to the ground that plane will slow down on its way down.  Go ahead and phone Boeing and ask them if a 767 can fly at 580mph at 1000ft, they&#39;ll laugh at you and say categorically &#39;no&#39;.   It&#39;s the one thing that continually comes up at the pilots for 9/11 truth.  Those planes could never have been traveling at 580mph.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly...I mean what does the government have to lose from allowing multiple videos of the &quot;plane&quot; to be released if that is what honestly happened? Wouldn&#39;t it easily put to rest the wild and outrageous theories of a missile hitting it if they allowed more than a single 1 fps grainy video of  it to be released? Of course this suggests that maybe these theories aren&#39;t so wild and outrageous, and that likely they are just covering for their own lies. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also pretty strange that they said that the plane that hit the Pentagon swooped down and hit various light poles in its path...even though multiple witness accounts all say that the &quot;plane&quot; came from a completely different angle that wouldn&#39;t have touched those poles.</p>

<p>Even weirder is how the taxi driver who supposedly had a pole land on his cab both lied about where his taxi was, even when confronted with photographic evidence that disproved it, and then when he thought he wasn&#39;t being recorded went on to say that it was planned by powerful men. This video alone could make any 9/11 false flag skeptic question the official story:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvyQ0vVwjqc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvyQ0vVwjqc</a></p>

<p>I think the WTC arguments are definitely great too and hold a lot of weight, but I think sometimes people overlook The Pentagon too much when investigating what happened on 9/11. I think all of the contradictions with the offcial story, lack of physical evidence, and shady government actions present maybe even a more compelling case for conspiracy than the what happened with the towers. The fact that the headquarters of the most powerful military in history was hit by a passenger plane 35 minutes after the first attack on the WTC should just boggle anyone&#39;s mind. Are we to believe that they have no outside defense against something like that? That they didn&#39;t see it on radar multiple miles away and have the capability to easily shoot it down?</p>

<p>I mean,  watching Bldg 7 fall down is not an argument,  its just a strange phenomenon.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s admit it,  truthers can&#39;t prove what really happened,  not without a proper hearing,  a proper investigation.    The most convincing truthers are mainly good at pointing out the glaring problems with the official story,   which by now has become a national myth as powerful as the 4th of July.</p>

<p>Watching a person come to their senses regarding the official lies,  there is so much riding on it,  in terms of identities and memberships,  it might take a decade for truthers to find their place,  and learn how to deal with the believers.    Its like deprogramming a cult member.</p>

<p>Most truthers still fall for attacks by the believers of the official story,  and for diversions.</p>

<p>Most people think that if you deny the official version,  you MUST substitute a more convincing version.   When truthers fall for this,  they are dead meat,  from the point of view of an argument.    Because they have no more proof than the official story.   We haven&#39;t even learned how to argue after 14 years.</p>

<p>The technology revolution has transformed organizations across the private sector, but not ours, not fully, not yet. We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain. Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building because it&#39;s stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s not saying that money went missing, it&#39;s part of the Pentagon&#39;s budget and went towards military purchases.  He was just talking about their disjointed accounting practices in a push to unify all the systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s become an internet trope, but..... Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams. No way, no how. I really like how the architect of the towers said it, he described the buildings as able to withstand a collision by a jetliner like &quot;a pen through a mesh screen.&quot; So there&#39;s that. A more remote piece of evidence is something I saw on this sub a couple months ago, about how the WTC towers were filled with asbestos and the retrofit cost was significantly higher than the property value. That&#39;s some supreme duplicity tho, the gov&#39;t wants to prompt a war, a businessman wants to -literally- liquify his investment, dunno. But still odd</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt the fact that wtc7 reached free fall speed during its collapse is the most damning evidence.  It means there was no resistance given whatsoever by any of the support columns at the exact same time.  This does not happen in a natural collapse caused by fires on a few floors on one side if the building.  I would even say it is impossible for a steel framed skyscraper. </p>

<p>Of course NIST has their theory about how Building 7 collapsed but they refuse to release the model data so that it can be peer reviewed because &quot;safety&quot;.  Really they refuse to release it because it is impossible and if they did release it we would see that it is bullshit immediately.</p>

<p>There is enough out there to prove they did know it would happen, like ignored FBI warnings, MI6 and other intelligence around the world specifically warning the US of an incoming attack. </p>

<p>And you can&#39;t bring down a tower in a day, it takes weeks and months, maybe years of planning. </p>

<p>The implosion of a building is a highly skilled job, left only to a few top DU Companies in the world. 
Fire, according to the official account, gets the job done just as well. </p>
