       I read a lot of people here say that they're arguing with a neighbor or family member over something conspiracy related. In some threads this sub appears to be a self help group for conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I want an informal poll of how much of what you actually believe about reality is something you don't share with people close to you. As a control group think of how open people with political signs on their lawn, colored ribbons, bumper stickers are. Or consider most conversations over a beer where friends discuss "politics" and its really just vacuous left vs right stuff or regurgitating the corporate media talking points from the night before.
      </p>
      <p>
       To what percent do you live in a world where you openly discuss what you actually believe with that same level of freedom?

       I keep no secrets and hold nothing back from anyone, but I also don't go out of my way to spout ideas that I know will be unpopular or to make anyone uncomfortable.  People need to want to look into and discuss these topics on their own, you can't force the information on them.  If something comes up I'll discuss it, if I'm asked a question I'll answer it to the best of my ability, if I sense that a person might actually be interested in what I have to say I'll say it, otherwise I just keep it casual for the most part.

       It took me a long time to figure this out. Not because I was an obnoxious or over bearing asshole. But because I guess I didn't know how deep the rabbit hole went or how politicized certain words were (let alone issues.)
      </p>

       Previously when I started reading Chomsky and RAW, Vice, the gaurdian and adbusters. To me this stuff was just new sources of information with interesting insight. It took a while before I realized most people don't wanna hear about how the debt system was designed and installed after the 2nd world war while they're complaining about their rising tuition fees.

       FYI... I can't speak for RAW or adbusters, but Chomsky, VICE, and The Guardian are most definitely controlled opposition. Essentially, any source that parrots the official 9/11 story is pwnd.

       Well vice is bought and sold now. And I'm not dumb enough to believe EVERYTHING Gaurdian says but it does release articles that ask questions on a regular basis. As far as Chomsky, I've read a few of his books, seen tons of lectures. I don't buy that he is controlled opposition but I don't take his word as gospel either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it'd be dumb to trust anyone. But those three IMO seem less likely to tow the company line... well except vice now.

       There's truth in all of em, for sure. But you gotta keep your guard up -- their lies are less obvious than CNN or FoxNews. Chomsky, especially, is a sneaky bastard.

      <p>
       But yes, good point: even if you had a source that has been 100% accurate, you still can't blindly trust them. That trust will likely be used against you at some point.

       I'm not 100% in the open with my beliefs but I do share some of them. My parents tend to think I'm nuts, but I had a small victory the last time I saw them when they told me that they're starting to notice all of the stuff I'm talking about and are thinking I'm not so crazy anymore.

       I have a similar situation with my family except I noticed that its only with local politics. Everything I said about the way this town was run about 3 years ago which made them all think I was crazy has essentially become blatant and glaring and now they've all decided I was on to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as international stuff who knows. My one brother watches a lot of conspiracy vids and tried getting me into loose change but I had investigated it and found it was just trolling so things are tense because we don't believe in the SAME conspiracy.

       I think this is the biggest difference between "conspiracy theorists" and average people. Conspiracy theorists see the big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can take most average people like our parents and show them a particular case and they will most likely agree there was at the least major corruption. Then you try to use that as a stepping stone to the bigger picture and they just can't see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this is why the internet has made such a big impact. So many people having access to so much information. Everyone is starting to connect dots.

       Yeah. Toffler said that the internet would erode all previous institutions from government to universities to media. Anything where access to information had a pay gate or a gate keeper would crumble given enough time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However it'll also open people up to a lot of false information. But that isn't so bad as long as you're willing to do a little diligence. Wikipedia is a prime example, look how often people are caught trying to censor or alter info on there. In the past that stuff would have been printed and distributed with no discussion and no questioning.

       I generally try not to discuss politics with coworkers but if they ask me I won't lie about what I think on a certain topic. As for my friends and family, they all know where I stand. Some of my family (uncles &amp; aunts mostly) are the type of conservatives who still think Bush was a great president, so my cousins think its funny to start a political debate at family gatherings because they know I won't back down to the neocons of my family. My friends generally see things the same way I do, which I guess makes sense why I would consider them my friends.

       I unabashedly told my views to friends in Toronto. But not many were happy to hear. They just don't like to hear the negativity of it all. But on the other hand, I had to do what needed to be done. No regrets.

       Probably 80% of what I believe to be reality I keep to myself.  Reality is largely perception based, so mine will most likely be different from yours anyway.

       I too am like most of the other responses here. Won't go out of my way to push my ideas on people, but if asked my opinion on something I won't lie about how I feel.

       The problem comes when you share your view on a topic, and are then asked for an explanation of your opinion. If the reason for your opinion is based on a conspiracy "theory" of any kind, then tread carefully. Once you do that, the person may then discredit anything else you have said (even if it's totally logical/reasonable/accurate), and just write you off as a "crazy conspiracy theorist".

       I'm trying to think of an example of a time this happened to me. If I think of one, I'll update my post.

       I was labeled a crazy conpsiracy theorist because I tried to explain the concept of planned obsolescence to a girl who said it was  suspicious that her iphone seemed to die whenever a new one was slated to be released.

       I don't see how being a woman has anything to do with it, my GF happens to be a woman and she's smarter than me.

       I've seen people complain about women 'not getting it' on this sub, I don't know where that is coming from. my last 3 girlfriends were awake. Early into dating one even broke down and was like "before we go any further I just have to tell you that I don't think terrorists did 9/11 and I don't trust my government OK? Like this is important to me I have a lot of weird political beliefs we should talk about."

       My wife knows im rely into the ancient astronaut theories, and that i dabble in current events and politics and feel strongly about certain ideals. We dont discuss it much at all, as she views it to be too negative to dwell on.

       My best friend and i will chst about any and all of these topics, with a strong focus on individual and group manipulations via certain uses of words and body language while appealing to the mannerisms of the manipulatees, at least that which can be observed.

       Thats about it... I have talked with my grandfather briefly about a few things, and his perspective was interesting, so say the least.

       It's pretty rough for me. Most of my friends are open minded, but they're not so into discussions of conspiracy theories. They just don't want to worry about it. I talk with whoever I can about it because I hate being bottled up. I talk to my SO about stuff going on, but it really brings her down. So I'm at a spot where I want to tell people the truth, but no one is listening. And those who are listening just accept it and say, "Oh well, there's nothing we can do."

       i prefer not to offer info unless asked or something is mentioned, many people are content in "their bubble", the truth is very scary &amp; some just don't want to know.
