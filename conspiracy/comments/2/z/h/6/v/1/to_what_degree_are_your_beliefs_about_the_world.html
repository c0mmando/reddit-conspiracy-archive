<p>So I want an informal poll of how much of what you actually believe about reality is something you don&#39;t share with people close to you. As a control group think of how open people with political signs on their lawn, colored ribbons, bumper stickers are. Or consider most conversations over a beer where friends discuss &quot;politics&quot; and its really just vacuous left vs right stuff or regurgitating the corporate media talking points from the night before.  </p>

<p>To what percent do you live in a world where you openly discuss what you actually believe with that same level of freedom? </p>

<p>It took me a long time to figure this out. Not because I was an obnoxious or over bearing asshole. But because I guess I didn&#39;t know how deep the rabbit hole went or how politicized certain words were (let alone issues.) </p>

<p>Previously when I started reading Chomsky and RAW, Vice, the gaurdian and adbusters. To me this stuff was just new sources of information with interesting insight. It took a while before I realized most people don&#39;t wanna hear about how the debt system was designed and installed after the 2nd world war while they&#39;re complaining about their rising tuition fees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI... I can&#39;t speak for RAW or adbusters, but Chomsky, VICE, and The Guardian are most definitely controlled opposition. Essentially, any source that parrots the official 9/11 story is pwnd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well vice is bought and sold now. And I&#39;m not dumb enough to believe EVERYTHING Gaurdian says but it does release articles that ask questions on a regular basis. As far as Chomsky, I&#39;ve read a few of his books, seen tons of lectures. I don&#39;t buy that he is controlled opposition but I don&#39;t take his word as gospel either. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;d be dumb to trust anyone. But those three IMO seem less likely to tow the company line... well except vice now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s truth in all of em, for sure. But you gotta keep your guard up -- their lies are less obvious than CNN or FoxNews. Chomsky, especially, is a sneaky bastard.</p>

<p>But yes, good point: even if you had a source that has been 100% accurate, you still can&#39;t blindly trust them. That trust will likely be used against you at some point.</p>

<p>As far as international stuff who knows. My one brother watches a lot of conspiracy vids and tried getting me into loose change but I had investigated it and found it was just trolling so things are tense because we don&#39;t believe in the SAME conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is the biggest difference between &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and average people. Conspiracy theorists see the big picture.</p>

<p>You can take most average people like our parents and show them a particular case and they will most likely agree there was at the least major corruption. Then you try to use that as a stepping stone to the bigger picture and they just can&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>Maybe this is why the internet has made such a big impact. So many people having access to so much information. Everyone is starting to connect dots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Toffler said that the internet would erode all previous institutions from government to universities to media. Anything where access to information had a pay gate or a gate keeper would crumble given enough time. </p>

<p>However it&#39;ll also open people up to a lot of false information. But that isn&#39;t so bad as long as you&#39;re willing to do a little diligence. Wikipedia is a prime example, look how often people are caught trying to censor or alter info on there. In the past that stuff would have been printed and distributed with no discussion and no questioning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I generally try not to discuss politics with coworkers but if they ask me I won&#39;t lie about what I think on a certain topic. As for my friends and family, they all know where I stand. Some of my family (uncles &amp; aunts mostly) are the type of conservatives who still think Bush was a great president, so my cousins think its funny to start a political debate at family gatherings because they know I won&#39;t back down to the neocons of my family. My friends generally see things the same way I do, which I guess makes sense why I would consider them my friends.</p>

<p>The problem comes when you share your view on a topic, and are then asked for an explanation of your opinion. If the reason for your opinion is based on a conspiracy &quot;theory&quot; of any kind, then tread carefully. Once you do that, the person may then discredit anything else you have said (even if it&#39;s totally logical/reasonable/accurate), and just write you off as a &quot;crazy conspiracy theorist&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to think of an example of a time this happened to me. If I think of one, I&#39;ll update my post.</p>
