        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Then isn&#39;t that also saying terrorists and mad bombers and lone wolfs and anarchists the world over don&#39;t need any bomb making materials or training or skill or anything other than a bic and some lighter fluid in order to enact their own project mayhem? </p>

<p>And if that is true then why aren&#39;t we seeing a rash of these attacks? The CIA and FBI investigations I&#39;ve read about all center on controlling and monitoring access to bomb making materials. Whats the point if a pack of matches can bring down a sky scraper?</p>

<p>That might sound flippant, but I want you to think about what the official story of WTC7 and the 2 towers would mean if it were true. Fire alone can collapse buildings. And in the case of WTC7 fire from office furnishings. Instead of saying &quot;oh then why haven&#39;t other buildings collapsed?&quot; Think of it like &quot;Why would a terrorist need anything other than a zippo to pull off the next 9/11&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this myself. Instead of learning about physics and engineering and demolition you could start a company that just melts buildings with a little jet fuel. Or since WTC7 set precedent, you can start your own business demolishing buildings by setting office furniture you got from goodwill on fire around one column and presto bango you got your collapse. You&#39;d completely disrupt the demolitions industry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NIST actually admitted that fire alone caused the collapse.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Would WTC 7 have collapsed even if there had been no structural damage induced by the collapse of WTC 1?</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes. Even without the structural damage, WTC 7 would have collapsed from the fires that the debris initiated. The growth and spread of the lower-floor fires due to the loss of water supply to the sprinklers from the city mains was enough to initiate the collapse of the entire building due to buckling of a critical column in the northeast region of the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well they&#39;d have to strain the cities emergency response systems so that any response is haphazard, and also damage a watermain beyond quick repair to make it more difficult to water to the fire.

<p>but realistically, a bic and some lighter fluid might, per the argument, bring down the building</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OP was arguing that, per NISTs statements, terrorists could just use bic lighters and some lighter fluid to bring down buildings. I was trying to explain that by using this logic to support his stance (which is against the NISTs claims) he is being disingenuous as it is an example of using logical fallacies in a debate. </p>

<p>I dont believe that small office fires could bring down these buildings (i went to engineering school, btw), so i am, too, against the NISTs statements, and i align myself in a general sense to OPs position. I just dont agree with the structure of his argument within this post for the aforementioned reasons..</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Yeah and I think you&#39;re absolutely missing the point. NIST said that a fire surrounding one column on one floor and was fueled by nothing more than office furniture was enough to collapse a whole building. YES or NO?  Do not try and answer this question with a &quot;but&quot;. Answer it Yes or no. </p>

<p>One man with matches and lighter fluid (and for arguments sake manually turning off the sprinklers) can easily replicate a fire around a column on a single floor- YES or NO? Don&#39;t try and say &quot;but then&quot; cause that ain&#39;t the point. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re completely missing the fucking point if you think my argument is too simplistic. THe fucking point is that <strong>this is all the info that NIST is willing to release!!!</strong> We don&#39;t even know <strong>how long</strong> the fire would have to burn. </p>

<p>Until they release more info all we know is that a fire localized to one floor around one column is enough to bring down a sky scraper. <strong>Do you understand?</strong> That is the official story. </p>

<p>Thus <strong>by that logic</strong> replicating that exact scenario as outlined by the <strong>limited information</strong> provided by NIST would be as simple as starting a fire with a  pack of matches and some lighter fluid. </p>

<p>However long it&#39;d have to burn, how you keep the firemen out, how you get in the room. <strong>None of that effects the science.</strong> That is up to the imagination of the individual terrorist, that would be a situation to situation solution. The nuts and bolts would be getting a centralized fire around 1 pillar.  </p>

<p>And if NIST actually believed this was true, if the government actually thought a small fire could drop a 47 story sky scraper then that means by whatever nefarious plan, however the terrorists make it happen, all they&#39;d have to do to drop a building is start a fire and let it burn. </p>

<p>Not learn how to make bombs, not secure explosive materials, not hi-jack planes, not sticking fertilizer in a U-Haul, not making your shoes and underwear into a bomb. None of that. Just light a match and let it burn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read the NIST findings they said it was a fire fueled by office furniture on one floor around one column. Also there are some reports that the sprinklers didn&#39;t work. Thus all you&#39;d have to do to repeat this is shut off the sprinklers, and start an office fire on one floor with the available office furniture that would fit around 1 column. This is what NIST has claimed and this is what my observation is based on. </p>

<p>This is what i was referring to. I was tempting to answer this, by saying in general, these attacks would be frivolous as the petty fires would be easy to quell, hence why we dont see these types of attacks...</p>

<p>And thereby using this argument to support your position against the NISTs would make it a bit... disingenuous.... as it can be viewed as a false dilemma...</p>

<p>I wasnt aware that firefighters were in wtc7. But nonetheless, the &quot;small office fires&quot; escalated. </p>

<p>In the scenario you depict about a terrorist and a bic with some lighter fluid, and your questioning of why we dont see those kinds of attacks, is a false dilemma, because it should be obvious that whatever the little jihadi can do with such things would be easily and quickly put out, mitigating the risk of building collapse (which, ftr, i find hard to swallow the idea that fires can bring down steel-construct buildings in the first place).</p>

<p>My whole purpose in this thread isnt to attack you or to argue with you. I just wanted to help point out a flaw in the structure of your position that uses the hypothetical (maybe rhetorical?) argument of terrorists with bics setting small office fires to bring buildings down. </p>

<p>It&#39;s guilt by association. Whether posters here realize it or not, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a political dissident forum. Dissidents are always attacked and harassed by the powers that be.</p>

<p>Simply suggesting that powerful people &quot;conspire&quot; together is a &quot;conspiracy theory.&quot; &quot;Conspiracy theory&quot; is a modern term for &quot;witchcraft&quot; or &quot;heresy.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, you will be attacked using all of the &quot;Enemy Face&quot; terms. You&#39;re a &quot;hater&quot; a &quot;racist&quot; and an &quot;anti-semite&quot; who believes in &quot;crazy conspiracy theories.&quot;</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it fascinating the hostile reaction this subreddit gets? It&#39;s just some fringe forum on reddit. People post links to various news events and question it.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s attacked as Evil &quot;Joo-hating&quot; and forum posters are called all sorts of names.</p>

<p>Weird, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>I was wondering how fast you&#39;d resort to personal attacks.   You did not disappoint!</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing.  Instead of continuing to argue your stance, or simply ignoring me, the majority of you guys jump right in to personal attacks.  Apparently debating ideas is hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this myself. Instead of learning about physics and engineering and demolition you could start a company that just melts buildings with a little jet fuel. Or since WTC7 set precedent, you can start your own business demolishing buildings by setting office furniture you got from goodwill on fire around one column and presto bango you got your collapse. You&#39;d completely disrupt the demolitions industry. </p>
