<p>Reddit is a government propaganda site.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been censored for posting historical events directly as they are stated in academically approved history books. I&#39;ve also been censored by the sports Mod for posting negative comments about his favorite team and players.</p>

<p>The co-founder of Reddit killed himself due to government censorship and harassment. His father says the government killed him. This is how the government got Reddit to censor people.</p>

<p>Former mods have exposed Reddit for forcing them to censor dissent.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the proof.</p>

<p><a href="http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-27100773">http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-27100773</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/02/reddit-censors-story-government-manipulation-disruption-internet.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/02/reddit-censors-story-government-manipulation-disruption-internet.html</a></p>

<p>This has to stop. Reddit only let&#39;s you say and hear want they allow you to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m creating a website where Reddit users can upload screenshots and write about their Reddit censorship experiences as well as bad experiences they&#39;ve had with mods.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not looking for monetary contributions. Just checking to see if anyone wants to help contribute towards a good cause.</p>

<p>Worst case scenario is that if successful, these types of censorship tactics could become more widespread within journalism. Reddit may just be a litmus test to see how people react before mass implementation.</p>

<p>The threat of this extends beyond Reddit. This is a battle for a free society.</p>

<p>COMING SOON:</p>

<p>WWW.RedditCensorship.com</p>

<p>EDIT: If you notice, the people that disagree with me all say;</p>

<p>&quot; Reddit is privately owned and has the right to censor people &quot;</p>

<p>Just because something is legal does not make it right.</p>

<p>What kind of sheep of person defends censorship because &quot; it&#39;s legal &quot; ???</p>

<p>Especially when Reddit advertises itself as a democracy.</p>

<p>Reddit is an insult to free speech.</p>

<p>The mods think they are untouchable, so they think they can do whatever they want.</p>

<p>It goes even deeper..</p>

<p>I&#39;m still compiling all their known methods.</p>

<p>They know that the amount of votes a submission or comment gets has the ability to influence and potentially form public opinion and they know how to manipulate this system.</p>

<p>Sometimes a comment or submission gets removed and you&#39;d never know unless you signed out of your account because while signed in it appears to still be visible.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s not even possible to see all of the comments in a thread, even if there&#39;s only 10 or so comments ( so device memory isn&#39;t a factor).</p>

<p>I&#39;m still in the process of figuring out the intricacies. I&#39;m quite certain there&#39;s an automated algorithm working behind the scenes to filter out or flag submissions/comments.</p>

<p>No system is perfect, so I don&#39;t usually complain about these seemingly small things. But I feel sometimes this is done on purpose. By bending the rules, they can in a way control the discourse. Thanks for your work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A demagogue appeals to emotional and intellectual weakness through popular desires and prejudices rather than attempting rational argument.  They are rhetoricians, masters of sophistry.</p>

<p>Your username page, <a href="/u/RedditCensorshipX">/u/RedditCensorshipX</a>, is accessible.  These pages return a &quot;not found&quot; error when a user has been shadowbanned.  I was not alerted to your comment when you replied, so it seems you have only been shadowbanned in this particular subreddit.  More interesting than that is that a moderator would then have to approve your individual comments.  So... one moderator removes you and another one is your guardian?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is a privately owned site. That means they can do what they want with it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why this is such a hard concept for conspiracy theorists. I thought they were usually in support of a company being able to do what it wants with its business. If Reddit wants to censor the words &quot;red, cars, and tulips&quot; that is its prerogative. </p>

<p>I really miss the days when conspiracy theory used to be an intelligent debate about facts and not children spewing whatever nonsense they come up with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the point is that reddit wants you to think it&#39;s an open forum when in reality it isn&#39;t. So the conspiracy is that they are telling you that it&#39;s an open forum as long as you abide by certain rules, however the truth is that there&#39;s a lot more manipulation of the content then they&#39;d have you believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, but can&#39;t you start your own subreddit and mod it yourself and then allow no censorship on your subreddit?  Not saying I agree with the censorship on any subreddit, but I always felt the beauty of Reddit, was if something like that happened  in any subreddit, then people could just change to a different one where that didn&#39;t occur.</p>

<p>I support your position OP, just wanted to make that clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just made my voat account, however it can&#39;t handle all the traffic it&#39;s getting at the moment. My account was shadowbanned a week ago for &quot;upvoting the same comment twice&quot; from the same IP. My husband and I have both been redditors for years and upvoted each other&#39;s comments before with no problem. The minute I start pissing people off with unpopular opinions, BANNED. To their credit they removed the ban after I bitched about it for a week, but the damage has been done. If reddit doesn&#39;t want to be an open forum that&#39;s their own prerogative, but I will definitely stop coming here once voat can handle the traffic.  </p>
