    <div class="md"><p>Pure life comes first. </p>

<p>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name&#39;s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first. (‭Matthew‬ ‭19‬:‭16-30‬ KJV)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You turn on your TV News, and it&#39;s all fear.  Actually, it&#39;s mostly fake fear, because real life just isn&#39;t scary enough for them,</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the commercials; short-stories of why you should fear not having this product.</p>

<p>Go ahead, turn off the TV, but then you won&#39;t know how to communicate with your co-workers, and that might cause them to turn against you, and you sure can&#39;t lose your job.</p>

<p>You have bills to pay along with having to buy the newest things to keep up the illusion that you&#39;re an acceptable person, or else other people will not like you.</p>

<p>Wake up when the alarm says and then set out to do everything you can to keep up the illusion that you are acceptable.  Sorry, but this will take every single day of your life.</p>

<p>This is Satan&#39;s Earth. Satan gets to test God&#39;s ultimate creation. God is using Satan. Satan is what helps push humans towards perfection or away from it. </p>

<p>The Father gave it to him. Satan was one of the top Angels once upon a time. Satan got upset that Adam got a Chick. No bullshit. </p>

<p>The Second Coming of Christ will be low key. To many waxed hearts to accept Christ at first. The Third Woe is when everyone on Earth will know Christ is real. If they deny Christ at that point they deserve brimstone. It&#39;s going to be a massive event that hasn&#39;t happened since the beginning of existence that everyone will experience together.</p>

<p>No one gets judged based on their flesh. </p>

<p>Sorry, I don&#39;t know how to quote properly on reddit.</p>

<p>You know I didn&#39;t mean race, I meant people that grow up in gangs and whatnot. I specifically said black because they are more prone to discrimination, in fact, wayyyy more prone to discrimination.</p>

<p>The major problem I have with what you say is it -requires- people to be within the system to know Jesus. </p>

<p>If I were to ever have a kid, I would move into the woods and raise him outside of the system, would my kid be sentenced to hell because I wanted to keep my kid away from the vile system that controls this planet? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Father knows everyone&#39;s circumstsnces. He knows who believes He exists. That&#39;s the most important thing He cares about. Jesus is a double edge sword type of thing.

<p>Truth is stranger than fiction. </p>

<p>That&#39;s man vs man talk. Have you ever read through one of the four gospels in its entirety? It&#39;s nothing like Sunday school. </p>

<p>To me eternal punishment would be giving these guys a break. They are vile in every way imaginable and some are even beyond that. </p>

<p>The Bilderbergs and the rest of the super rich have sealed their fates. They murdered millions of people including hundreds of thousands of children. Eternal punishment is a break for what they are responsible for. </p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Blythe901.html">Blythe901</a> 2015-03-17</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Okay so, the murdered people (which I get it, I feel for too) will just go on to the next life, while the Bilderbergs will burn for all eternity? </p>

<p>I totally understand, every time I read what&#39;s going on in the world I think of how awful this world is because of them, but this life is a microscopic part of our eternal soul. To punish the Bilderbergs because of this would basically say &quot;You messed up this ONE life, now you must BURN FOREVER!!!&quot;. Do you realize how absurd it is?</p>

<p>I&#39;m the type of person that knows MOST of what there is to know, I&#39;m so far down the rabbit hole I couldn&#39;t get halfway back out if I wanted to. I&#39;ve watched the Gaza livestream with the ominous flares in the sky, bombs dropping, people screaming in terror, crying. I&#39;ve watched people be murdered in cold blood. I&#39;ve PERSONALLY WATCHED the worst of the worst. All so I could understand the world better. </p>

<p>I think these people are evil, but, I&#39;ve also heard they undergo insane ritualistic torture as children and are BRED for their role in the world. They are STRIPPED of their emotions as children, it&#39;s not like you or me going in to power knowing full well what it is doing to others. </p>

<p>You have to understand the entire scope, not everything is what it seems. There is one Rothschild in particular that I read about, he went through unimaginable torture to prepare him for his &quot;role&quot; as one of the Bilderbergs. Is he evil? Or was he conditioned to be evil? EDIT - <a href="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/christopherhelman/files/2014/07/744x1128.jpg">http://blogs-images.forbes.com/christopherhelman/files/2014/07/744x1128.jpg</a> - there&#39;s a picture of him, look at how messed up he looks, that is NOT natural. That has to have come from abuse, either that or he&#39;s an alien, but I&#39;m believing it came from his abuse.</p>

<p>The gangsters in the inner city, that murder people, steal, lie, etc... Are they evil? Or are they rejected by society, find it hard to find jobs, and resort to the only way of feeling accepted, which is to find a gang to join? </p>

<p>How can you EVER say someone deserves eternal punishment when you don&#39;t know the whole story? What if these people were here to help us? How do you know they&#39;re not? Your view of reality is limited, anything is possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan was Gods favorite Angel. He even had authority in heaven. When man was created Satan got Jelly. When Eve got created Satan lost it.
