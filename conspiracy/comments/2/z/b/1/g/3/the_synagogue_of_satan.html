       You can argue about Satan's existence all you want, but Satan's followers exist without a doubt. They have real power here on Earth. Progress will never be made without taking on The Beast. It's already written.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. (‭Revelation‬ ‭2‬:‭9‬ KJV)
      </p>
      <p>
       Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. (‭Revelation‬ ‭3‬:‭9‬ KJV)

       It has crossed my mind to mention those verses every time I see someone post that kind of unadulterated hatred that only be focused to a laser fine point with practice.  People don't want to accept that the battle is spiritual.

       It is a Spiritual War, but flesh is paying the price for it. There is a way for a few of us to turn the tables. It will be easy to do too. The hard part is finding the few that are down to take a leap of pure Faith.

       Pure life comes first.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first. (‭Matthew‬ ‭19‬:‭16-30‬ KJV)

       Let's go broke and save the world. All I have left is my MacBook, some skateboards and my iPhone. I gave my money to my sister and her two kids already. God can fuck off if he thinks they aren't poor enough in all honesty. To me the moral of the verse was to put all fears aside and just go for it.

       Every person needs to make their choice.  It isn't a choice of Republican versus Democrat.  Neither is it about the rich versus the poor.  It's not about black versus white.

      <p>
       What it's all about is love versus fear.

       You turn on your TV News, and it's all fear.  Actually, it's mostly fake fear, because real life just isn't scary enough for them,
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the commercials; short-stories of why you should fear not having this product.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead, turn off the TV, but then you won't know how to communicate with your co-workers, and that might cause them to turn against you, and you sure can't lose your job.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have bills to pay along with having to buy the newest things to keep up the illusion that you're an acceptable person, or else other people will not like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wake up when the alarm says and then set out to do everything you can to keep up the illusion that you are acceptable.  Sorry, but this will take every single day of your life.

       You know, I want to believe the "scriptures".

      <p>
       I really really do, but I can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was a "good" force in the world that could eliminate these people "who claim they are Jews but are not", then they should've done it A LOOOOOONG time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF the scriptures are true, why are they waiting until there is absolute suffering on the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have -nothing- against the "scriptures", I think there is a lot of good in there, I just think that the ultimate way to deceive is to offer 70-95% truth, then fill the rest with lies.

       Why is our food poisoned, our water filled with fluoride, our vaccines filled with mercury, our air sprayed with chemicals, our governments/media/entertainment under total control, invasions backed by propaganda that have killed millions, human sacrifices happening, child sex rituals happening, etc etc?

       Let's assume the scriptures are 100% true, are we to be judged the same regardless of upbringing? What about some guy who grew up in Africa? Will he be going to hell because he didn't accept Jesus? What about some guy that grew up on a remote island, will he being going to hell because he didn't accept Jesus? What about a Buddhist raised entirely by Buddhists? What about a guy raised on Taoism? Hinduism? Are they all hell-bound?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about an inner city black kid that was raised on violence, is he going to be judged the same as a suburban white guy with a good upbringing?

       Judgement brings fear, why does God promote fear if it is the opposite of love?

       Why would a being of "pure love" send people to a place to be tortured for all of eternity?

       You say the people are the problem, yet, we've grown to live in complete fear of what is said in the Bible, isn't it almost entirely the scriptures fault?

       The Second Coming of Christ will be low key. To many waxed hearts to accept Christ at first. The Third Woe is when everyone on Earth will know Christ is real. If they deny Christ at that point they deserve brimstone. It's going to be a massive event that hasn't happened since the beginning of existence that everyone will experience together.

       You know I didn't mean race, I meant people that grow up in gangs and whatnot. I specifically said black because they are more prone to discrimination, in fact, wayyyy more prone to discrimination.

       The Father knows everyone's circumstsnces. He knows who believes He exists. That's the most important thing He cares about. Jesus is a double edge sword type of thing. It's almost better to not know Jesus because if you do and turn away from his real teachings you're doomed.

       I totally understand, every time I read what's going on in the world I think of how awful this world is because of them, but this life is a microscopic part of our eternal soul.

I've watched the Gaza livestream with the ominous flares in the sky, bombs dropping, people screaming in terror, crying. I've watched people be murdered in cold blood. I've PERSONALLY WATCHED the worst of the worst. All so I could understand the world better.

       I think these people are evil, but, I've also heard they undergo insane ritualistic torture as children and are BRED for their role in the world. They are STRIPPED of their emotions as children, it's not like you or me going in to power knowing full well what it is doing to others.

       You have to understand the entire scope, not everything is what it seems. There is one Rothschild in particular that I read about, he went through unimaginable torture to prepare him for his "role" as one of the Bilderbergs. Is he evil? Or was he conditioned to be evil? EDIT -

       - there's a picture of him, look at how messed up he looks, that is NOT natural. That has to have come from abuse, either that or he's an alien, but I'm believing it came from his abuse.

       The gangsters in the inner city, that murder people, steal, lie, etc... Are they evil? Or are they rejected by society, find it hard to find jobs, and resort to the only way of feeling accepted, which is to find a gang to join?

       How can you EVER say someone deserves eternal punishment when you don't know the whole story? What if these people were here to help us? How do you know they're not? Your view of reality is limited, anything is possible.

       Only God gets to Judge. No jury. I'd drop the hammer to much. You wouldn't drop it enough. That's why He is Perfection and we are us. Everyone gets a chance in front of The Father though. No escape from it.

       So what's so bad about Satan? Sure u can argue what God said about him but how come he's like upon so negativity when God killed millions of people in his own book? How many people did satan kill in the bible?

       Satan was Gods favorite Angel. He even had authority in heaven. When man was created Satan got Jelly. When Eve got created Satan lost it. The rebellion led by Satan is responsible for all the killings. They created the problems that killed millions. God wants everyone to live forever.
