I could barely see it, but it looked like 5 little blue dots (looked like stars) in a v-shaped pattern hauling fucking ass across the sky. And then I kept looking and it kept coming around again and again from one corner of my eye and I could watch it for about 4-5 seconds before it was out of sight. Never seen anything like that in my day. Could it be surveillance or aliens? Idk, what do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This just doesn&#39;t make any sense.  I&#39;ve never smelled a more rotten red herring than an attempt to blame all of the world&#39;s ills on a single, nefarious US government defense contractor.  There are many players complicit in a larger game.  The military-industrial complex is not a monolith and there is absolutely no precedent or justification for the interpretation that Northrop Grumman is a single, unduly powerful &quot;Big Bad&quot;.</p>

<p>This is all not rational.  Notice how I am not insulting you as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;?  I believe in lots of conspiracies.  My point is that this posit is not valid.  It is not falsifiable, it is not a rational assumption anymore than the idea that there is a cabal of less than a hundred exclusively Jewish men making unilateral executive decisions for the world.</p>

<p>The reality of the suppression of the majority of the human populace is incredibly complicated.  I do not claim to know every detail, but I do understand that it is not as simplistic as one evil power over all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should point out not that the SR71 was invented fifty years ago (so was basic packetized data transfer over copper lines), but that it was officially retired in 1998.  That is, to me, the salient point that illustrates the necessity--in the eyes of the military--for something better to have taken its place.</p>

<p>Still, I don&#39;t find it credible that any human beings are able to manipulate gravity contemporaneously as we do not yet have a dominant theory for the nature of its mediating particle nor is there even a consensus as to whether it even has a mediating particle.  However, the idea of a &quot;TR6 Telos&quot; is interesting in that the V-shape of lights is often observed in the rare, clear night video recordings of UFOs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>If you check out Graham Hancock&#39;s work, I think it&#39;s essentially conclusive that there was an earlier advanced civilisation that had spread across the world. By exploring that link further, you find it highly likely that many of the myths of Atlantis actually have some degree of factual accuracy to them. Many P Hall talks about the seeding of many of the civilisations that preceded this by a strange being that disseminated knowledge from the fallen civilisation. The presence of the flower of life pattern within these same civilisations suggests that this, along with the pyramidal structure and their rigorous understandings of astronomy may have been some of the knowledge that was passed on.</p>

<p>When you look at the fate of this lost civilisation, you find it most likely that it perished in a giant cataclysm some 12 500 years ago. This raises some interesting similarities with some of the events of the old testament, as well as the sources that the Sumerian&#39;s acquired their knowledge from. This Sumerian story also references sky people who descended on the planet and seeded the earlier civilisation.</p>

<p>Now when we start to look at some of the mysteries of this alternative archeological record, we discover extremely sophisticated and precise construction techniques and in a sense a coordinated global effort to position many of these mysterious structures in an astronomical map. The construction of these structures is also shrouded in mystery simply from the sheer force necessary to build them. The great pyramid of Giza would have required one stone to be laid every 3 minutes for it be constructed by the 100 000 slaves in the apparent 20 years.</p>

<p>If we consider perhaps that this earlier civilisation that precedes all the others had access to some advanced technology and were in fact sky people (ET&#39;s) as suggested by the story of the Annunaki and books such as the the lost book of enki (which has significant overlap again with the old testament) it becomes possible that some of the information that passed on through to the other civilisations was in fact information regarding the structure of the cosmos, that when understood could allow one to derive an abundance of energy from the vacuum.</p>

<p>Now when we look at Haramein&#39;s work, we see that this is indeed what is postulated from his theory. From his work, we find that the universe is indeed interconnected and at any point, there is the entire information of the universe encoded. From this it becomes possible to derive more information both about the micro and macro worlds, similar to the saying &quot;as above, so below&quot;. This theory also posits the presence of wormholes through the fabric of space that it is possible to travel through and drastically reduce the travel time for interplanetary, interstellar or even intergalactic travel.</p>

<p>I can add more if you&#39;re interested, or if this is falling on deaf ears I might just stop here to not waste my time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking about science versus technology.  Most people would be surprised at any extant ability to manipulate gravity--not because the technology hasn&#39;t been invented, but because the technology is inconceivable due to a lack of scientific understanding.  You&#39;re presupposing that they&#39;ve researched and mastered an entirely novel branch of physics completely in secret for decades.  Nothing that occurred in the mid-20th century and now-declassified comes close to that kind of revelation.</p>
