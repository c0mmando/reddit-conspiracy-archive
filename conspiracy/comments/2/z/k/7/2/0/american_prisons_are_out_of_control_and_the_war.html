        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most people in jail are half way decent and will never get the help they truly need. Especially in the USA, where we jail more people than any other country on earth.  I think that’s one reason why we have the levels of crime we have. We turn everybody into felons with nothing left to survive on but crime and we throw people in prison that have mental illness or drug problems and they never ever get help they need and just become another part of the prison system. Since the war on drugs we&#39;ve increased the populations of our prisons by over 700%. The U.S. has 5 percent of the world&#39;s population but 25 percent of the world&#39;s prison population. There have been more than 40 million arrests for drug-related offenses in the past forty years!! And nearly 10 percent of US prisons and jails are private, dominated by two major firms — Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and GEO Group. It&#39;s become profitable for private companies to cage people! That&#39;s just wrong! I say we make a harder stand against privatizing prisons and throw the war on drugs out the window and start helping people rather than throwing them away in cages. I could go on and on but you get my point. </p>

<p>Now, think about where the unprocessed cocaine from Coca-Cola goes... And why we still have troops guarding poppy fields in Afghanistan... Crack is whack, yes, but heroin KILLS. Big Pharma&#39;s making a lotta $$$, but who knows what the CIA profits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our government and all related authorities are hopelessly infected by the paper money mafia, bying up all for nothing. Until we organize a major nationwide strike, nothing will happen.</p>

<p>Democrats and Republicans might be biggering, but since the money behind them bought the WHOLE congress long time ago, it&#39;s just a charade.</p>

<p>A nationwide strike to end private banking is probably the only hope for organizers. The rest of us will try not to feed the evil meanwhile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.   Not all lost jobs are going overseas via outsourcing.   A lot of them have gone to prisoners in what I call insourcing.</p>

<p>Check out California Corrections Product catalog on Google, or Juniper Valley Products.   Those are just two examples.   Having inmates produce goods is big business.   Furthermore, many government institutions are mandated that they must buy a % of their goods from such sources...</p>

<p>So if you can imprison non-violent offenders, and turn them into slave labor an make a hefty profit then the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; appears to be a good thing.  </p>

<p>Picking boogeyman targets for war has been very profitable and allows control and power expansion.   Drugs is one, and the War on Terror is another.   We declared war on a concept!!!!???!?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>corporate prisons &quot;were&quot; considered the next wave, but the <em>future</em> is NOW, why weren&#39;t we paying attention; maybe because nobody WE knew was in the system,</p>

<p>the US has more people in prison than any other country,</p>

<p>&quot;. . . THE United States not only incarcerates a lot of people, it also has a bewildering array of places to put them. There are, of course, jails and prisons: jails are usually run by local jurisdictions (cities or counties) and house either convicted criminals serving short sentences or people awaiting trial. Prisons, or penitentiaries, are run by states or the federal government, and house convicts serving longer sentences. But there are also juvenile-detention facilities, military prisons, immigration-detention and civil-commitment centres (used for court-ordered treatment of the mentally ill; they can be inpatient or outpatient) as well as jails and prisons in Indian and overseas territories, most of which are administered by different government entities. This keeps data on the overall size of America&#39;s incarcerated population, as well as information about their crimes, quite fragmented.</p>

<p>. . .But it also underscores something we&#39;ve written about before: <strong>America locks up too many people for too many things.</strong> The number of federal laws has risen from 3,000 in the early 1980s to over 4,450 by 2008. Many of these have poor intent requirements, meaning <em>people are being locked up not to keep the rest of society safe, but for technical violations of laws they may not have known existed</em>. This overreliance on imprisonment can be seen most starkly, and sadly, by looking at the juvenile population, which is just under 71,000 nationally. </p>

<p>Around 11,600 are imprisoned for &quot;technical violations&quot; of their probation or parole terms, rather than because they committed a new crime. In 11 states such juvenile prisoners outnumber those in for crimes against other people. In only one state (Massachusetts) did juveniles imprisoned for crimes committed against people comprise a majority of juvenile prisoners.<br/>
<em>Around 3,000 are locked up for things that aren&#39;t crimes for adults</em>, &quot;such as running away, truancy and incorrigibility.&quot; Incarcerated children are less likely to graduate high-school and more likely to spend time in prison as adults. If America is interested in reducing its prison population, locking up fewer juveniles for silly reasons would be a good place to start.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have built the system around incacerating drug users to the point that they do not believe they can reverse the process.</p>

<p>If they put money into rehabiltation programs we would need a war on drugs. </p>

<p>The problem is the conservatives. They didn&#39;t even want to pay for crazy people so they shut down insane asylums and let those people out on to the streets to muder rape and steal. Then they locked them up.</p>

<p>The system currently is so screwed up because you put decent people in with really crazy and really evil people and expect them not to be corrupted or mentally tortured.</p>

<p>Conservatives believe that your drug problem, is a problem and you should be locked away. Fuck helping you, fuck that, that costs money, locking someone up however, doesn&#39;t seem to be a cost of burden to them. </p>

<p>Fucking liberals make it worse by giving easy sentences to really evil people and expect them to just sort it out in prison and they&#39;ll come out all better.</p>

<p>The one thing Democrats were doing right was keeping the insane asylums in place and they lost that battle and succumbed to the prison complex system and the drug war.</p>
