<p>And a little empathy or sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust would help you to see through the Nazi propaganda you just posted. I sympathize with those individuals who were forced to be complicit in the crimes that occurred in Nazi Germany. I have little empathy for those who willingly took part. I also have little sympathy for those who, after the obscene amount of history data available that contributes to the historical record, choose to deny it.</p>

<p>You just linked to CODOH for fuck&#39;s sake. If these are you sources, you are barely qualified to define the term history, let alone claim to understand it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with CODOH -- all they do is host various people&#39;s research, and have a discussion forum.

<p>Yes they did.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the historical record shows different.</p>

<p>Not if you want to deny the holocaust. But for regular people, there is a lot wrong with it.</p>

<p>All those various people happen to holocaust deniers and everyone on the forum happens to be, at the very least, a holocaust denier.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re afraid of going near information which might challenge your religious beliefs about the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Yep, that is totally it. I am afraid of it. It couldn&#39;t possibly be that there are thousands of corresponding primary sources, including plans, testimony (from victims and perpetrators), physical evidence supporting the academic historical consensus. </p>

<blockquote>

Luckily I read that first, wouldn&#39;t want to buy and books and hand those assholes real money. Have you ever bothered to look up the historical data?

So unless every historian (or at least every one without a swastika on their wall) is part of some Jewish plot, you have way more to overcome than just my opinion.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you go out in public and speak your views. Go speak to some survivors. Go speak to some historians. Go put yourself out there and see how long your views last when you have to look into the eyes of those you smear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take this tone because I already know what you are. I&#39;ve seen you here, day in and day out, constantly spewing your hateful cause. I could pretend to humor your obvious lack of intellectual capability but considering what you represent, I see no need. Your &quot;history is written by the victors&quot; shit holds less and less relevance in the global and civilized world. The academic community, the ability to record with photos and video, the high profile trials in which Nazi&#39;s themselves testified to their own crimes, they come together to create a history that no one can whitewash. We know about Allied crimes as well, and we look down on those as we should. There is no excuse for the internment of the Japanese, or various other violations of human rights that occurred in those dark times. That platitude is nothing more than a crutch to stand upon while you spout your unsubstantiated claims. </p>

<p>You defend those who killed millions in the face of a tidal wave of evidence (I know you think it doesn&#39;t exist). I&#39;m not sorry if my anger at people like you show. I think more people should express their disgust at those who think like you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know nothing about me, champ. Nothing I have said is hateful -- <em>please</em> quote me, if you believe otherwise. Holocaust historiography is uniquely protected by anti free-speech laws, and through these aggressive, medieval attitudes you display here. By making dissent illegal and socially unacceptable, the historiography -- already based on wartime propaganda -- has become increasingly chauvinistic and retarded (not to mention intertwined with the dogma of irrational Jewish cults.) Revisionism is a natural response to an unnatural situation. [typo]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes, you are obviously very careful to keep your personal views secret. It helps you maintain the illusion of legitimacy. It is easier to recruit that way. But anyone who knows anything about actual history knows what your motivations are. No one denies the holocaust because they are interested in historical accuracy. </p>

<p>I know you think everyone who disagrees with you just hasn&#39;t seen the evidence (including nearly every world war 2 historian apparently) , but the truth is that you are just wrong. </p>

<p>Do I agree with anti-hate legislation? No. I prefer to deal with those who hold these despicable views by rejecting them as a society. Push them to the fringes by letting others know just how morally and intellectually bankrupt the cause is, and hopefully your numbers will continue to dwindle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, [US]$19.36 on the link through his website, so looks like only about $1.50 cheaper.  Cost me [US]$26 when it came out.</p>

<p>Totally worth it though.  Dahmer, Bundy, Ramirez, Lucas et al.  Incidentally, when police found a naked and incoherently terrified (I think) 14 year old in Milwaukee, their response was to return him to Dahmer&#39;s apartment against his will, saying that they thought it was a lover&#39;s argument (?!?!).  &quot;... when one of the trio [of women who called the police] attempted to indicate to one of the officers that Sinthasomphone was bleeding from his buttocks and that he had seemingly struggled against Dahmer&#39;s attempts to walk him to his apartment, the officer harshly informed her to &quot;butt out,&quot;[124] &quot;shut the hell up&quot;[125] and to not interfere, adding the incident was &quot;domestic.&quot;  While there, they barely noticed the stench of the dead body decaying in the bedroom which they did not see despite one officer who &quot;peeked his head around the bedroom but really didn&#39;t take a good look.&quot;  This is the official version of things.  Not fishy at all...</p>

<p>Henry Lee Lucas and his partner Otis Toole left Mexico, where there is no capital punishment and surrendered themselves in separate states.  Those states?  Texas and Florida.  The governors of those states at the time?  George and Jeb Bush.  The execution-happy G.W. didn&#39;t just grant a stay of execution for appeals, but <em>commuted</em> the sentence to life in prison meaning he would never face execution.  A guard at the facility commented that for some reason he received special privileges until his death there.  Lucas also claimed to have trained US backed paramilitary death squads in the use of knives.</p>

<p>Toole&#39;s death sentence was also commuted to life in prison.  He later confessed to killing the son of America&#39;s Most Wanted host John Walsh.  This is straight from his wiki (emphasis mine):</p>

<p>Twenty-seven years after the 1981 murder of Adam Walsh, authorities officially named Toole as the likely killer.[9][13]</p>

<p>Toole claimed to have picked Walsh up in a Sears mall parking lot. Toole said he offered him candy and toys and that Walsh came willingly. Walsh soon wanted to go home and began crying. Toole said he then punched him in the face. Walsh started crying more, and according to Toole, he began to &quot;wallop&quot; Walsh, knocking him out. Toole eventually pulled over in a rural area and decapitated Walsh with a machete. He drove around for several days with Walsh&#39;s head, forgot about it, and once rediscovering it, tossed it into a nearby canal. <strong>Police somehow lost his impounded car and machete, hindering their ability to proceed with the investigation.</strong></p>

<p>These kinds of revelations are pretty routine throughout the book.</p>

<p>For a preview, <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/henry.html">here&#39;s</a> an old piece McGowan did on Lucas.</p>

<p>Also, the DC sniper thing was unfolding as this book was being published, but you can read his newsletters on that case at his site (davesweb.cnchost.com).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the big picture, I can&#39;t recommend this book highly enough: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-History-World-Laid-Societies/dp/1590200314/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;sr=&amp;amp;qid=">The Secret History of the World, as laid down by the Secret Societies</a>.</p>

<p>I also recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fish-That-Ate-Whale-Americas-ebook/dp/B0071VOLN8/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1426755657&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=fish+that+ate+the+whale">The Fish that Ate the Whale</a>.  It&#39;s a biography of a man named Sam Zemurray, who ran one of the largest corporations in the world and personally instigated at least 3 south american coups, who personally guaranteed the establishment of the state of Israel.  This is a great background on how things actually work; sometimes it&#39;s not as grand a conspiracy as you might think-- it might just be someone with a whole lot of money to be made.</p>
