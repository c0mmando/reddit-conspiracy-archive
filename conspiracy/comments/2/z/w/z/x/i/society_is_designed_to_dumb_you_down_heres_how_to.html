       Stress makes you dumbed down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is designed to keep you egotistical attached with duality, ie, there us and then there's them. Its designed to enforce the identity society tries to give us. So when they successfully get you egotistically attached to one side of a war, it then constantly works your emotions to get desired psychological responses, which turn into behavioral responses. 
After 9/11, disinformation agents posed as war veterans and retired political officials went onto the news, got the majority of people to egotistically attach to our side of the war, and then proceeded to manipulate the emotions of the US  population to get them to believe weapons of mass destruction were in Iraq. Once in Iraq, the fear they instilled in America allowed the military to make advances on other countries that weren't banking with the Rothschilds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Music and movies, whether intentional or not, are designed the same way. Django unchained is a great example. They get you to sympathize with Django, a slave who is granted his freedom by a bounty hunter. The bounty hunter enables Django to seek out revenge, and through our sympathy with Django, and the demonization of his enemies, we start to delight in the violence enacted on Djangos enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that causes stress makes you dumbed down, the greatest source of stress being thought. We think ourselves into negative self images, we think ourselves into limitation, we think ourselves into stupidity and drama. The way out of the crazy haze, is to stop thinking, stop reacting, reach an equanimity of mind. At that point, you cannot be manipulated by anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It requires the renouncing of our egotistical attachment to duality, to come out of the crazy haze of the insanity caused by the propagation of an enemy. It requires a renouncing of being emotionally influenced and controlled by external sources, to find the sanity enough to realize the insanity in others. It takes wisdom, humility, and nobility to be able to rise out of the insanity without being tainted by arrogance, anger, or judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the true enlightenment, and if we were to bring an end to conspiracy fueled politics, it will only be made possible by a mass enlightenment, where we all come out of insanity. And so our proclamation, if we are for peace and the end of political manipulation, is that we should bring ourselves out of insanity and become beacons of sanity, compassion, wisdom, peace and enlightenment. Trying to end a fight with screaming and fighting makes a bigger fight, ending a fight with understanding, empathy, and compassion is the only way.

       Exercise, get out into nature everyday if possible, no tv, no mainstream music or movies, avoid all advertisements, eat properly, read history to understand what's happening in the world and why, read the classics of analytic philosophy to learn how to think clearly, meditate, introspect, research, and develop your own approach towards spirituality, and do LSD, DMT, or psilocybin at least a few times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: a mass enlightenment is necessary, and this is the way to win back your mind, but ultimately, action is also necessary.  There is an elite criminal class that owns the monetray system, all major governments and governmental institutions, all major industries, and the entire mainstream media apparatus.  These people need to be dealt with.  Peace and love are good things to cultivate within yourself and your community, but unfortunately, harsh action is also necessary considering the situation of the world.  The global elite will not just disappear if everyone wakes up, they need to be removed.  The sutras say that even the Buddha killed a man when it was the right thing to do.

       Yeah.  This stuff is daunting if you think about it all at once, but really, there are small easy changes you can make in each of these areas that have a major effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exercise: Whatever your fitness level, make sure to be active frequently.  If you don't play any sports, do some kind of cardio focused exercise, and some kind of strength focused exercise.  I love running, especially because it's an excuse to go to the woods which has a strong positive influence on my outlook and mental clarity, but I understand why some people hate running.  Even brisk walking is very good for you compared to complete inactivity. Walking is not a cop out, especially if you are very out of shape.  Brisk walking for just 30 minutes a day has been shown to have all kinds of physical and mental benefits.   You don't need gear or a gym membership to start exercising.

        Things like the routines on this channel are a very hard workout

      </p>
      <p>
       Diet: doesn't have to be immaculate, just stop eating processed foods, stop eating preservatives, artificial colors and flavors, and "natural flavors".  If you're addicted to various processed foods (I certainly have been in the past) this is a bit tough at first but if you do it for a week with exercise as well, you will stop craving bad stuff in the same way.  You can also help yourself with natural treats like chocolate.   Try to eat more fruit and veg.  This doesn't have to be expensive, just buy a head of lettuce, some carrots, and whatever kind of fruit is cheapest and always have those things on hand and eat some of them with whatever meal or snack you're having.

       Non-toxic hygiene products:  switch out your toothpaste, deoderant, soap, shampoo, makeup, etc., for versions made from simple plant based ingredients.  This is not just hippy bullshit.  General inflammation and overload of the body's detoxification systems are major areas of current health research and are implicated in leading to all kinds of chronic conditions from cancers, to dimentia, to thyroid and metabolic problems, to testosterone deficiency and xenoestrogen build up.  I've found that Tom's of Maine toothpaste and deoderant work fine.  It's fairly easy to find a pine tar soap or some other kind of soap that's made from simple plant ingredients.  Don't use any products of any kind with artificial fragrances.

        This is a very good introduction to a couple meditation practices
       </a>
       .  Meditation is harder, by far, than all of the other things on the list.  Don't feel bad that you can't even do it for more than 3 seconds at first.  Just keep trying at your own pace and don't get burnt out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting a real handle on analytic philosophy is a long project, but if you want to understand the core of the tradition's approach to thinking, read the Crito by Plato (and the other dialogues dealing with Socrates), and the Meditations by Descartes.  For an example of clear thinking in modern language, Searle's argument in the Chinese Room paper is well put together and easy to understand.  If you're some kind of transhumanist you won't like the conclusion, but the point is to get accustomed to what clear, non-manipulative, argument reads/sounds like so you can start to identify when you or someone you're talking to is deviating from honest, straightforward discourse.

       Look into WWI and WWII enough and you will start to understand the larger motivations behind the ostensibly chaotic mess of current geopolitics.

       The most important thing you can do to start developing a spiritual sense about the world (this is vitally important, the vacuous pointlessness of naive scientistic physicalism is the primary cause of the epidemic of political, social, and personal apathy in all developed nations) is to be honest all the time.  Be honest with yourself about what you think and what you're feeling.  Be honest when speaking to others.  Realize that "feelings" comprise more than half of your experience of the world.  The dichotomy "thinking/feeling" paints an inaccurate picture of the world of human experience.  Realize how utterly mysterious every aspect of "feeling" is.  Be honest about what you're feeling at all times and pay attention, in detail, to what you are feeling.  If you do this in combination with the other things listed here, you will naturally begin to develop your own understanding of your spiritual nature and the spiritual nature of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find psychedelics.  You have at least one friend who smokes weed and he knows someone who knows where to get these things.  Find a way to do psychedelics in a safe, outdoor, private, setting with people you absolutely trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: lastly, entertainment: do not watch tv, but if you need video entertainment (I do) seek out content that is artistically, intellectually, rich.

       I love this. As an important addendum spend as much time as possible in nature! I think fresh air and the natural world are overlooked as a natural de-stresser and a great way to get exercise without being bored on a treadmill. As well as a great creative muse!

       Alright so I've done both acid and shrooms several times, and never really felt all that stuff about spiritual and they didn't really make me rethink my life to be honest. I just spent quite a while being generally munted. They're fun, but going into them thinking that you'll come out a different person isn't necessarily accurate, and could ruin your experience. If you want to do them, cool, they're generally pretty harmless and fun. However, they can be scary if you end up in the wrong mindset, and they're definitely not a "must do" if you want to improve yourself.

       I see what you mean, but I disagree with this statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go into psychedelics with just a recreational mindset, then you will have an awesome and enjoyable time, filled with crazy visuals and hysterical fits of laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you go into them with the mindset of using them as a tool to better understand yourself and life as a whole, then you can have some seriously life changing realizations. It's all about how you go into your trip that determines the type of trip you will have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think that they are a "must do" for everyone at least once in their life. But they must be used properly and respected for their power.

       It's not exactly a clear cut definition, but stuff like Bertrand Russell might be a good starting point. The

       The ancient Greeks, Descartes, Kant, Hume, Mills, Leibnitz, Russel, Wittgenstein (Wittgenstein's output is often split into "early" and "later".  Early Wittgenstein, especially the Tractatus is considered analytic canon by most people.  His later work is no less profound but his style becomes much more mystical and artistic and less academic) Quine, Carnap, Sellars (maybe not according to some people but I think he was basically the capstone on the entire project of epistemology), Kripki, Putnam, Searle (if you ask me), Lewis, and lots of others I'm forgetting.  I mostly care about epistemology so most of these people were important in the history of that area.

       I dont understand the endorcment of drug use on this sub lately. I am not vilanising you because I have done them before, but I can tell you from experience that its not good advise. Some people it will fuck them up for life.
      </p>
      <p>
       You speak later of detoxification and I don't see how you can say that when you suggest someone try acid. Its not natural in any way save the morning glory seeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shrooms maybe but you wanna trust some guy that went and picked them in a field? Yes I was that guy that went and got my own. Made sure I knew what I was looking for and found it.
      </p>
      <p>
       DMT is another man made designer drug. Its not good for you body and it isn't natural.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to be happier or whatever. Do as op says and just let go man. Fuck society let your moral compass guide you in life. If you are a bad person then you will get yours in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't need drugs to gain enlightenment. You can do it on your own it just requires you to say fuck all that trys to sway your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit... People that say they did drugs for anything other then to get fucked up are bull shitters that are trying to gain influence plain and simple. You wanna get fucked up then do it. Be responsible about it, but don't act like its something special.

       I'm sorry but it's totally apparent that you have no idea what you're talking about.  DMT is endogenously produced in the human brain.  It's as "natural" as serotonin or your fingernail.  It is endogenously produced in a huge variety of plants and animals.  As the plant brew ayahuasca, scholars believe it has been used for at least two thousand years in the shamanic traditions of the Amazon.  If you have links to studies showing that it's "not good for your body" please post them.

       Fuck you.  You're disrespecting the traditions and life philosophies of many of the greatest societies and spiritual systems in the history of the human race, and many of the greatest creative, scientific, and technological geniuses of the modern world.  Were the Eleusinian Mysteries just where Plato and Socrates went to "get fucked up"?  Was ancient Greek intellectual culture, the culture that built the foundations of the modern world and shaped all of Western thought for millennia up to the present day, the culture that inspired the renaissance and lifted the world out of the dark ages, "just bullshitters" because they believed these rites were a profound source of knowledge and a vital part of becoming an adult?  Was Francis Crick "just bullshiting" when he theorized the double helix structure of DNA while "fucked up" on LSD?

       LSD is a substance you take in ~50 microgram doses a few times in your life.  Comparing LSD use to chronic, daily exposure to large amounts of known carcinogens, immunosuppresives, and endocrine disruptors is completely ridiculous.

       The answer is 0 reported cases. So where are you getting your "shit can kill you" information? Most if not all reports stating that LSD can kill you is typical smear campaign propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow-up question... have YOU personally every tried psychedelics? How could you possibly render a valid opinion about whether or not they can be used for enlightenment or spiritual awakening?

       The first time, sure. Absolutely. Like I said earlier, the mindset you have going into it is completely relevant to the type of trip you intend to have.

       You really need to watch this video. Please do, and then let us know your reaction. This was what made me look at psychedelics in a completely new light. Not as a form of recreation, but a tool for consciousness.

       This attitude is idiotic and incredibly arrogant and offensive.  Seriously fuck you.  Millions of humans have used psycedelics for aeons of human history and found them to be extremely profound gateways to spiritual experience.  Nearly all the worlds religions originated in pagan visionary cults.  You sound like an incredibly shallow person who can't conceive that other people might actually live more rich and profound lives than yours.  Fuck off.

       Just because a few persons in history you believe were on drugs but haven't witnessed yourself means nothing. You won't convince me otherwise and furthermore its childish to attempt to try and do so with others.

       Yeah LSD was just to fuck you up. Plain and simple. So he did something good. So some others did too. A vast majority will not do something profound.
      </p>
      <p>
       LSD isn't good for you most times it is cut with arsnic or something worse. As a normal user you won't know so its a risk.

       I'm sorry but those are not sentences of English.  I don't know what to say.   The Elusinian Mystery cult that I explained to you in my previous post was based around the use of an ergot derived substance theorized to be an LSD precursor.  Some of the greatest minds in the history of the western world considered these LSD rituals the defining point in their lives.  You apparently think you are more enlightened and wiser than these sages of humanity.  You are arrogant and naive.

       LOL.  Reefer Madness style hysteria.  Complete bullshit.  Even if this total lie was true, there are simple test kits you can buy now to identify chemicals on blotter.  There are also sites like Silk Road (and it's successors) where you are guaranteed to get high quality, very pure products because any seller who delivers a substandard product will immediately have their reputation ruined and will be unable to sell anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're just pumping out a bunch of nonsense, paranoid lies, and incredibly arrogant judgmental bullshit.  Grow up.  Humans have been using psychedelics for spiritual seeking since we came into our modern biological form.  When you say that these substances are just for getting "fucked up" and that anyone who tells you otherwise is lying and trying to manipulate you, you are insulting the greatest minds and cultures and spiritual traditions in the history of the human race.

       I've explained to you, at length, how many of the greatest minds and cultures and spiritual traditions in the history of humanity have considered the use of psychedelics an incredibly powerful spiritual experience that defined them as the people they were and inspired their grandest ideas.

       I am saying that isn't the norm. You make it sound as if you will become a new person by doing some substance.

       I find your condescending tone that of an adolescent and not at all enlightened. You are most likely stuck in a phase where you think you have a purpose that is grand.
      </p>
      <p>
       You very may well have a purpose. Trying to convince others here isn't that purpose. I have done various drugs. They did nothing for me spiritual in nature that I was not able to achieve more so sober.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are trying to justify drug use and its childish. You want to vilify me cause I won't agree with you and you can feel you have the moral high ground because you can't understand that same things are better to experience sober.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides how do you know these facts? Were you there or did you read it in a book? You want to control the conversation with insults. How can you say you are a better person?

       Natural to me means you don't have any refining methods. Like weed its a plant great or coca leaves to chew on. That's fine in my eyes. But things that require a form of refinement are wrong to me.

       Even opium plants or peyote. Them is fine too. Cause its natural. I get sick of people that say oh I became one with the world cause I did xxxxx drugs wow.

       Great post. I totally agree. When a culture gets to a point where you have to take a side on everything, where you can never say "I don't know", where no amount of cognitive dissonance is tolerated, then that is a culture of pure control.
People can look at enlightenment as this airy fairy spiritual thing, but at the end of the day it is really a very political process. Waking up to one's place in the world is highly political. Gaining some measure of control over one's own thoughts is as political as it gets. Buddhism offers some very useful techniques to learn how to control the ego, but it is far  from the only way. 
Ultimately, spiritual or political awakening take a lot of work and endurance. No set of dogmas will do it, and there is no one way to get there.

       Politics is pragmatism. Nothing can ever be changed, just tweaked slightly based on the current tide. Everything is hopelessly dependent on an overwhelming tide of contingencies. Progress will always be hampered by rhetoric and excuses. This is why bureaucracies always grow and never get smaller. This is how governments always get more power and never give it up. Everything is based on what happened yesterday and what we will do about it today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enlightenment is idealism. Everything can be changed. If something doesn't work, you must break it down to its root cause, and do everything to eliminate it. There is no fear in doing a complete reversal if that is what is necessary. Everything is based on what is happening right now and what we will improve to make a better tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority will always have you accept pragmatism and reject idealism. It keeps them in power and makes everyone feel helpless to change it.

       "Enlightenment is idealism." I disagree with this. Enlightenment is a real thing, not an imagined thing, not something that you will into being. It's something that's already there inside of each person, not an ideal to be reached. It's our humanity, our spirit. It's the very essence of pragmatism, but not the bullshit pragmatism of mass manipulators and psycho controllers. It's the pragmatism of knowing who you are and realizing that anything that subtracts from who you really are is a fiction.

       Well said.

      <p>
       I might have abused the terms "pragmatism" and "idealism." I meant them more as states of mind or modes of thinking rather than how realistically attainable they are.

       I'm definitely not a philosopher, but I enjoy thinking.

       And smoking weed and doing mushrooms helps believe it or not. Smoking weed definitely makes you more aware of how out of place everything is. Commercial seem extra fake , petty drama and bad habits  seem useless.  With extra awareness and a different perspective marijuana is a great tool for "waking up"

       Haha no I cant. Honestly its a mixed bag and personally have no one to share this mentality with so its a bit isolating.
      </p>
      <p>
       it breaks a lot of social conditioning.  For me its better just cause I know for sure I'm not being distracted it puts a certainty in your life that wasn't there before.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you deal with fake people and brainwashed parts of society its unbearable. But when you have genuine moments of love they feel much stronger, your able to appreciate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possessions have lost meaning to me, death of ego happens. Fear of dying doesn't exist anymore. Just some short ramblings of mine. I have other beliefs about shrooms as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just know that there's something special about reality then you feel sad about all the parts that arent real. If that makes sense

       I have never had a good experience with shrooms, or salvia, salvia is worthless in my opinion. 
Dmt is where it's at, but make sure you have a peaceful, joyful mind before doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All dmt is going to show you is what you fail to recognize within yourself already. Your spirit and mind yearn for bliss and joy, those things that keep you from bliss will manifest themselves in your trip. If you manage to get past all the spiritual distractions, you can experience ego loss, the greatest experience I have ever experienced, an experience readily available in every waking moment of our lifes.

       Agree on your description, but it also points to more of an actual NEED to go to Salvia land.  If you're going to live in the deep amazon forest one day, try to visit at least the louisiana bayou for experience.

       You know what shrooms does for a greater majority of users? It gives you hallucinations. You don't see something special you see what your mind wants you too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed is good for medical uses. I am for it when it helps people in a broad sence but just cause you can in some places don't mean you should. Got plenty of people I know that have legitimate reasons to do it. Seen it work for them too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its great I think. I love extacy but I would never endorse its use. I would explain what it did to me. Let them make up their own minds, but I would explain the bad things too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people out there it ain't for them and when you just show it in a good light its a form of control. Seen a guy drop acid and he used a cheese grater to scrape his skin off. Laughing the whole fucking time.
      </p>

       Then I seen people do it and be able to ace a goddamn phisics final in college.

       It's pretty apparent you have no idea what you're talking about. If there is any truth to that statement, you should revise the word majority to minority. The huge majority of people I have talked to about shrooms describe it as one of the best experiences of their lives.

       Can confirm: Went way to far down the McKenna rabbit hole. And then the self-mutating machine elves jumped through my chest giving me knowledge to questions I didn't ask nor had i never even thought about and they just laughed the whole time. Was enlightening. Granted, that's DMT, but similar stories happen with mushrooms and a whole variety of other plants that affect us this way FOR A REASON.

       Don't you find it a little odd that hallucination happens at all? What evolutionary/symbiotic purpose do you suppose that serves? Think about catnip and how it's not fair that the dog doesn't get to get messed up too unless you feed it some pot but weed and feeding weed to dogs is illegal so it's not fair. Cats are our overlords.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say, hallucinogens do not just take where you mind wants to go. Pulls things out of your subconscious from time to time, sure, but you don't get to direct it (I mean, you caaan but rarely rarely.)

       It is by your thoughts that you condition yourself into complacency, into egotism, and into affliction, these things keep you demoralized. The remedy to the conditioning society puts on us is through thoughtlessness, only then will the filters of emotion and subjectivity be removed, allowing us to see life as it truly is, allowing us to make clear cut decisions to dismantling the control the Rothschilds, the elite, and the corrupt politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       This message is misleading, but still truthful, we have to take a step back from insanity in order to be sane, so yes we have to practice a good degree of inaction and thoughtlessness to do so. But as with everything in life, it takes a balance act between action and introspection in order to be the most effective.

       Thinking keeps you from operating on higher levels of consciousness, levels that are more intelligent, and more capable of integrating new information.

       The original poster highlights 'black and white thinking;' as we're programmed to 'react' whenever someone says a 'buzzword' which we are 'groomed' to think makes them a bad person and so we throw the baby out with the bath-water. {Even if they've made a great contribution to our lives, as with Mel Gibson.}
      </p>
      <p>
       I share your concerns; which are the end-result of the machination of a hypercompetitive hair-brained-bunch of people with no 'meaning' to their life; and those agents have evil intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which ranges from the internet troll to the larger scale also; who get-off on believing they can con-troll our perception of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       As 'they mistake' you affording; the trouble-making, ruinous, pathologically-lying would-be bullies; an adult level of respect, for you mistaking them as being 'arbiter of reality.' {Which they crave, to ameliorate against what they've become.}
      </p>
      <p>
       If you use the internet trolls as a dead-give-away of the higher-perched mind-con-troll freaks; you notice that if they can't con you into their practiced dynamic; where the ambition is ideally for you to 'choose' to become angry, to a panting-paraphiliac you may not be able to pick-out of a line-up of 2, nor they you; 'then' either-way they run-tell-mummy and the 'rule' book comes out, to declare you as being what they are and the 'awful truth' is then banned
       <em>
        !
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no-one more trolled than Erol; because he reveals 'every' top-secret we're supposed to be in the dark about; until 'after' we're dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we attract all trolls; especially since Erol 'deconstructs' and exposes them and their solitary bag of tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people don't realise that most trolls are core-inadequate jerks; who work for free and are 'cerebral' sex-offenders. Who troll; looking for 'human' brains; searching for 1 who isn't yet emotionally-independent and who'll grant the lying beast the time of day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because; the average person hasn't studied neuro-anatomy, neuro-pathology, neuro-chemistry, narcissistic-or megalomaniacal psychopathy; they 'struggle' to realise what a cerebral sex-offender is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor will they realise the magical-thinker's obsession; is of the 'unwitting admission' of unconscious true-self-loathing, I.e. Via the self-destructive delusion of 'transference;' because of the 'rage' issues which the hollow-vessel suffers from, due to their 'extreme-self-delusion' and existential-envy of adult 'moral;' ergo honest and considerate; human beings
       <em>
        !
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       In brief; they get-off on decreeing themselves 'winner' of imaginary competitions and any negative-reaction allows the weak asshole to trigger a supply of 'dopamine' and ideally serotonin and better-still a 'rush;' if the evil-dunce believes they've produced an outcome which 'shouldn't' be the case; in other words, the forum turns-against the good guy, in favour of the morally-vacant, hate-consumed, troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or better still it leaves someone fuming in their wake and; as is far lesser-known; they target the same person again and again and again and again and again, 'deliberately' trying to cause them P.T.S.D., whilst priding themselves on covertly getting their supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atypically; even-though the troll is the pathologically-ingrained and neuro-anatomical construct of egomania, if you don't laugh 'flatteringly' at the sex-offender, they'll 'decree' you as being what they are and then pretend you "deserve it, have it coming, brought it on yourself and were asking for it." {Which allows them to juice-up their ventral-tegmental reward centre. Like Jack Pallance in 'Shane.'}
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'paid' trolls are no-different, they are 'armed' with Zionist buzzwords, E.g. If you look at their history, you'll see they regularly ask complete strangers, "Are you anti-semitic ?" or "Are you homophobic ?" or "Are you a misogynist ?" or "Are you fill in the blank, fill in the blank?"
      </p>
      <p>
       They get-off on the human having 'prefrontal' brain-function and atypically will plead their innocence or at least defend it, to a complete stranger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which allows the low-life troll to believe it's important and superior. Which 'also' allows the government-plants to delight in their plodding 'solitary' trick too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, there are a percentage who are simply kids; being unruly; those who aren't sex-offenders; who act as trolls, have 'no life.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, they're so petty and puerile they press the down-arrow and 'care' about Karma, which even reddit states is 'meaningless.' But the fool doesn't care about Karma, which takes it's 'toll' on them, for their evil and dishonesty and especially on those who are part of the genocidal agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I repeat; they hope to 'con' you into thinking they're the 'arbiter of reality' and over 90% of their trick is dramatising 'any' tiny-point, their bird-brain often pre-believes will 'win.' By either saying or; even-more impotently; wish-typing, 'You are what I am.' {When you think it through.}
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just 1 of Erol's ground-breaking studies on them; he's renowned for having studied serial-killers and paedophiles and other pathologically-lying, magical-thinking, emotional-manipulators, in the field. All of whom were self-confessed sex-offenders, I.e. 'paraphiliacs.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Erol reveals top secrets about their psychology and rechristened them 'Neandertrolls,' due to his remarkably ground-breaking neuro-anatomical discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus; more humorously; he refers to them as being 'unitards,' as they have 'ingrained' a solitary pathology; due to their solitary addiction to winning their supply; which over-time becomes rigid, thus the term 'hardened' criminal. Keep up the 'good' work.
      </p>
      <p>

        http://erolon.blogspot.pt/2015/02/trolls-are-hair-brained-sex-offenders.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. Spread the word, before the panting-paraphiliacs 'run tell mummy,' that there's a human they can't con-troll; to delude themselves they're awake whilst you're asleep; comically and tragically, in 'both' cases, being 'genocided' by the Ashkenazi tribe; of imaginary-Satan-worshipping, fake-jews; {I.e. Euro-trash with a Neanderthal amygdala and predominately only 6% of a human=brain's function.} They're clones who peddle their pity-play, a.k.a. known as the 'holohoax.'
      </p>
      <p>
       p.p.s. E.g. Even if everyone on reddit; which Erol calls, 'The mosque of the lie,' since Aaron Swartz was assasinated; were to wish-type, 'You are what I am,' simply remain emotionally-independent and keep smiling, despite any number of low-life, no-life 'losers,' who want your attention and for you to mistake; the unenviable, hell-bound, self-deluded-dunce; for being important and intelligent, despite their emotional-intelligence tests showing; the-same as 'every' psychopath; that they have a 3-5 year old girls' brain and 'aren't human.'
      </p>
      <p>
       p.p.s By the time Erol's finished with them; the hair-brained delusional-dunces 'need' therapy, on top of needing therapy on top of 'needing hung.'

       Oh yeah, if you have an agenda, and you don't mind using subversive mind control, anyone can manipulate another person. It's a simple, practical thing to do, even a manager at a business can create a climate of stress and then use that stress to manipulate his employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insurance claim reps are perfect examples, the stress,put on them to deny an insurance claim becomes so high, that they become afraid of approving any insurance claim.
