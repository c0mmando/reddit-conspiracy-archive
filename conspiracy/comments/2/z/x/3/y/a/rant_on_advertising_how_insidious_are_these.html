They are done in such a way to evoke a real emotional response and your dumb as shit neurons fuse to any mention of these brands in the future. </p>

They are still marketing Coke Zero as if it&#39;s a new product, or that people are afraid to try it. They say things like &quot;Life is all about trying new things. So try Coke Zero and live life to the fullest.&quot; No thanks - I&#39;ll pass on the chemical-ridden aspertame-filled poison concoction that is Coke Zero.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is so much of this though. The Michelin ads where the the dad&#39;s daughter is shown in all these life or death situations and they sell you on the fact that if he doesn&#39;t get expensive tires he&#39;s putting her at risk. It&#39;s fucked. </p>

<p>The kfc one where the kids are all eating fucking fried chicken and talking about how their parents are pricks for not feeding this to them all the time. I mean, if a kid sees this, he&#39;s going to think he&#39;s being shafted. That&#39;s some bullshit advertising right there. It should be illegal to target kids like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say that it&#39;s possible to cut out my exposure to all ads, but by quitting cable, using ad blocker, and keeping my head down, I&#39;ve drastically reduced the amount of advertising that reaches me.

I can&#39;t make it through a full game these days, I just start feeling fucking nauseous. Consequently, I barely ever buy anything anymore besides food and books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in marketing and you are very correct in how we see consumers. The brands care about profit and keeping a consumer base that is easily identifiable. The consumer cares way more about what it says about them when they are using their product than the brand does. Marketing is executed by analyzing behavior and using that analysis to basically trick the consumer or entice the consumer to purchase. You would be surprised how much you could learn about a person&#39;s habits; even through Google Analytics! There is so much data easily available through free or priced applications on consumers, it&#39;s frightening what I can do with advertising and I don&#39;t even work for a large corporation like McDonald&#39;s or Target. They can play on your emotions because they KNOW them. It works very well. Data is power and they have a lot of data. </p>

<p>For example, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_not_to_be_wrong/2014/06/09/big_data_what_s_even_creepier_than_target_guessing_that_you_re_pregnant.html">Target</a> knows when their consumers are pregnant before they do. <strong>All of your consumer habits are tracked and analyzed and used to make you consume more.</strong> A new thing that is going on is corporations playing on the trend of organic and healthy living. People now think McDonald&#39;s is moving in a healthy direction. Coke has commercials of women jogging, I guess after they drink some Diet Coke. McDonald&#39;s knows people hate them so they release a marketing campaign allowing people to share their hate with McDonald&#39;s while ignoring the problems as to reasons why. It&#39;s all a distraction and it is a way for these brands to change their image without changing their business. It&#39;s common in marketing. During the recession, brands like Wal-Mart and Target made a lot of money. They used this money to re-brand themselves and it is working. </p>

<p>In short, every ad doesn&#39;t pretend to know you...they actually do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, there is a science to this and its accurate. The following is the basis for all sales pitches and programming.</p>

<p><strong>Pride</strong> is excessive belief in one&#39;s own abilities, that interferes with the individual&#39;s recognition of the grace of God. It has been called the sin from which all others arise. Pride is also known as Vanity.</p>

<p><strong>Envy</strong> is the desire for others&#39; traits, status, abilities, or situation.</p>

<p><strong>Gluttony</strong> is an inordinate desire to consume more than that which one requires.</p>

<p><strong>Lust</strong> is an inordinate craving for the pleasures of the body.</p>

<p><strong>Anger</strong> is manifested in the individual who spurns love and opts instead for fury. It is also known as Wrath.</p>

<p><strong>Greed</strong> is the desire for material wealth or gain, ignoring the realm of the spiritual. It is also called Avarice or Covetousness.</p>

<p><strong>Sloth</strong> is the avoidance of physical or spiritual work.</p>

<p>These are the ones used most to get inside peoples mind. You get them in emotional upheaval and then you &quot;Anchor&quot; them with the solution and they buy it.</p>

<p>99% of the population is easily worked with the correct wording, raising them to an emotional high based on one or more from the list above and then anchored with the branding or call to action. This makes it stick and gives and average of 7 return purchases on consumables for over 62% of the population. Right at 75% buy at least 3 times if the anchor is placed at the correct time and the copy is good.</p>

<p>3% (give or take a few points) turn to lifetime buyers.</p>

<p>If you have ever heard someone make a statement like (I will only buy Chevrolet, soap, beer/name other brand), they are a 3% person, they&#39;ve been psychologically anchored.</p>

<p>Almost everyone in the US has several of these hardwired into their subconscious, and it&#39;s easy to do.</p>

<p>Less than an hour of hearing a &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOEKdaXIEHc">Public service announcement</a>&quot; and the results are simply amazing/scary.</p>

<p>I do this for a living both in print and online. Although there are different styles for different media, they are all effective <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rteSvoogGv0">when you know what you are doing</a>.</p>

<p>I would advise everyone watch the videos I linked to so you know what to look for or you WILL fall for the tricks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are right. It is all a manipulation to play on your materialistic desires. Some people sadly, are defined by what they purchase and lack emotional empathy.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>ChoicePoint</strong> (previous NYSE ticker symbol CPS) was a data aggregation company based in Alpharetta, near Atlanta, Georgia, United States, that acted as a private intelligence service to government and industry.[2] It was purchased in February 2008 by Reed Elsevier (parent corporation of LexisNexis) in a cash deal for $3.6 billion USD. The company was rebranded as LexisNexis Risk Solutions.[3]</p>

<p><strong>ChoicePoint combined personal data sourced from multiple public and private databases for sale to the government and the private sector. The firm maintained more than 17 billion records of individuals and businesses, which it sold to an estimated 100,000 clients, including 7,000 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies</strong> (30 March 2005 estimates).[4]</p>
