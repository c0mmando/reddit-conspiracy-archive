<p>I had a friend who was oblivious to what was happening around him. One time he went to McDonald&#39;s to eat something out of all the shops that were around. I encouraged him to reconsider and pointed towards other hot food places. He went with McDonald&#39;s anyway and got a cheeseburger. After a short while we were talking about how I did not eat from those places and I explained how they process food. I mentioned the content of sugar in the buns, the chemicals used in the meat being unhealthy. Essentially, the food was unsatisfactory and malnourished. He then started to talk about the things he noticed that get people to buy that stuff. </p>

<p>Now he gets it. He is involved in discussions about the oil wars, imperialism and other events and topics. Of course since these are based on evidence he gained momentum and found out on his own.</p>

<p>Its often touted as the &#39;smoking gun&#39;, that proves it was an inside job. But I would say with certainty that it is the polar opposite.</p>

<p>Obviously, the goal was to set it up as a terrorist attack. But in the years of planning, why did no one stand up and say, &#39;is no one going to notice that we&#39;re demolishing a third building?&#39;. There would be months of foundation work for bringing down the building (nothing of the sort has been accounted for), millions sunk into it. All to hinge on the off chance that debris hits the building, starts a fire and then they are all systems go. So the greatest hoax of all time, hinged on chance. </p>

<p>In what world does that make sense? What do they stand to gain bringing down another building? Their job was done the minute the planes plowed into the twin towers. So is there a reasonable explaination for this? Or are the Illuminati overlords just fucking incompetant?</p>

<p>Any idea about some of the organizations/agencies/corporations that were housed within WTC7 and some of the documents that were necessarily destroyed when it came down?  Perhaps you should try looking into some of this before proclaiming there was no &quot;reasonable explanation&quot; and nothing to gain.</p>

<p>One theory is that the plane that crashed in (edit) <del>Virginia</del> PA was meant for WTC7 but, because of how important destroying this building was to the overall plans of the day, there was no choice but to bring it down anyway.</p>

<p>Regardless of that though, you don&#39;t need to have a theory to poke some gaping holes in the official story.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that they demolished a building, to destroy &#39;records&#39;?! Ha. Ahahaha. They managed to do the months of work to prepare for the demo of the building without any account for it, but getting rid of some accounts was <strong>just too hard.</strong></p>

<p>So to your account &#39;they&#39; (after years of planning) lost control of one of their planes. Two hit the buildings, but the third was just a failure. They then demolished the two towers, from the top down (which has never been tried before). Then hours after, the transformers blew in tower 7 they thought to themselves, “Fuck it, no one will notice. Blow it up anyway.&quot;</p>

With <strong>zero</strong> claims that haven&#39;t already been explained. Here&#39;s an exercise for you, because you aren&#39;t going to answer logically as to why they would level WTC7.

<p>But I&#39;ll ask one last question. Why does the collapse of the building look <em>nothing</em> like any demolishion done before?

    <div class="md"><p>If you truly think that WTC7 reached gravitational acceleration and collapsed symmetrically from office fires then there&#39;s nothing I can do to convince you otherwise, nor do I care to.  You&#39;re free to think what you want man.</p>

<p>That turd of a link you provided doesn&#39;t acknowledge gravitational acceleration once.  It also claims that debris was a factor in the collapse, directly contradicting NIST who claimed that debris was <em>not</em> a factor in the collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay to get one thing out of the way, I&#39;m not going to watch your documentary, simply no interest. If you could outline some of the points it makes I&#39;ll be happy to discuss them.</p>

<p>And its not that I&#39;m saying that things are too complicated to be true. Its that I don&#39;t accept <em>your</em> over complication. There has been no other model presented that has adequetly explained what happened that day. Its not that my reasoning is off, or I blindly trust the government, its that I there simply isn&#39;t another explaination.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll pose my question to you also.. Why was WTC7 brought down? Why would they leave it to chance that a fire would erupt in the building, to then bring it down hours afterwards. There is so much work that goes into the set up of building demolishion, none of which has been accounted for in the months/weeks leading up to it. But they decided to hedge their bets anyhow.</p>

<p>Does it not stand out to you, that you believe your government think they could convince the world that three buildings came down with two planes? <em>So much</em> rode on this, but they left a smoking gun anyhow. Does this not strike you as incompetant planning? I&#39;m sure that you&#39;re so open minded and skeptical that you will take this thought seriously and address it as such.</p>

<p>This. Is. Hilarious. You do understand that if you are to believe the official story. It is the biggest &quot;over complication&quot; of inexplicable fuckery that was ever told. Not including that fact that they still can&#39;t explain the mechanism that would have allowed the entirety of both towers to collapse completely. They literally don&#39;t even try to explain it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why was WTC7 brought down? </p>

<p>This is classic argument from incredulity, fucking google it. You are saying, &quot;If I can&#39;t understand why it happened, it didn&#39;t happen.&quot; That is a logical fallacy. Learn it, know it, and stop fucking using at as a defense. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does this not strike you as incompetant planning? </p>

<p>You are illogical. The two things are not mutually exclusive. You can have a major conspiracy plot <em>and</em> incompetant planning at the same time. The very reason that 9/11 Truth exists is because people are aware of the very glaring discrepancies that simply could not be given the official story. </p>

<p>I am done here. If you can&#39;t converse in a rational and logical fashion there is nothing to be gained from this. Goodbye. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you one example.  9/11 occurred in the midst of the Enron investigation - all or most of these records were destroyed when WTC7 came down.  The SEC can&#39;t just destroy all of its records.  Similarly, an &quot;interested third party&quot; couldn&#39;t break into the SEC offices and destroy their records without eliciting a ton of suspicion and making it obvious they did it (say all the Enron records disappeared from the building, who would you immediately suspect?).  But having the building itself destroyed in an &quot;unforeseen attack&quot; makes it all seem legit.  &quot;Wasn&#39;t our fault the building came down but what can we do now?  All the records are gone.&quot;</p>

<p>And the SEC was one of <em>many</em> such offices housed in WTC7.</p>

<p>The wreckage was exported to China before it could be looked at in any significant way, no documents were recovered from any of the buildings from what I&#39;ve seen (except for the terrorist passport, LOL).  Most of the information was probably on computers or stored in databanks anyway, which would have been destroyed without any question.</p>

<p>Not really.  Again, it was all shipped to China and never examined in any detail.  We&#39;re also talking about WTC7, not the towers here.</p>

<p>Generally, some paper will be ejected.</p>

<p>It&#39;s getting awfully complicated, destroying a building, ensuring no paper is ejected in the process, ensuring nobody with ulterior motives gets their hands on it as it&#39;s cleaned up, etc.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;re not thinking through it like a risk manager, or someone who&#39;s completely fucked over if every detail isn&#39;t executed perfectly. Alternatively stated, a person who would have implemented such a conspiracy.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just ignore the risk that whatever you wanted to be destroyed would survive, just like you can&#39;t ignore the risk that whomever you got to lay down the demo gear would talk, or a myriad of other things.</p>

<p>If the &quot;plausible&quot; explanation for WTC7 being planned was to destroy the documents, the only logical path flowing from that is that the documents had to be gone before 9/11 ever happened. That&#39;s the only way to ensure success. And once you get those documents out, you&#39;ve already accomplished your objective. All you have left, really, is the building coming down to cover your tracks.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a test, and one that I&#39;m a bit too lazy to take on right now. Take a look at video of WTC7 coming down. Did anything get ejected?</p>

<p>Whether it was controlled demo or not, did any document from WTC7 survive?  You&#39;re asking me to speculate when we can just look at the reality that none of these documents have ever been produced.  Have you seen any?</p>

<p>...or that they were destroyed when the building came down.  Maybe that wasn&#39;t the reason the building had to go anyway, that&#39;s just the most common theory and one that seems to have a logical basis considering the number of important offices that were housed there.</p>

<p>Again, you don&#39;t need to have a theory for what <em>actually</em> happened to know that what the government <em>claims</em> happened is bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did anything get ejected?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure.  Was anything recovered?  Was anything legible?  It&#39;s easy to say <em>could</em> <em>would</em> <em>should</em>... but <strong>were</strong> any?  Is there anything to convince you that documents from WTC7 survived the building coming down?  I haven&#39;t seen any.</p>

<p>So apparently whatever happened to the building was sufficient to destroy everything stored within it, no?</p>

It makes zero sense to plan the building&#39;s demolishion. <em>So much</em> rests on them getting away with it. You don&#39;t think that they would leave it to chance, hoping debris would hit the building, do you? </p>

<p>Can you imagine that meeting? If some fuckwit brings that up, you&#39;d kick him straight out of your secret society. The entire conspiracy relys on them being simply idiotic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies, I just linked the wrong page <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/pull.htm">here you are!</a> I love the fact that you are so sure of yourself though. With <strong>zero</strong> claims that haven&#39;t already been explained. Here&#39;s an exercise for you, because you aren&#39;t going to answer logically as to why they would level WTC7. Any of the alternative ideas you have to the &#39;officail story&#39;, search for the opposite. <em>Try to debunk it</em> I guarentee you there will be answers. </p>

<p>But I&#39;ll ask one last question. Why does the collapse of the building look <em>nothing</em> like any demolishion done before? I love the idea that you think you&#39;ve outsmarted the &#39;Illuminati&#39;, “two planes three buildings lolololol, are u dumb sheeple? This was obviously the master plan.&quot;</p>
