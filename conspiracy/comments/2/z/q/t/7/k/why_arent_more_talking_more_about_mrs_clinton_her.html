        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s been in the main stream news recently,  Hilary Clinton hosting her own email server while S.s. and then illegally deleting many of them.  If it were more widely known that she basically conducted a coup in Libya during this time (by funding al qaeda to take out Gaddafi ), I think people would have been more outraged by her attempted cover up of the whole benghazi thing. .. which would lead to harsher penalties for her blatant disregard involving her personal emails.  </p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;d like to start a discussion on is, why are more people not seeing/talking about the obvious link between us funding al qaeda in Libya to kill Gaddafi, and that same funding coming back to bite them in the ass, resulting in the death of the diplomat a couple years back.  And Hillary Clintons position in all of this/ trying to cover up benghazi years back, more recently deleting all the evidence from her illegal private fucking server that she hosted while secretary of state?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly doubt that Mrs Clinton is dumb enough to write anything of importance via email.  The Clinton&#39;s have been investigated so many times that she knows better than almost anyone that everything in writing will be analyzed and scrutinized endlessly.  Some may argue that &quot;she decided what to delete on her own to cover-up stuff&quot;; well unless she sent these alleged emails to herself then they&#39;re still out there (if they exist) and will be uncovered.  However I&#39;d be shocked if she communicated anything of importance or scandalous via email; she&#39;s not an idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know she hosted her own server; I think she likely did it for convenience because I&#39;m betting it&#39;s her policy to not put anything of substance or importance in writing.  Communications about planning Chelsea&#39;s baby shower she&#39;ll send via email, communications about policy, budgets, covert actions or personnel, no way.  Why?  Well she&#39;s been investigated so many times that she knows putting any of that stuff on email is dumb.  She also knows that, sure she can delete stuff on her end but that doesn&#39;t delete it from the recipient&#39;s sever and since people have turned on the Clinton&#39;s before, she knows to avoid putting things in writing via email </p>

<p>If the MSM is spoonfeeding a story to the masses, there must be something rotten  in its integrity. I believe that everything plastered on the MSM is hyperbolic, spun and planned. I&#39;m calling that this scandal is a red herring, something bigger is going on behind the curtain. Maybe it&#39;s just for the purpose of ad revenue but the reputation of a popular presidential candidate does seem too big to expend compared to police violence or a mass shooting. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time a Clinton scandal broke the surface at a convenient time to misdirect the public attention. </p>

<p>There definitely is a conspiracy here but it&#39;s not what appears on the surface. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton is so neo-conservative that she probably makes Karl Rove blush. The email scandal is really just icing on the shit cake that is Hillary Clinton&#39;s political record.</p>

<p>While Secretary of State, she had a terrible foreign policy record, and broke numerous domestic and international laws.</p>

<ul>
<li>Caused irreparable harm to US foreign relations after WikiLeaks released diplomatic cables. Instead of apologizing and trying to remedy the situation, she demonized the leaks and sought to hunt down the people who embarrassed her by publishing her own words.</li>
<li>Performed invasive surveillance on world leaders of allied nations. She ordered her diplomats to steal credit card information, passwords, encryption keys, and other personal information from many world leaders, including Ban Ki Moon himself. Again, no apologies and no remedies after it was revealed.</li>
<li>Led the charge for banging the war drums for military intervention in any and every country possible, including Iraq, Palestine, Libya, Syria, and especially Iran. Anywhere where the United States had tension, she wanted a military response. As the former &quot;top diplomat&quot; of the US I think that shows how terrible she is at diplomacy.</li>
<li>Publicly supported the use of drone strikes across the world. It doesn&#39;t matter that the United States hasn&#39;t declared war in any of these nations, and frequently can&#39;t even identify the targets, which leads to massive civilian casualties. In her own words, she claims about drones &quot;we will always maintain our right to use force.&quot;</li>
<li>Obstructed investigations and justice in the Benghazi scandal. Clinton personally ignored warnings of an imminent attack, and refused to provide fortified security both before and after the attack. The blood of the killed diplomat is on her hands. Additionally, the base was being used by the CIA to smuggle weapons to ISIS, with cover from the State Department to state the base was a &quot;diplomatic mission.&quot;</li>
<li>Was negligent (if not aggressively passive) toward the uprisings during the Arab Spring. She made no attempt for diplomacy with these governments - she watched as they burned and said whatever was convenient and politically correct at the time. This is with the exception of Libya, in which she actively and publicly supported an American bombing campaign to force Ghaddafi out.</li>
<li>Supported and helped to organize an illegal invasion in Pakistan to kill Osama bin Laden. No justice, no trial, only murder. (If indeed that actually happened.)</li>
</ul>

<p>She is a classic, Machiavellian, <em>House of Cards</em> type politican. She will say whatever, do whatever, kill whoever it takes to get her more power. That is all she is interested in. She&#39;s a terrible candidate and it&#39;s really sad that someone so blatantly corrupt is the manufactured &quot;front-runner&quot; in our next election. The people are powerless to stop her or have the opportunity to vote for anyone different. It just goes to show you how out-of-control the government is.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Warren is the real favorite, but like Ron Paul, she is being shut out because she doesn&#39;t play ball.</p>

<p>Murder? Really? Please explain to me how the killing of Osama bin Laden was murder. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t mention that the raid was illegal, or that it violated Pakistani sovereignty. Just tell me how killing someone in the middle of a combat situation was murder. That&#39;s all I want to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Osama bin Laden was not in a combat situation.  He was in Pakistan, a country that the United States has never declared war against, and there was no active war battle at the time of his death.  In fact, the United States sent their military to his location with the sole mission of killing him.  I wouldn&#39;t call that &quot;combat situation&quot; or anything close to it.  I would call it &quot;assassination.&quot;</p>

<p>But keep shilling away man.  I don&#39;t know why you keep coming to this subreddit to annoy people with bullshit like this unless you are being paid to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say the word &quot;assassination&quot;, you make it sound like bin Laden was a political target. You would be correct in that assumption, but he was also a legitimate military target.</p>

<p>Unlike a politician, say the U.S.&#39;s President Barack Obama, bin Laden had an active role in planning several operations undertaken by al Qaeda. Whereas Obama tells someone to get something done and then approves it, bin Laden comes up with parts of the operations itself. In addition to 9/11, he planned several embassy bombings and a few operations in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>This role in the planning of an operation makes him a legitimate military target. Think of him like a general at a command post. He&#39;s remotely participating in the battle. Would you condemn a military for eliminating an enemy general? </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;ll admit that the operation itself was illegal and violated the sovereignty of Pakistan. But if you consider the situation the administration found itself in, you would see that it was possibly the best of a hell of a lot of bad choices.</p>

<p>&quot;Now I don&#39;t know if a lot of you heard this, but the CIA annex had actually -- had taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back. So that&#39;s still being vetted,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Broadwell continued, &quot;The challenging thing for General Petraeus is that in his new position he is not allowed to communicate with the press,&quot; she told the audience. &quot;So he&#39;s known all of this, they had correspondence with the CIA station chief in Libya. Within 24 hours they kind of knew what was happening.&quot;</p>

Communications about planning Chelsea&#39;s baby shower she&#39;ll send via email, communications about policy, budgets, covert actions or personnel, no way.  Why?  Well she&#39;s been investigated so many times that she knows putting any of that stuff on email is dumb.  She also knows that, sure she can delete stuff on her end but that doesn&#39;t delete it from the recipient&#39;s sever and since people have turned on the Clinton&#39;s before, she knows to avoid putting things in writing via email </p>
