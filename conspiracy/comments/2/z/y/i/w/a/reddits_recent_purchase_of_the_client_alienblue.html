        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/2zw4nk/what_i_though_was_a_ad_free_app_a_link_to_a_post/">http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/2zw4nk/what_i_though_was_a_ad_free_app_a_link_to_a_post/</a></p>

<p>I posted this last night after digging through some of the AlienBlue sub and found the wiki that told users ad free. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re familiar with AB you probably would have seen that the community is upset with the direction they&#39;re taking the app, with ads placed in their news feed. </p>

<p>After posting people were commenting and it had made it to the top of the sub. When I woke up this morning I couldn&#39;t find the link on the AB sub at all. The only way to get to it was through my recent posts. </p>

<p>Then I started making new comments randomly in the sub linking to the post. Each of those were deleted. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> but after posting on the sub and seeing my comments deleted  I can&#39;t think of anywhere to go. </p>

<p>Edit: looks like I&#39;ve been shadow banned with all my posts/comments. </p>

<p>Someone must be annoyed</p>

<p>Edit 2: thank you for for keeping an eye out! <a href="/u/AB-racadabra">/u/AB-racadabra</a> </p>

<p>HERE is the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zMtUq0E.jpg">original Alien Blue FAQ.</a>  Note that it says &quot;No Ads.&quot; in a feature list at the very bottom of the long page (you may need to scroll down)  This was what the FAQ looked like around 9 am Eastern Time today 3/22/2015.</p>

<p>HERE is the &quot;updated&quot; <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Z2PIGnp.png">Alien Blue FAQ</a> which was edited to remove the &quot;No ads.&quot; clause this morning.</p>

<p>It seems that <a href="/u/TheRedditPope">/u/TheRedditPope</a> edited the FAQ in an effort to avoid further misleading anyone.  I fully believe this was done with honor and it was meant as a correction to update the FAQ and indicate that there is no longer a &quot;No ads&quot; policy.  But many of us bought AB back looooooong ago (you know, like yesterday, or any time before that).  Many such people bought under the belief that AB wouldn&#39;t have ads if you pay for it.</p>

<p>The thing that bothers me is that KK&#39;s posting was mysteriously [deleted].  That is the real problem here.  Maybe the edit was done in good faith, but the deletion of KK&#39;s posting is a coverup if ever I saw one.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to know who deleted KK&#39;s posting and why they did it.  Did this discussion of Alien Blue features and problems somehow <strong>violate</strong> the subreddit rules of <a href="/r/AlienBlue">/r/AlienBlue</a> ?  How does that work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit, the front page of the internet, with the culture of free speech.  If you have the money.  If they would just be up front about the fact theyre story placement are manipulated by money and political views of the mods, I wouldn&#39;t give a shit.  Its the way they are standing by thier whole free speech crap here thats bull shit.  Just say what it is.  At least get the respect for being honest about it.  </p>

<p>Its twice as bad to do it and have it be false advertising.  Limit free speech all you want.  Advertise or portray your selves as having a culture (per their wiki page)</p>

<p>&quot;The website has a strong culture of free speech and very few rules about the types of content that may be posted.&quot;  of free speech, and then censor and ban people or minipulate the stories for political purposes, or for anything that isn&#39;t one of the obvious no no&#39;s, child porn, harassment, threatening, and now you have mislead the people here who actually do purchace things from the site or from companies that advertise here.  Some one can easily turn around and say, I wouldn&#39;t have bought from that service here if I would have known about Reddits censorship.  Censor the dumb massas all you want and get away with it.  Portray your selves as one thing when in fact its not, that is where the problem lies in my eyes.  Do what your going to do, but be up front about it, instead of mr sneaky mod.</p>

<p>I just noticed the mod in question was trying to argue with me in my post. I guess buying something and expecting it to be what I bought is &quot;petty&quot;</p>
