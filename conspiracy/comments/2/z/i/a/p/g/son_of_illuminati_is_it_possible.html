<p>Yes he&#39;s rich.  I suppose he&#39;s powerful to the extent he desires to be.  But I think you are a little confused if you think Illuminati=rich-and-powerful.  Illuminati means informed, more than any other thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to alleged whistleblowers, a member of the Illuminati could be Susan in the morning, who wakes up her kids, makes them breakfast, drives them to school and goes to work. But when she goes to sleep, she wakes up in the middle of the night as Lynda, who puts on her black robes and attends a human sacrifice ritual. </p>

<p>Lynda and Susan have never met each other. And poor Susan continues to suffer from the same chronic sleep condition that she had as a child. Sometimes she suspects herself of sleepwalking, but her husband -- who works as a consultant to a small private security firm based in Washington, D.C., -- assures her it&#39;s all in her head and insists she visit his old college friend, who happens to be a Psychiatrist, and could surely give her something that would help. The sleeping pills just make her sluggish, he says. </p>

<p>So yeah, maybe your dad is high-ranking Illuminati. Maybe your mom is a member, too. And maybe you are too!</p>
