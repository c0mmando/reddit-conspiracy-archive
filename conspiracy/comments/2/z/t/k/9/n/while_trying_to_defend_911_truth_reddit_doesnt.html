<p>When and why does this show up? Most of my recent posts have no downvotes. I just posted only one post defending the 9/11 truth:
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zsxd7/what_few_words_could_piss_off_most_americans/cpm4nuj">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zsxd7/what_few_words_could_piss_off_most_americans/cpm4nuj</a></p>

<p>Which got 1 downvote and immediately after that, i saw the message.</p>

<p>To my mind, it feels like censorship. But I just wanna know the rules behind it.</p>

<p>Edit: I just hit negative karma (-16) in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and now I&#39;m having trouble posting. Anything I said here got downvoted with little discussion.

<p>Reddit has ALWAYS been &quot;gamed.&quot; It&#39;s a for-profit business. It&#39;s here to market to you.</p>

<p>The 9/11 Liar movement is something different, they attack everywhere. I even had one post on my blog for weeks, pretending to be a fan, this shit a bunch of anti-truth nonsense.</p>

<p>I had another troll go to my other blog, attack me over the course of THREE YEARS.</p>

<p>Ask yourself, would you spend THREE YEARS harassing some random truther online?</p>

<p>What sort of person does that?</p>

<p>Look at Sepulchxr&#39;s history. It&#39;s essentially all he does, attack truthers.</p>

<p>He&#39;s even sent me creepy personal messages.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a specific poster that posts anti-truth stuff on the <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> forum. She&#39;s a professional actor - and a former call girl, interestingly enough.</p>

<p>They do pay trolls for this. Hasbara pays &quot;starving artists&quot; and other marginal people. They have a document with their talking points they just cut-and-paste. </p>

<p>If you refuse to engage them, they eventually start personal attacks.</p>

<p>Again - ask yourself - what sort of person would go around attacking truthers online?</p>

<p>The 9/11 Liar movement is something different, they attack everywhere. I even had one post on my blog for weeks, pretending to be a fan, this shit a bunch of anti-truth nonsense.</p>
