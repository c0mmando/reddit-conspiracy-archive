       But nowhere do they mention that the steel flowed out of the windows and was "flowing in channels like inside a foundry", nor that it remained molten for months afterward, nor that NIST gave impossible answers to these issues and did not investigate it further. They just barely know the facts, as if it weakened the steel beams enough to collapse and that's all that happened.

       I mean, if I go in there and say that this isn't even what we're talking about, they'll ridicule me to Hell and downvote me to oblivion. Do they just enjoy circle-jerking each other or what?

       I'm sure you're all pro-free speech if you're here, but you can't claim to support free speech when it's only on ideas you agree with. Part of what makes reddit not remove this sub for being a bunch of nut jobs also keeps racist, homophobic, and all kinds of nasty subs going. And those big meanies on top minds as well. Don't complain that a sub should be removed just because it doesn't strike your fancy

       Alright, so I can see when you say that the jet fuel "weakened" the beams, but.... only in the floors which were hit. If the plane hit on the 96th floor and there was damage from 93rd to 99th. That leaves how many stories below unaffected? In order for that building to come down as it did on that day, the columns on each level would have to buckle for some reason (which is unexplainable with the official story). Just because the top level beams where weakened, doesn't mean the other levels where also.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if we go by physics. There is more matter below the hit area. Therefore, the pancake "theory" is impossible, because it defies physics. A few floors
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       pancake down, but every time a floor is pancaked it looses velocity. Because you have a greater force pushing up (ie. the other 90+ floors) against the floors coming down. If we go by physics, than a few floors would've been crushed but then stopped. Leaving a "capstone" if you will, on top of the rest of the 90+ floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those building fell at free fall and literally turned to dust. This cannot be explained with the pancake theory. That would not pulverize metal, concrete, office equipment, people, etc etc.

       The claim that the collapse is impossible even by simple high-school physics is absurd because the collapse is easily studied by

        anyone

       and not a single physicist anywhere in the world, even Iran, China or Russia, has ever published any study that aims to prove this collapse is impossible.

       You're simple high school physics does prove it can't happen. Gravity also pushes up, ie the bottom 90+ stories. A pancake could happen to a few floors, not the entire building. Physics doesn't work that way. You might want to re read your HS books. There was an episode on King of the nerds that explains this. The winner won based on 9/11 truth physics and principles.
       <a href="http://www1.ae911truth.org/en/news-section/57-news-releases-by-others/931-pink-haired-nerd-scores-win-thanks-to-911-truth-websites.html">
        Here is an article talking about it.
       </a>
       . I tried finding the video of it that I saw on youtube, but it appears to all be taken down due to copyright bullshit. There was also a video on vimeo, but that too was taken down. So if you can, maybe netflix has it, so you can watch the video of her explaining and the actual contest.

       The hundreds of structural engineers who've contributed to numerous studies about the collapses have also somehow failed to notice these simple and blatantly obvious mistakes? Amazing.

       Classic truther argumentation. A claim is made e.g. molten steel. An explaination is supplied. Then it is simply not addressed, or explained why it is false. Then you say, "well what about
       <em>
        this

       The official explanation claims that office items mixed with the molten aluminum are causing it appear as molten iron.... Objects float on molten aluminum and like i said, the temps were admittedly not hot enough for straight glowing red aluminum. Im just giving you facts.

       Btw i just read (most of)that. Its nothing i havent heard. It doesnt change my mind. It doesnt explain the underground pools or the eyewitness claims from the basement. Molten metal aside. Theres no way the buildings could have collapsed like that without all the support columns being cut simultaneously. Theres so much more. Insider trading, suspicious call outs from work, the cell phone calls, the suspiciously small hole in the pentagon, the fbi whistleblowers who tried to give warnings and were ignored, the multiple foreign warnings, the lack of air defense at day, the convenient drills for the same situations, the saudi sale of airline stock, the hijackers found alive, the money made off of the wars, the lack of wreckage in PA, the announcement of bldg 7s collapse before it happened, the patriot act being prewritten, the story already set to go to the middle east....on and on... There is too much to ignore and the physics of it all makes no sense. Ive been there, i used to believe the official stories and for a while tried very hardr to convince myself i was wrong. Nonetheless im convinced we had foreknowledge and probably participated in the events.

       Ive already read the official theories many a time. You assume i come at this all with ignorance and for some reason want to believe it was an inside job. I would love nothing more than to find evidence that convinces me otherwise, but until then i believe we at the very least knew about the plans and did nothing to intervene.

       Firstly, you asked what could be the cause of enough heat to melt steel. Now you're moving the goalposts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I've seen that before but anyway:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Power puts thermite in a fired clay pot which
         <em>
          prevents
         </em>
         the heat from doing as much damage as it would if he had placed the thermite directly on top of the xbox. Ludicrous.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Power complains that the Jones/Harrit paper goes into detail about the provenance of their dust samples? Strawman.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The cartoon characters are ad hominem attacks on Jones/Harrit et al.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ad hominem attack on the Bentham journal. Power also uses two examples of hoax papers that were "accepted" by the journal. The fact is that the emails "accepting" the papers were attempts to find out who the hoaxers actually were. This was explained by the journal editors but is still completely ignored by debunksters.
         <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17288-crap-paper-accepted-by-journal.html#.U7JRFbEQGUM">
          "In this particular case we were aware that the article submitted was a hoax, and we tried to find out the identity of the individual by pretending the article had been accepted for publication when in fact it was not."

       Aluminum doesn't rust, and it doesn't flow red, it flows silver.

       And garbage "mixing" with aluminum doesn't make it red. And it doesn't stay molten for months red either.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not aluminum, it is steel. But naturally since all of the evidence has been taken and destroyed, then it's easy to make-up any answer and the people will follow you. That's the answer.

       Aluminium and office materials do not blend. Ive heard this shit before. Its like mixing oil and water, it would just float ontop. That is steel.

        Honestly, read through this entire page. The explaination is far too long to post here.
       </a>
       If you have issue with it, outline what it is here. I would
       <strong>
        love
       </strong>
       to read it. But if you leave questioning whether the rhetoric you've been told about molten steel is wrong,
       <em>
        question the rest of it.

       both the BBC and CNN or MSNBC interviewed six or seven of the named 'hijackers'
      </p>
      <p>
       they were people who had had their passports stolen and their IDs borrowed/stolen.
      </p>
      <p>
       its absolute fact that one third of the named people are or were alive in 2002.

      <p>
       now the question of wherever there were 19 real hijackers with real or borrowed names/IDs, that is another story.
