       Their original 6 part series that was Netflix, Vice guide to travel,  was intriguing.  Now that they are more mainstream people are bound to have this criticism but they still cover more stories then most other mainstream sources

       Shane Smith isn't fooling anyone. When i heard Murdoch was getting involved with Vice, i stopped paying attention to them. To me they barely exist.

       Oh yeah. It's a great way for writers to get some attention and jumpstart their career, no question. Also they don't have an agenda persay but I think OP's point was for all their bluster about being anti establishment they just gave the president a rimjob instead of talking about anything of value or depth.

       It's been a huge deal for a while. When they were aquired a lot of people did think pieces on whether or not this mean they were going to stay edgy. It's also been pointed out several times that they're owned by a billionaire but they still pay a pittance to their writers.

       They weren’t acquired, they sold off a 5% stake for capital funding.  It’s fucking sketch that it is Murdoch, but the man is a business man.  I don’t see Shane Smith being a sell out, but I do see it as impossible for an actual interview to occur with a sitting president.

       Exactly you can't have an edgy interview with POTUS and elect it to go anywhere or be vetted before the interview. The fact both the POTUS and VP gave them an interview shows they're at least stepping up their game from the trashy punk shit they used to publish. It'll give them more of a voice if they act like the rest of the major news media.

       Lmao as long as this isn't anotherm limited hangout snowden post... I'm all in.  Definitely something weird about vice.. And I've done a lot of reading on it. Vice even came and interviewed my friends and I last year for some documentary they were doing. I get a strange vibe from their employees. Nowadays they want to just become a top multimedia company.. Fuck being edgy and adversarial.  I gave up on vice.. Now I just read a select writer here and there from select papers and websites. Ahh who knows. Money and success corrupts

       George is trying to use the phrase "limited hangout" in more contexts so that his description of Snowden as a "limited hangout" has more meaning.  He's still "limited hangout" mindfucking people, imo.

       I haven't had cable in years,  and use my TV only to play video games or Netflix etc. It's becoming increasingly alarming that the mighty dollar is taking over many online sources as well.  I'm right there with you,  analyzing every source with an open mind is the way to go,  but even that can be an exercise in futility nowadays.  But as always I will stay vigilant and try to take the people I meet with me

       It might be a broken record, but it's 100% true, and is such an important topic, it needs to continually be brought up so people really understand who Edward Snowden truly is, and who he works for.

       I respect your opinion, and I do agree in principle, but I think one user obsessively posting and commenting about a single subject is edging into spam territory (no, I am not accusing
       <a href="/u/George_Tenet">
        /u/George_Tenet
       </a>
       of spamming, I'm making a nuanced point). My issue in this case is, the claim that this interview is limited hangout simply isn't true. It's a puff piece, yes, and a complete load of bullshit, sure, but not LH. Which kind of feeds into my point, that this user has become so obsessed with a single subject that their bias is muddying otherwise worthwhile debate.

       Vice is following an old strategy that has worked with many news websites, newspapers, tv-shows, hell even politicians. Great and alternative at the beginning, then slowly gets worse while people can't catch up and still think it's as awesome as it once was. You always need to be dynamic.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: Vice was pretty good once, but is now increasingly pro-establishment.

       Use your head, of course they're pre-screened questions, it's Obama. Still better than mainstream media. I don't have a hard-on for VICE but I don't understand all the hate either, it's like you want VICE to life up to their old indie standards when they're massive now.

       People write books about this you know, "In search of enemies: A CIA story".  It works so they keep doing it and people keep buying it.

       What isn't? Video games, books, TV, night clubs, any media, social clubs, sports. Everything is a distraction. So what are we supposed to be looking at? We're all humans just trying to enjoy the time we have here.

       VICE is shit media, and honestly a lot of their stories are very bias, sarcastic and condescending, especially their work in SE Asia. VICE News is a lot better than their main channel and sometimes produces quality work. The two channels should be viewed separately, even if they have the same management. One is bullshit entertainment, the other is journalism (even if you think it's poor quality).

       As for ISIS, there's no clear sources saying they directly funded them. Unless you can provide some? and don't link me the pic of John McCain meeting with ISIS leaders before they became ISIS. A real source.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS of course took a lot of money and weaponry from Iraq and other countries storage when they stormed over the middle east, but USA didn't want that to happen. War lines the pockets of American elite, but I think sometimes you give them too much credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious to them that bombing indiscriminately is going to cause people to help out "terrorist" groups. If you have no job, no education, no future, and USA just blew up your brother, fuck yeah you're going to fight back. USA knew this and created a problem. USA also want to maintain control in that area and ISIS has made that very hard, they don't want to fund ISIS.

       Yeah in their "Gun Crazy America" documentary they interview this guy who manufactures "80% AR-15 Receivers", a receiver that requires only minimal machining to make a functioning, serial number free, and LEGAL AR-15.

       Well there's an ideal world and an ideal yet realistic world. Most people don't want to have to defend themselves but unfortunately some people will inevitably have to.

       Sensible laws will NOT stop people from being violent, from stealing, from hurting others. Sensible laws CAN allow things like gay marriage, legal marijuana cultivation, and the right to firearms.

       This made me think of a scene from the new season of House of Cards(tiny spoiler) where Frank Underwood(as President) is being interviewed on Colbert's show and Colbert is just hammering him, making fun of his policies, calling him out on things and the like. Can you imagine Colbert doing that to Obama? He'd have to conceal his boner first, and even then it's quite unlikely.

       These media types and the sycophants who slop their jocks like they can do know wrong have a tough guy mindset where they imagine all the things hard questions they'd ask him and catch him in this or that untruth, but when they actually get the chance they suck his dick on camera and the seals in the audience gladly clap along.

       they are trying to humanize him so when people wake up they don

       You do know that to even get an interview with a world leader, any world leader, the interviewer has to agree to the vetted questions? If they don't, no interview. And if they are in an interview and they ask a question that hasn't been approved, the interview is over, and they get nothing in return. The recording's confiscated, they're kicked out, and no interview will ever happen again.

       What isn't? Video games, books, TV, night clubs, any media, social clubs, sports. Everything is a distraction. So what are we supposed to be looking at? We're all humans just trying to enjoy the time we have here.

       VICE is shit media, and honestly a lot of their stories are very bias, sarcastic and condescending, especially their work in SE Asia. VICE News is a lot better than their main channel and sometimes produces quality work. The two channels should be viewed separately, even if they have the same management. One is bullshit entertainment, the other is journalism (even if you think it's poor quality).

       As for ISIS, there's no clear sources saying they directly funded them. Unless you can provide some? and don't link me the pic of John McCain meeting with ISIS leaders before they became ISIS. A real source.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS of course took a lot of money and weaponry from Iraq and other countries storage when they stormed over the middle east, but USA didn't want that to happen. War lines the pockets of American elite, but I think sometimes you give them too much credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious to them that bombing indiscriminately is going to cause people to help out "terrorist" groups. If you have no job, no education, no future, and USA just blew up your brother, fuck yeah you're going to fight back. USA knew this and created a problem. USA also want to maintain control in that area and ISIS has made that very hard, they don't want to fund ISIS.
