    <div class="md"><p>There is no official story.</p>

<p>The biggest sign that the official story is untrue is the official story. The official story is fluid. It has changed constantly from the beginning. For example when you say &quot;the official story&quot; ask yourself what that term means to you, what you think happened. Remember the official story used to include the terrorist passport falling out of the towers while they burned. The official story used to include Osama living in a giant under ground bunker that looked like something out of james bond. The official story used to say a lot of things that it doesn&#39;t anymore. Write down what you think the official story is then do some googling. See if you can find 2 independent sources that verify that story. Then see how long either of them have been trumpeting that version of the story. Then wait a year or so and check again, tell me if the story has stayed the same. </p>

<p>Personally what changed my mind was reading the issue of popular mechanics that is supposed to debunk 9/11 conspiracy theories. Before that I didn&#39;t pay much attention to 9/11 or any of the conspiracy around it. 
I now think the official story is full of shit because of popular mechanics. Their descriptions of what happened are absolutely interplanetary. I can&#39;t remember it exactly but they said the plane at the pentagon vaporized and the plane in Pennsylvania just punched itself straight down into the ground and the wings folded up behind it and then - you guessed it - most of it vaporized. See, that is why there is no wreckage. Their theory of building 7 has since been dismissed and abandoned as well but you&#39;ll still find that issue being trotted out to silence dissent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing. I still see people vehemently defending the idea that the passport fell to the ground and was found by LE virtually unscathed and within hours of the crash.</p>

<p>Funny, looking into the story we find that a mysterious man found it and then ran off after giving it to LE. And thankfully this mystery man somehow knew it was the terrorists and gave it directly to the chief of the terrorism task force. </p>

<a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">NIST refuses to release data inputs for their computational collapse model</a>, saying it &quot;...might jeopardize public safety.&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>The model was built without physical evidence. &quot;In the month that lapsed between the terrorist attacks and the deployment of the [FEMA] BPAT team, a significant amount of steel debris—including most of the steel from the upper floors—was removed from the rubble pile, cut into smaller sections, and either melted at the recycling plant or shipped out of the U.S.&quot; -<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021128021952/http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/science/hsy77747.000/hsy77747_0.htm">Joseph Crowley, U.S. Congressman, Committee on Science, 2002. </a></p></li>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s">BBC reported the collapse hours before it happened, twice.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=877gr6xtQIc">Experts such as Danny Jowenko agree it is a textbook case of controlled demolition, before being told the building collapsed on 9/11.</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t the point.</p>

<p>Jet fuel obviously can not melt steel beams and NIST claim they found no melted steel beams, they only claim the steel needed to be hot enough to weaken them.</p>

<p>But, there is photo and video evidence of melted steel, you also have several credible eyewitness testimony, saying they saw melted steel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)</a>, literally gravitational acceleration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">(the official reports even admit this)</a> which is impossible in a steel framed building, there is nothing in science or engineering that would explain how every single supporting column would disappear within mere fractions of a second, the only explanation, within the realms of science, is explosives of some description, taking out the columns in a timed sequence.</p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>Why are they hiding this data? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles, if we have to go on what they have released so far, <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/NIST-collapse-model-building-7.jpg">a collapse model that bores no resemblance to the observed collapse</a> </p>

<p>Thus their findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data and so if anyone outside of NIST believes what they say, they believe it on pure faith. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QyTbq5P">Page 3 and the architect&#39;s appeal over the remaining 3370 files</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">Remember also that the BBC even reported that the building had collapsed 20minutes before it had</a>, remarkable.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YmynBCH.jpg">The tilting of the south tower,</a> just before collapse.</p>

<p>According to Sir Isaac Newton’s law of the conservation of momentum, it should have kept tipping over, but it didn&#39;t, it fell through the path of greatest resistance. The top was tilting at approximately 20 degrees or so, how could it be exerting a uniform, symmetrical pressure on the floors below? it didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nhsn9w9Vg">Watch a compilation of the collapse</a> what you are observing is approximately 30 upper floors begin to rotate as a block, to the south and east.They begin to topple over, not fall straight down.The torque due to gravity on this block is enormous, as is its angular momentum. But then  this block turned mostly to powder in mid-air! How can we understand this strange behavior, without explosives?</p>

<p>[Video evidence also shows that the lower sections of the Towers do not even begin to start collapsing until the upper sections are completely destroyed]([Imgur](<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg%5C)">http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg\)</a>) This is an impossibility if we are to believe the official reports </p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST&#39;s global collapse theory, in regards the complete collapse of two 110 story skyscrapers violates Newton&#39;s laws of motion.</p>

<p>It is scientifically impossible and completely illogical that these two buildings, which had an upper block exerting a force of only 36% of its static weight, could crush the larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building
to the ground, when the building, at any level, was designed to support several times the weight above
it,  while it maintains its downward acceleration. </p>

<p>The persistent acceleration of the top section of the building is
direct evidence that some other source of energy was used to remove the structure below it, </p>

<p>Videos show that the section of the building above the plane impact point was the first section to disintegrate</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Pentagon attack does appear of some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">Red herring</a> but there is not a single bit of evidence that a 757 airliner crashed at the Pentagon (the alleged photos of tiny scraps of the plane on the lawn are easily disproved by basic physics), in fact, all available evidence suggests the exact opposite.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewebfairy.com/killtown/images/flight77/generator/tgfshr.jpg">Before roof collapsed</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.osha.gov/as/opa/911/images/pentagon.jpg">After roof collapsed</a></p>

<p>Make up your own mind here, but ponder</p>

<ul>
<li>Where have the wings, literally, disappeared to?</li>
<li>Where are the two 4 ton engine impacts?</li>
<li>Why is there no physical evidence for a airliner crash at this site?</li>
<li>Why is the alleged pilot of this plane, not on the flight manifest and how did he avoid all CCTV at the airport, along with all the passengers?</li>
<li>Why does the alleged Flight11&#39;s flight data recorder show that the airplane was too high to have even struck the lamp posts?</li>
<li> Why did they tamper with the only video they ever released, which does not show an aircraft, only a small explosion and why did the FBI confiscate all CCTV in the area, in a coordinated, almost pre-emptive swoop</li>
<li>Why does the NTSB not plan to issue a report or open a public docket? The NTSB has issued a report for all planes that crash in the U.S, not for 9/11, Why?</li>
<li>The physically impossible Barbara Olson phone calls</li>
</ul>

<p>How would it even be possible that the Pentagon was hit 1 hour and 20 minutes after the attacks began? Why was there no response from Andrews Air Force Base, just 10 miles away and home to Air National Guard units charged with defending the skies above the nation”s capital?</p>

<p>and the above is just scratching the surface, the official account is truly bizarre, the probability that it can be true, really is zero.</p>

<hr/>

<p>All evidence suggests that flight 93, which crashed over at Shanksville, broke up before impact, there were <a href="http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h79/willuk7/flight93crash.gif">debris fields</a> miles and miles apart to support this conclusion, Donald Rumsfeld even said the plane was shot down</p>

<p>But still, we are led to believe that the ground literally consumed the plane! That’s right, the government claims (without a shred of proof or any evidence at all offered to the world) that the plane ended up completely underground. Remember though, they found the drivers license of one of the alleged hijackers, a bit burnt and found ABOVE ground, i am not making this up, this is the official story.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi Mom, This is Mark Bingham&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Perhaps the most compelling evidence in favor of the demolition theory is that the NIST WTC Reports, which took up to seven years to produce, exhibit all six of the characteristics of politically motivated pseudoscience</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lack of experiment - NIST performed no physical experiments to support its conclusions</p></li>
<li><p>The results of experiments were ignored or contradicted in the conclusions - steel temperature tests performed on the few steel samples saved suggested that the steel reached only about 500 degrees Fahrenheit. This is more than a thousand degrees below the temperature needed to soften steel and make it malleable—a key requirement of NIST’s hypothesis</p></li>
<li><p>There was no peer review and public comments from peers were ignored - NIST published its own WTC reports and therefore its work was not subject to peer-review as is the case for all legitimate science.</p></li>
<li><p>The findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data - NIST will not share it computer models with the public. A NIST spokesman declared, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, that revealing the computer models would “jeopardize public safety.”</p></li>
<li><p>False conclusions are supported by media or marketing propaganda - NIST’s pseudoscience was fully and uncritically supported by the mainstream media, many journalists have since stated they were under pressure from management to not report 9/11 stories if they were critical of the official narrative.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypotheses that are supported by the evidence were ignored - Throughout its seven-year investigation, NIST ignored the obvious hypothesis for the destruction of the WTC buildings—demolition</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude, the WTC reports produced by NIST represent the most obvious example of politically motivated pseudoscience in history. The physical experiments NIST performed did not support its conclusions. The reports were not peer-reviewed and public comments that challenged the findings were ignored. NIST will not share its computer models (the last supposed evidence that supports its conclusions) with the public and therefore its conclusions are not verifiable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>THE CALLS</strong></p>

<p>There are 2 calls that contradict the offical version of events; the before mentioned <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">Todd Beamer call and Jeremy Glick&#39;s.</a></p>

<p>Todd Beamer:</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Flight 93 hijack occurred at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">9:28</a></p>

<p>&amp;gt;Todd Beamer&#39;s call describes the hijack about to happen at <a href="http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/2001-09-11-FBI-FD302-lisa-jefferson.pdf">9:43</a></p>

<p>&amp;gt;Flight 93 crashed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Crash">10:03</a></p>

<p>&amp;gt;Todd Beamer&#39;s call made with an airphone last for <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">3925 seconds.</a> It last 45 minutes <em>after</em> the plane had already crashed.</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Lisa Jefferson also confirms that the call was not lost: <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Inspiration/2006/06/I-Promised-I-Wouldnt-Hang-Up.aspx?p=2">&quot;We didn’t lose a connection because there’s a different sound that you use. It’s a squealing sound when you lose a connection. I never lost connection, but it just went silent.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Jeremy Glick:</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Call starts at 9:37</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Flight 93 crashes at 10:03</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Call lasts for 7565 seconds, placing the end of the call at 11:41. It last for 1 hour and ~38 minutes <em>after</em> the plane had already crashed.</p>

<p>These calls were made from the airplane&#39;s airphone destined to two different interfaces: One was to the GTE&#39;s assistant landline telephone, the other was to a cellphone.</p>

<p>These calls could not have remained connected by a system mistake because airphones charge per time, the system was built to only count the time the client is connected in order to avoid overcharging him by allowing calls to &quot;stay connected&quot; when they were not. The fact that they also disconnected at different times rules out any possible system fault which, if possible, would at best disconnect both calls at the same time since they would have &quot;disconnected&quot; at the same time, the time of the crash.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/ACARS-CONFIRMED-911-AIRCRAFT-AIRBORNE-LONG-AFTER-CRASH.html">ACARS data also corroborates the above,</a> seen that the only possible explanation for the calls to remain connected after the airplane crashed is that the airplane from where the calls came from never crashed in the first place.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE TOWERS&#39; COLLAPSES</strong></p>

<p><strong>SOUTH TOWER</strong></p>

<p>The section above the airplane impact zone tilted and then fell vertically, violating Newton&#39;s First Law of Motion in which a body in motion (rotation in this case) tends to stay in motion unless acted on by an outside force. In this case <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcQOODryBDw">this was the expected movement of the top</a> if it was simply collapsing.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the top section tilted and was only ~30%(33floors) of the building it was still capable of destroying the remaining ~69%(76 floors) completely, directly violating Newton&#39;s third law.</p>

<p><strong>NORTH TOWER</strong></p>

<p>A problem with this collapse is that despite the fact that the top section fell vertically and almost symmetrically, it can be clearly identified a concentrated destruction almost as fast as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYW89xEYg0&amp;amp;amp;t=26">debris fall occurring on the right face of the building.</a></p>

<p>Sharing the exact same result as the South Tower, the North tower also violates Newton&#39;s third law by an even larger margin. The top section was only 15.45%(17 floors) destroying the intact <del>93%</del> 83% (92 floors).</p>

<p>According to NIST, WTC1 fell only 28% longer than pure free-fall:</p>

<p>&amp;gt;&quot;The upper section of the building then collapsed onto the floors below, within <strong>12s</strong>, the collapse of WTC 1 had left nothing but rubble.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm">NIST file NCSTAR1 section 2.9</a></p>

<p>If it was free fall it would have been 9.32s without air resistance, meaning that <em>-according to NIST-</em> all floors provided a resistance that add up to 2.77s (12s - 9.32s).</p>

<p>Below the collapse area there were 95 floors.</p>

<p>2.77s / 95 floors = each floor being destroyed in <strong>0.029s</strong></p>

<p>29/<strong>1000ths</strong> of a second.</p>

<p>According to NIST, each floor -composed by concrete and steel- was being destroyed as fast as the impact between a stick and a cue ball.</p>

<p>Despite the top being only ~<strong>16%</strong> of the building (weaker and lighter), the result was still a perfect vertical gravity assisted downfall destruction of the remaining <del>93%</del> 83% perfectly intact structure (<em>stronger as well</em>) defying yet again another law of physics -Newton&#39;s third law- in which a smaller and weaker body cannot destroy a bigger and stronger body.</p>

<p>For example: for every floor of the <del>93%</del> 83% destroyed another floor of the 16% has to be destroyed. If Newton&#39;s third law had been respected, the building would be standing with ~75 floors, not 0.
A better explanation of the laws of physics violation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;amp;t=2329">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;amp;t=2329</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>TOWER SEVEN</strong></p>

<p>Building 7 was hit by the debris <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wvNAAty.jpg">from one of the collapses</a> which caused fires and facade damage, one easily identified <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1E4Wrej.png">top to bottom gash.</a></p>

<p>Despite the presence of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/REuXNXp.jpg">large quantities of smoke,</a> there was never discovered any floor completely engulfed by fire, only partial fires and only on a few floors. The presence of<a href="http://i.imgur.com/LEeo3dH.jpg"> soot in the windows</a> are the indicator of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OZ16WEX.jpg">fires that were already extinct.</a></p>

<p>The only fires that last long enough and could be responsible for the building to collapse were only on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H25G67L.jpg">3 floors</a> and they were only partial small fires.</p>

<p>For a better comparison on the dimensions of WTC7&#39;s small office fires, here you have an example of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RckrL1M.jpg">normal office fires</a> (or just plain office fires) and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KeOLtCQ.jpg">extreme office fires</a> (or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8t40Tdw.jpg">infernos</a>).</p>

<p>By the time that the collapse initiated <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news-section/41-articles/761-fraud-exposed-in-nist-wtc-7-reports-part-1.html">there were no more fires near the vicinity of the section that was appointed as the collapse failure initiation.</a> This means that the building started the collapse for a reason other than fire.</p>

<p>Despite public belief, the building did in fact collapse with sudden onset of free-fall (<em>18 visible stories in 3.9s</em>), there were no stages. A better explanation is provided below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;amp;t=4536">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;amp;t=4536</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/07/11/video-analysis-of-nists-claim-of-a-5-4-s-collapse-time-over-18-stories-for-wtc-7/">http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/07/11/video-analysis-of-nists-claim-of-a-5-4-s-collapse-time-over-18-stories-for-wtc-7/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sharpprintinginc.com/911/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;amp;amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;amp;amp;PAGE_id=207&amp;amp;amp;MMN_position=616:616">http://www.sharpprintinginc.com/911/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;amp;amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;amp;amp;PAGE_id=207&amp;amp;amp;MMN_position=616:616</a></p>

<p>There was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">a loud explosion</a> that occurred right before the penthouse collapse. That explosion cannot possibly be from any structure &quot;snapping&quot; or &quot;failing&quot; because you would hear in that same video the rest of the building collapse as well, which you do not. If you cannot hear the entire building collapse then that explosion couldn&#39;t possibly be from a column failing.</p>

<p>In contrast with the WTC7 building, here you can see the other buildings that were hit with exponentially bigger forces (hit directly by the towers&#39; debris), some which under larger fires and did not globally collapse:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IG6zNy9.png">WTC3</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ajG1Eln.jpg">WTC4</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/W7wPbQJ.jpg">WTC5</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pN4Humj.jpg">WTC6</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vSKVhSB.jpg">Deutsche bank building</a></p>

<p>And here are buildings that suffered extreme office fires and did not turn into a pile of ruble:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody knows why or how it collapsed and the official story has changed about a half dozen times or more since 2001. First they said it was a raging inferno and the fires collapsed it. But no building in history has collapsed from fire. </p>

<p>Then they said that it was structural damage, that it was so wounded by shrapnel that its basic structure couldn&#39;t support itself and collapsed in on itself. But then a few photos of it were released showing that it had nothing more than cosmetic damage. The government has since cracked down on people posting footage or photos of building 7 from sept 11th. </p>

<p>Ok then they said that the vibrations from the first 2 towers falling caused it to shake loose and collapse? Like an earthquake I guess. </p>

<p>I think the current story is that in the 1970s, before Tower 7 was built there was a power substation on that spot. It was to integral to the NYC power grid to just tear down so they build building 7 around it and thus had to sacrifice its structural integrity to accommodate the substation. Kind of weird considering that tower 7 was also supposed to serve as the mayor and chief of polices headquarters during a natural disaster, riot or terror attack and was stocked like a bunker. </p>

<p>OK also there is the fact that several people in tower 7 said that bombs were going off in it and they were stepping over dead bodies before they got out and the building fell. These people who are on tape on the day of 9/11 saying what happened have either died or are just being ignored... because. </p>

<p>Also the footage looks like a controlled demolition, or at least it looks like one of the thousands of controlled demos that we&#39;ve seen over the years. We can&#39;t compare it to what a building collapsing from fire or earth quake looks like because... that like never happens. </p>

<p>That same investigation did their own collapse modeling and found that the collapse likely began at column 79 and spread throughout the building, just as NIST concluded, leaving the facade an unsupported shell before it came down.</p>

<p>There is some disagreement as to the role the Salomon Brothers generator played in the fires, but the mechanics of the collapse are consistent between both investigations and back up what can be seen visually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False. The collapsed model used was based on NIST&#39;s ridiculous model, which makes zero sense.</p>

<p>Also the main cause of the Aegis insurance claim, that the diesel fuel tanks were part of the problem in regards the fires, is polar opposite of what the NIST claim, that diesel fuel tanks had NOTHING to do with the fire. You have proved yourself wrong lol</p>

<p>So you either believe one or the other, on faith alone, because WTC7 is the perfect example of controlled demolition, everyone else knows that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought NIST was keeping their investigation into the collapse secret. Where are you getting your info? I&#39;m not doubting you I&#39;m just pointing out that for a long time the information on how they collected their data, built their models and came to their conclusions was sealed for &quot;national security.&quot; </p>

<p>Did these insurance investigators cross reference their private investigation with the top secret sealed investigation from NIST? If so... how? Was the information published in a form that could be peer reviewed in a public forum? i&#39;m curious because I&#39;ve heard different official stories for 14 years now. They&#39;re always proven impossible and then completely change. Each time we&#39;re told &quot;the evidence for this theory exists somewhere, we promise.&quot; And each time it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>When they said that it was tremors from WTC 1 &amp;2 and when they said it was falling debris and when they said it was a raging inferno and when they said it was the result of the 50 year old substation... Each of these stories were smugly trotted out as the official version with this condescending air of &quot;don&#39;t question us, we got science on our side.&quot; This is why I&#39;m doubtful about the latest version, and mark my words... this is just the latest version. Not the final version. And I guarantee that future revisions will have nothing to do with previous versions. </p>

<p>In an abstract sense - science is fluid. As new data becomes available previous theories must evolve to reflect the new information. This is why I distrust so much of the official story. The changes don&#39;t have anything to do with one another. It&#39;s not like they say &quot;our previous model didn&#39;t account for this new information but now we can actually say with more certainty that it probably happened this way.&quot;  I would respect that. </p>

<p>What actually happens is that they never admit they discovered new info or were wrong. They shit out all of these contradictory theories that don&#39;t have anything to do with each other and are never backed up with any science that can be verified by 2 qualified, public independent sources. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it takes longer than 9 minutes to read through the statements, but here are parts that I&#39;m talking about:</p>

<p><strong>Colin G Bailey</strong></p>

<p><em>Based on my work to date, including computer models by the University of Edinburgh, it is my opinion that if there had been a diesel fuel fire on September 11 involving between 7,350 and 9,300 gallons of diesel fuel on the fifth floor of 7WTC in the area of the transfer trusses, such a fire would have compromised the strength of the transfer trusses, and could have caused them to fail, resulting in the collapse of columns 79 and/or 80.</em></p>

<p><em>The computer modeling completed to date supports the conclusion that 7WTC would have collapsed as a result of typical office contents fires because of several design/construction failures, including the failure to adequately fireproof the flutes of the metal floor decking for 7WTC and the failure to ensure that a restrained floor system was constructed.</em></p>

<p><em>When a steel beam supports a composite deck, comprising a fluted (trapezoidal shaped) steel deck, concrete and mesh reinforcement, a cavity (or void) is formed between the top flange of the beam and the fluted deck. For fluted decks, such as those used on 7WTC, this cavity (or void) is large. Leaving the cavities between the fluted deck and top flange of the beam unfilled or inadequately filled with fire protection material results in:</em></p>

<p><em>an increase in temperature of the top flange and web;</em></p>

<p><em>an increase in temperature of the shear studs;</em></p>

<p><em>reduction in load capacity of beams during a fire; and</em></p>

<p><em>reduction in overall fire resistance.</em></p>

<p><em>In the UL Fire Resistance Directory for 1983 and 1985 the need to fill the voids is covered by the following statement: “Cavities, if any, between the upper beam flange and floor or roof units shall be filled with the fire protection material applied to the beam, unless stated otherwise on an individual design.”
The photographic evidence shows that the cavities were either not filled with fire protection at all, or were so inadequately filled as to have been unfilled for all practical purposes. See Exhibit A. An example of flutes in the process of being filled with fire protection on a different building is shown in Exhibit B. Exhibit C, which appears in the American Institute of Steel Construction Design Guide, shows another example where the flutes have been filled with fire protection.1 Failure to construct the building with adequate fire protection by filling the voids reduced the fire resistance below building code requirements.
The structural fire protection was specified by the 7WTC architect based on a restrained system. However, the main girder from Column 79 to 44 was not designed and constructed as restrained. The girder did not have a sufficient number of shear studs2 and the connections were not constructed to allow the adequate transfer of thermal thrusts to the supports as specified in the UL Fire Resistance Directory for 1983 and 1985. Specifying a level of fire protection based on restrained systems to a constructed unrestrained system resulted in a reduction of fire resistance for 7WTC.
The combination of very large floor bays, transfer trusses, cantilevered girders and unusual angles at which beams, girders and columns joined created a building that required careful examination and construction to ensure structural integrity. Such an examination and construction would include, but not necessarily be limited to:</em></p>

<p>...and on and on.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll end up copying Bailey&#39;s whole statement just to start, never mind the 5 other statements.</p>

<p>The failure to adequately fireproof the composite deck, combined with the unrestrained construction would have drastically reduced resiliency in a fire.</p>

<p>The other 5 statements say pretty much the same thing in more detail.</p>

<p>Supposed to do being the key phrase.</p>

<p>WTC7 was designed in 1983.  They didn&#39;t have the kind of advanced computer modelling available then that they do now.  Plus, with something like fireproofing, engineers aren&#39;t involved and are relying on subcontractors to do the job.  The state of fireproofing in WTC1 and WTC2 was a disaster too.  I imagine a lot of buildings have similar flaws.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, the ConEd substation was unique to WTC7.  I&#39;d bet there are other buildings with similar problems, but we&#39;ll never see them tested like WTC7 was.  Multiple floor fires burning for over 7 hours without a drop of water from fire suppression systems, no attempt from firefighters to mitigate the fires, plus all the design and protection flaws in the building.</p>

<p>To answer your question, sure it&#39;s weird that WTC7 collapsed.  That&#39;s why it was investigated not once but twice.  When 2 separate investigations come to very similar conclusions as to the cause of the collapse, supported by every codes organization involved in construction and fireproofing of buildings in the US, at that point I consider the question answered.</p>

<p>They disagree on whether smoke coming from the Salomon brothers generator area was in fact indicative of the generator burning.</p>

<p>Either way, the 2 investigations agree on the most critical point.  The building collapsing was a progressive failure caused by fire and not a result of controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Nobody knows why or how it collapsed and the official story has changed about a half dozen times or more since 2001.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plenty of people claim to know, including organizations like NIST and organizations like AE911 truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But no building in history has collapsed from fire. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just untrue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then they said that it was structural damage, that it was so wounded by shrapnel that its basic structure couldn&#39;t support itself and collapsed in on itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that was an initial assumption, but further testing led to the conclusion that structural damage played little in the collapse, aside from initiating the fires that eventually led to its collapse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But then a few photos of it were released showing that it had nothing more than cosmetic damage. The government has since cracked down on people posting footage or photos of building 7 from sept 11th. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering the prevalence of 9/11 conspiracy sites and resources on the web, I find that extremely hard to believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok then they said that the vibrations from the first 2 towers falling caused it to shake loose and collapse? Like an earthquake I guess. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never once heard that argument before. source?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the current story is that in the 1970s, before Tower 7 was built there was a power substation on that spot. It was to integral to the NYC power grid to just tear down so they build building 7 around it and thus had to sacrifice its structural integrity to accommodate the substation. Kind of weird considering that tower 7 was also supposed to serve as the mayor and chief of polices headquarters during a natural disaster, riot or terror attack and was stocked like a bunker. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was under the impression it had some offices of some official agencies. Source for the &quot;stocked like a bunker&quot; comment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>OK also there is the fact that several people in tower 7 said that bombs were going off in it and they were stepping over dead bodies before they got out and the building fell. These people who are on tape on the day of 9/11 saying what happened have either died or are just being ignored... because. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People report hearing explosions. Consider the events occurring around them, these explosions could have come from a variety of sources. Controlled demolition explosions tend to occur rapidly in sequence followed immediately by the building collapse. People hearing explosions hours before hand is hardly evidence of a controlled demolition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also the footage looks like a controlled demolition, or at least it looks like one of the thousands of controlled demos that we&#39;ve seen over the years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does it look like a controlled demolition? How many controlled demos involved bringing down the interior of a building collapsing first?</p>

<p>Now explain to me how that is at all relevent to the collapse mechanics of this particular collapse. Buildings are different, conditions are different. If it makes you more skeptical of the claims, that is one thing, but to try to use it as postive evidence of a controlled demolition is absurd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bldg 7, for example is indistinguishable form a controlled demo,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing as you are accusing me of coming into this with a pre-determined conclusion, I assume you think you are not guilty of this. So, In what way, exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUIEA7bi4_g">is this collapse</a> indistinguishable from a controlled demolition? You can see clearly that the interior levels on the left side fall first, as evidenced by the collapsing penthouse and breaking windows all the way down that side. Then, if you look at the penthouse on the top, you can glimpse the destruction moving along the top of the building, progressively moving along until the entire building, including the facade comes down. Explain to me how exactly this fits the profile of a controlled demolition? What demolitions require interior portions of the building to fall before the facade? Why do I not hear the numerous consequtive explosions directly preceding a collapse in any of these videos? </p>

<p>You could strengthen your point by showing me some of the modelling done by CD proponents to demonstrate the details of their conclusions. You know, analysis of the collapse, theories on charge placement, etc. I know there is an organization that claims a couple thousand engineers with plenty of resources that could work on presenting this. Where is their model?</p>

<p>In other words, put up or shut up. Don&#39;t come into this conversation accusing me of being ignorant, intellectually dishonest or whatever else you are implying if you aren&#39;t going to bother supporting you claims.</p>

<p>Why exactly is the building 7 indistinguishable from a controlled demo?</p>

<p>NISTs science is like Jeopardy, everything is backwards. They assume that fire damage caused the collapse and frame everything in that light. </p>

<p>If you start at the collapse and just analyze it as if it you had no idea what building it was, you&#39;d come up with tons of evidence for demolition and very little for other options. To put in simply, no other method can bring a building down uniformly, into it&#39;s own footprint, turning concrete to dust, dismantling steel beams, within the timeframe.According to science those buildings should have, worst case, toppled or crumpled in onto the weak points. Scientifically there is no other answer. You aren&#39;t going by science, you&#39;re going by NIST.</p>

<p>Explain to me with physics how fire can do these things. Not NIST. Science. I don&#39;t care if there are no sources or links. I want to hear you actually express how that could happen. Explain the pulverized concrete, the broken beams, the speed of the fall, and the uniformity. Forget all of the coincidences, the money made, the incentives, forget all of that. Just tell me with your own brain how that could have happened looking at it as if it is just a random building you&#39;re analyzing.</p>

<p>I wonder what happens to steel when a whole fucking building falls on it?</p>

<p>Black smoke = weak fires</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>-First responders report molten metal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does that have to do with a controlled demolition?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>-Near free fall speed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only the facade fell at free fall speed for roughly 2 seconds. What evidence do you have that a controlled demolition is required for this to occur?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>-Falls through path of most resistance.</p>

<p>Where the fuck else is it going to go? Pop up and flip on its side?</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear you know almost nothing about controlled demolitions and are intent to parrot whatever your truther sites told you. </p>

<p>You said &quot;But no building in history has collapsed from fire.&quot; Which is wrong. Now, if we are talking buildings the same size as WTC7, then there is significantly less, maybe even none.

<p>Well as far as I know NIST never tested the demolition theory and it was illegal to even take pictures at ground zero let alone collect samples or take measurements or anything else of that nature.</p>

<p>How exactly is this data supposed to be obtained by people who want to test the controlled demolition theory? We do not have access to the data needed to even begin doing this.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I said we have no way of determining that, so asking it is really a red herring. We can only speculate on the data that is actually available.</p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>Oh, here we go with this claim again. No it doesn&#39;t, because that excerpt you linked only refers to the North Face (as seen in the common videos), not the entire building. NIST&#39;s collapse modelling details how the interior collapsed many seconds before. You can see this clearly in the video as the Penthouse collapses and windows begin to break out from the force of the collapse behind it. Once the facade looses the support of the interior, it falls and eventually reaches freefall speed. </p>

<p>The entire building did not reach freefall, Just the North facade. This is mentioned directly in the image you linked, and described further in the body of the report not included in that image. It was a progressive collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did show inputs. They just limited the release of certain files used to detail specific elements of the collapse. Plenty of engineers can, and have, analyzed the conclusions of NIST without this data. All of the raw data (the inputs) was taken from analysis of video of the collapse. You can actually see the interior collapse on video before the exterior. The penthouse falls and and you can see the breaking of some exterior windows from the force of the collapse. Anyone with the means and motivation can conduct their analysis and compare it to NIST&#39;s conclusions. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/294k95/compilation_of_scientific_literature_that/">And they have.</a></p>

<p>The idea that these files are the lynch-pin of NIST&#39;s conclusions is a myth put forward by &quot;truth&quot; advocates like AE911, likely to mask the fact that in the years since the collapse they haven&#39;t even bothered to attempt a model of the controlled demoltion (despite taking in millions in donations and having 2500 &quot;experts&quot; on their side).</p>

<p>Plenty of people claim to know, including organizations like NIST and organizations like AE911 truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But no building in history has collapsed from fire. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just untrue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then they said that it was structural damage, that it was so wounded by shrapnel that its basic structure couldn&#39;t support itself and collapsed in on itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that was an initial assumption, but further testing led to the conclusion that structural damage played little in the collapse, aside from initiating the fires that eventually led to its collapse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But then a few photos of it were released showing that it had nothing more than cosmetic damage. The government has since cracked down on people posting footage or photos of building 7 from sept 11th. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering the prevalence of 9/11 conspiracy sites and resources on the web, I find that extremely hard to believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok then they said that the vibrations from the first 2 towers falling caused it to shake loose and collapse? Like an earthquake I guess. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never once heard that argument before. source?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the current story is that in the 1970s, before Tower 7 was built there was a power substation on that spot. It was to integral to the NYC power grid to just tear down so they build building 7 around it and thus had to sacrifice its structural integrity to accommodate the substation. Kind of weird considering that tower 7 was also supposed to serve as the mayor and chief of polices headquarters during a natural disaster, riot or terror attack and was stocked like a bunker. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was under the impression it had some offices of some official agencies. Source for the &quot;stocked like a bunker&quot; comment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>OK also there is the fact that several people in tower 7 said that bombs were going off in it and they were stepping over dead bodies before they got out and the building fell. These people who are on tape on the day of 9/11 saying what happened have either died or are just being ignored... because. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People report hearing explosions. Consider the events occurring around them, these explosions could have come from a variety of sources. Controlled demolition explosions tend to occur rapidly in sequence followed immediately by the building collapse. People hearing explosions hours before hand is hardly evidence of a controlled demolition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also the footage looks like a controlled demolition, or at least it looks like one of the thousands of controlled demos that we&#39;ve seen over the years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does it look like a controlled demolition? How many controlled demos involved bringing down the interior of a building collapsing first?</p>
