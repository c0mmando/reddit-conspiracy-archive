       Check my post history and you'll notice that all the posts concerning the genocide in Ukraine have been deleted without explanation, despite the fact that they broke no rules whatsoever. I didn't even notice until another redditor alerted me of the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is seriously wrong with the entire global socio-economic system if the "free world" supports and covers up genocide in Europe's largest country, including on the Internet. You have to aggressively deceive yourself not to see it.

       Worldnews mod here. Just to let you know Balangan, you are not banned from the sub, your comments were being removed by the sub's automod because your comment karma is sufficiently negative... it doesn't have anything to do with your stance on Ukraine. Automod is set to auto-remove comments from users who have excessively negative karma... this is done to assist in protecting the sub from spammers, trolls, bridgaders, etc. Unfortunately, you got caught up in that because of your low karma. I went ahead and approved all those comments manually, but in the future, so we don't have to manually approve all comments you make to the sub and so you can interact with the sub normally, it would be good to try and built up your karma elsewhere on Reddit so this won't be an issue. If you are unable to, however, feel free to message the worldnews mods and we can manually approve any submissions/comments you make.

       <strong>
        It seems sneaky that the user believes the comment is still up and only finds out by signing out of their account and clicking the permalink.

       Reddit is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       set up so that users are automatically notified or made aware when their submissions are removed by mods... not for just worldnews, but for any sub. I think some subs do had bots that send messages to users when that does happen, but I can't think of any those subs off the top of my head.

       I am talking about the fact that YOU see your comment even though nobody else does.

       If mods delete my comment because it breaks a rule, then I do not see it anymore. But there is another way to delete a comment, one that shows the user their comment but nobody else. That is what I am talking about.

       As far as I know, there is no way in Reddit for a user to look at their personal user history and know which comments (that are visible to themselves) were removed from the view of other users by either the mods or admins.

       Like I said above, that is not the case. His comments are being removed because of his excessively negative karma score... not because of anything having to do with specific words they use. In fact, the OP made a submissions to the sub
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2v6364/bessarabian_rebels_take_ukrainian_patrol_hostage/">
        HERE

       I have had comments deleted before, they show deleted in the thread, to me and everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are doing in r/worldnews is basically shadow-deleting people's comments. So it appears to them and they assume everyone else see's it too. The only way to find out is to be suspicious, sign out of your account, and then click the permalink button under the comment.

       Hmmm, as far as I have ever personally seen (and I have been on Reddit for awhile), comments removed by mods are not visibly removed by those users... they are only seen as removed if that user logs out. Can you show me screenshots of your comments from somewhere being shown as removed? That is not something I am familiar with seeing, but maybe some subs do that... but none that I am aware of.

       If I had not seen the comment deleted with my own eyes (while logged in) then I wouldn't even know that it was deleted, and I have had comments deleted before and I am pretty sure it was even in r/worldnews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it would be difficult to go back and find them, being that they were deleted and it was a while ago and from a different account. Anyways, so I guess we will just have to end it there, thanks for answering my questions though, I do appreciate it.

       I also doubt this one mod could change much if anything of a sub that size.

       The mod reaching out to this post and explaining how things work shouldn't be looked down upon, regardless if you agree w the justifications.

       After seeing the blatant corruption and childish nature of the mods over there, I wouldn't entrust any of them to "manually approve" any narrative. Even more so when his submissions clearly go against their pre-constructed reality they want the reddit hivemind to believe. The fact that he gave that sissy bullshit answer is a slap in the face to us.

       Fuck you, take your sympathy some where else I don't need shit.
       <br/>
       Reddit consists of subreddits.  You fucking understand that?  And you can go make a subreddit, and enforce whatever the fuck you want to.  That is what reddit is.  Not some pure ethical news source.  You don't take an ethics class to become a moderator.

       You missed the part where worldnews was a legit subreddit and then got taken over during the past 5 years and turned into a propaganda outlet run by psychos.

       I guess automod banned, sub-shadowbanned. You absolutely can set a user's submissions to be removed by default, although it is different to an admin level shadowban.

       They always have been, mods have had the power to remove posts and ban users since I've been on this site.  I don't think that in and of itself is the issue, the issue is when these powers (like all powers) are abused.

       You do realize that global research is a straight up propaganda site, right? They disregard actual facts to fit their agenda, and have been caught flat-out lying to try to justify/deny the Bosnian genocide.

       Many people talk about conspiracies such as WATERGATE, IRAN-CONTRA, THE S &amp; L (Savings and Loan) SCANDAL, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, OCTOBER SURPRISE, KENNEDY, THE FREEMASONS, THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS and THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION, and even GREY ALIENS, but very few people know the real facts enough to explain them because they are not researched themselves.  As information comes down the pipeline it becomes distorted and confused because most of the people passing along the information do not know the entire story, they have not

       Posting the truth to
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       is about as rewarding as banging your head against a brick wall, but if you MUST then I suggest you either create a new username or do something (prostitute yourself) to shake off your negative comment karma - it is almost certainly this which is causing your posts not to be visible.
