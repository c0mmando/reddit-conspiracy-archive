<p>Something is seriously wrong with the entire global socio-economic system if the &quot;free world&quot; supports and covers up genocide in Europe&#39;s largest country, including on the Internet. You have to aggressively deceive yourself not to see it.</p>

<p>The US government is paying people to post anti-Russian propaganda online. Look at the profiles of some of these posters in this thread- they registered a year ago or earlier, and their only posts are anti-Putin and anti-Russian propaganda.</p>

<p>As soon as you post anything against the corporate media narrative, you get massively down voted within minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worldnews mod here. Just to let you know Balangan, you are not banned from the sub, your comments were being removed by the sub&#39;s automod because your comment karma is sufficiently negative... it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with your stance on Ukraine. Automod is set to auto-remove comments from users who have excessively negative karma... this is done to assist in protecting the sub from spammers, trolls, bridgaders, etc. Unfortunately, you got caught up in that because of your low karma. I went ahead and approved all those comments manually, but in the future, so we don&#39;t have to manually approve all comments you make to the sub and so you can interact with the sub normally, it would be good to try and built up your karma elsewhere on Reddit so this won&#39;t be an issue. If you are unable to, however, feel free to message the worldnews mods and we can manually approve any submissions/comments you make. </p>

<p>What you are doing in r/worldnews is basically shadow-deleting people&#39;s comments. So it appears to them and they assume everyone else see&#39;s it too. The only way to find out is to be suspicious, sign out of your account, and then click the permalink button under the comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, as far as I have ever personally seen (and I have been on Reddit for awhile), comments removed by mods are not visibly removed by those users... they are only seen as removed if that user logs out.

<p>Of course it would be difficult to go back and find them, being that they were deleted and it was a while ago and from a different account. Anyways, so I guess we will just have to end it there, thanks for answering my questions though, I do appreciate it.</p>

As information comes down the pipeline it becomes distorted and confused because most of the people passing along the information do not know the entire story, they have not <a href="http://goodnewscommunications.net/corruption-and-rot-destroyed-the-4th-largest-military-in-the-world/">researched much information</a> themselves, and  they tend to be biased as well.</p>

<p>Posting the truth to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> is about as rewarding as banging your head against a brick wall, but if you MUST then I suggest you either create a new username or do something (prostitute yourself) to shake off your negative comment karma - it is almost certainly this which is causing your posts not to be visible.</p>
