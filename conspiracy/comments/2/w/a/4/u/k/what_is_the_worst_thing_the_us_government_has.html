       Depends on how you calculate worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gulf of tonkin false flag lead to what...60k deaths in vietnam?
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence FDR had advance warning of pearl harbor, ignored it because he/US government wanted a conflict. Had the US government not put a trade embargo on oil to the japanese american involvement in WWII would have probably not happened. All that combined lead to what? 200k+ americans dead?
      </p>
      <p>
       SV40 cancer causing virus in millions of american vaccines, explains much of the rise in cancer rates the past 40 years. Government sanctioned of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then of course we have 9/11, loss of liberties, thousands of americans dead, millions of innocent civilians dead, bankrupt government etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another big one is suppression of free energy.

       Lots of good examples to choose from.

       The free energy thing was JP Morgan. Or was that not true?

       I was watching the show on Netflix about the men that shaped america. It said that one time the us government had to ask JP Morgan for a bailout. I mean wtf. That is very troubling.

       Yep, JP Morgan. He was happy to fund Tesla's free energy tower that would wirelessly transmit energy everywhere...until tesla told him there was no way to meter it...then he shut him down.

       Well it's not like it's lead to many direct deaths (other than scientists/researchers) but if we had free energy the entire world would be so much better off. Everyone's standard of living would be drastically higher.

       the war on drugs is complete bullshit. I understand drugs like coke and heroin being illegal. but shrooms and pot are not as bad as portrayed in the law, totally not worth a schedule 1 classification.

       How can you understand coke and heroin being illegal? Do you believe that government has a right to dictate what you consume? That you don't have a right to do what ever you want to yourself, as long as you doesn't harm someone else?

       This + that article a couple weeks ago of drug addiction actually being bonding with drugs, which had scientific proofs.  The entire 'war on drugs' is pretty ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, at the same time it's easy to understand why there's a legal age of alcohol consumption, age of consent, and so on.  What I think the law should really say is a specific age where you're allowed to do
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       drugs, primarily for the reasons of brain level and maturity, partially for bodily tolerance.

       Drug addiction to things like heroine and coke lead to theft. Also, ask any heroine addict if they would literally kill for more heroine if it was the only option. I guarentee you they will say yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes those should be illegal because the people who get addicted to those things WILL cause problems for other people. Maybe not every single person that does those drugs will, but it seriously lowers crime rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Decriminalized with social healthcare is the way to go though, for it gives you freedoms and help that isn't just "more methadone please".

       People steal and murder because of a drug culture/system created by prohibition. People only commit crimes to procure the funds for drugs because these drugs are inaccessible/ expensive and they don't have the ability to be treated because of legality. If you make cocaine legal, this allows for provide rehab techniques to be developed, which can't be done if its illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, the things you are saying is exactly what the women's league argued regarding prohibition, and how fucking stupid do they look now.

       It's a lot easier to control addiction to alcohol then heroin for most people.. If heroin were legal, most people wouldnt just be able to go to the bar, shoot up once or twice a week, and not be fiendishly addicted. Yes, like i said in my post, if social healthcare were instated and these things were DECRIMINALIZED (NOT LEGAL) that would be the optimal solution. But in the US, if we we were to just legalize all drugs tomorrow, our country would be in shambles.

       First of all it's heroin. Second, no not every addict will kill for more of whatever they're doing, nor will they all steal. I was a pill/ heroin addict for several years as were a lot of my friends and not one of us killed anybody or snatched an old lady's purse for the next fix. Contrary to popular belief, you can be an addict and still be a decent human being.

       Maybe not everyone, but most. There's always exceptions. It also depends on the amount of money you have. If you had enough money to support your habit, good for you, but im sure if you ran out of money and absolutely could not get any I'm sure sooner or later you would do something you weren't proud of for it.

       It is an undeniable part of our culture to have the desire to protect and care about children, so we often see them as helpless but precious.  Thus it is not me who is ageist, but rather our culture.  This is not the case for women though, who should be treated as equals to men.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, is it actually unfairly discriminatory to treat the undeniably less capable and less independent group of younger (and thus inevitably less experienced) humans differently?  It is so much more like providing handicap parking than it is like picking on someone because of their ethnicity.

       I think it's funny other responses are only mentioning harm done to Americans. Vietnam killed 60k Americans... and millions of Vietnamese. Most of the damage of the US is done to outsiders in order to benefit those more on the inside (the middle class) to convince them to go along with the ruling agenda.

       When I say middle class I mean all the people who go along with the status quo in positions of relative comfort, help it to continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it like you're a king in medieval times. You need knights, priests, aristocrats, lawyers, etc. in order to help you run your kingdom. You can't do it yourself. Just like today, the ruling class needs managers, IT professionals, people to make entertainment to distract people, etc. There are all kinds of people who don't have much decision making power who are nonetheless kept relatively comfortable by the domination system in order to ensure their continued commitment to its cause. That's what I mean by the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       More and more people are become superfluous to the ruling class, of course, and the main problem is how to keep them from causing trouble (the answer: prison, drugs, entertainment, religion, and whatever their nefarious scheme for depopulation is).

       The murder of MLK. The U.S. government was found guilty for the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and yet we have hundreds of roads and streets band after him and gave him his own holiday in recognition of his heroism. But it's all bullshit, (Not him being an outstanding man) but the fact that even though they were found guilty it does not matter because we as citizens let it slide.

        Giving control over the financial system to private bankers in the form of the FED. Look what kind of shit they created.
One Dollar lost 2291.3% of is value from 1913 up till now.
The same item that costs 20 Dollar in 1913 costs 478 Dollar and 25 cents now!
In 1913 the price of one ounce of fine gold was 19 Dollar.
the price of one once of fine gold in 2015 is 1200 Dollar.
That means gold gained 150% of its value against the Dollar or the Dollar lost 61% of its real value.

       A world power can be poor or bankrupt and still be totally innocent.  I'm certainly not saying that America is or that it's a good thing, but a bad economy isn't even in the top 10 of worst things America has done, especially considering the countless atrocities.

       The civil war itself and the circumstances that caused it come to mind (just seems to me to be more poor people killing poor people while bankers pull the strings).

       The Tuskegee experiments are a frightful departure from ethics that everyone should be aware of when considering how governments (and doctors) treat and view the public at large and also minorities or anyone who has been dehumanized in society.
