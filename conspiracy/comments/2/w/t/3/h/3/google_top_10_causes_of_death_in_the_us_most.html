       Definition of adverse drug reactions: An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an injury caused by taking a medication. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs. The meaning of this expression differs from the meaning of "side effect", as this last expression might also imply that the effects can be beneficial. The study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as pharmacovigilance. An adverse drug event (ADE) refers to any injury occurring at the time a drug is used, whether or not it is identified as a cause of the injury.
       <strong>
        An ADR is a special type of ADE in which a causative relationship can be shown.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is separate from people taking more medication than recommended and people taking medication they are not prescribed. 100,000 people die from simply going to the hospital and taking prescribed drugs appropriately.

       I don't think cancer is included in adrs. That would increase the death count if anyone decided to figure out how many cases can be traced directly to medication-induced cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adrs are typically reactions between two medications, reactions between a med and a disease, and a reaction to a drug based on genetics.

       If you actually download the whole chart drug induced deaths sit at 46, 471 deaths. That most likely includes adr and ade but I'm guessing rules out suicide because suicide was it's own category? ADRs are not reactions between 2 medications, that's an ADE. ADRs are essentially side effects ie unintended consequences of a normal dose where as ADEs are overdoses, drug drug interactions etc.

        However, other studies conducted on hospitalized patient populations have placed much higher estimates on the overall incidence of serious ADRs. These studies estimate that 6.7% of hospitalized patients have a serious adverse drug reaction with a fatality rate of 0.32%.2  If these estimates are correct, then there are more than 2,216,000 serious ADRs in hospitalized patients, causing over 106,000 deaths annually. If true, then ADRs are the 4th leading cause of death—ahead of pulmonary disease, diabetes, AIDS, pneumonia, accidents, and automobile deaths.

       " The Institute of Medicine reported in January of 2000 that from 44,000 to 98,000 deaths occur annually from medical errors.1 Of this total, an estimated 7,000 deaths occur due to ADRs."
      </p>
      <p>
       It says that right below the slide that says ADRs are responsible for 100k+ deaths annually. Thought that was strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it's difficult to argue ADR vs ADE since one encompasses the other. For example, in the "drug information handbook" put out by lexicomp, adverse drug reactions are listed completely separately than drug interactions. But the way the power point you linked is using the statistics (saying 100k died from adr then says 7k of 98k medical errors) it almost seems as if they are using the 2 phrases synonymously.

       I included another source in my original post. It's between 100 and 200 thousand deaths.

      <p>
       And as for the FDA website claiming two numbers- that's because they are talking about more than one source of data. If you find any reason to doubt the higher estimates, I'd be more than happy to consider it.

       Assuming that all of the drugs that caused the deaths actually "save lives" - which would be a false assumption, as many of these killer drugs do not "save lives" (e.g. NSAIDS / acetaminophen, etc) but merely improve quality of life.

       Sigh.   Ok, I'm not going to argue about all this stuff.  I'm actually a very interested member of this sub, but I make a point to keep myself in check and look at things objectively and because I know better, I'm not going to get into this.
I really like you guys, and love the trajectories information here sends me on, but I also see so much blanket negativity here that it keeps me from posting.
I'm convinced there's a certain.. trajectory, or idealism.. not sure of the right word... that some people here go on that makes them only focus on the negativity of things and only sees things like this some kind of corrupt conspiracy to fuck us over.  I know it's not that, but no matter what information I share with you it won't change your mind.  There's zero chance.  So arguing will only reinforce your preconceptions.
