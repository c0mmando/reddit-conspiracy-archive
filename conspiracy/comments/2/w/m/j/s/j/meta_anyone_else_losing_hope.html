        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t mean to be negative but I have been personally having trouble living with the knowledge of how things are. I live in the United States so I know things could be worse, but at a grand level I feel like things could be so much better than it is. Corruption at the highest level, state-sanctioned propaganda also known as the mainstream media, almost complete unawareness from the general public and it doesn&#39;t seem to be getting better. Combine this with many dummy reddit accounts created for the sole purpose of downvoting <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ideas across the majority of major subreddits where the ideas could be greater exposed. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> itself is quite fractured in its current state, with many users posting ridiculous content that gets upvotes while the serious, well-researched content gets ignored. The things I&#39;ve seen on reddit alone over the past few years I&#39;ve been coming here (this isn&#39;t my first reddit account) have been disturbing.</p>

<p>I was &quot;woken up&quot; to the world of conspiracy in 2011 and the 2012 elections cemented my beliefs. However there are times where I just wish I could unlearn the things I know and go back into the mainstream just so I could have a depth of enjoyment with others. Looking into the future there is a real possibility of Hillary Clinton being President or another Bush on the GOP side. </p>

<p>What are some ways you have done to deal with the knowledge of being &quot;woken up&quot;? For me it has basically become withdrawn from certain interests that I used to love, which in turn has somewhat negatively affected the way I interact with people I used to be closer with. I have not engaged people directly, just withdrawn my support for certain things, I guess because I am worried about them thinking I am crazy. I know I am being a bit vague and could go into specifics if you want but this has been the case for me. I am just tired of waiting for some grand world revolution where everyone sees the light, because it doesn&#39;t seem like it is going to happen anytime soon unless something changes it, something extremely significant.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the responses everyone this has left me feeling a bit better knowing that other people are or have experienced the same things I have</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, going down the rabbit hole leaves you alone in this world, the truth is a heavy burden. This is why people don&#39;t seek it. I don&#39;t know how far you have gone, but I&#39;ve gone pretty deep. So deep, that I&#39;ve just packed my bags and moved away. I live in wilderness and love it. Not many people around, I see a lake out my backdoor, I have my dog, the stars are mind blowing. Sadly I lack IRL &quot;friends&quot; who know. My family is getting there, I love them more than anything. I&#39;ve gotten to my ma, we talk about these types of things, she gets it. I&#39;m working on my other family members. My friends are all divided or &quot;too busy&quot;. I talked to one about gay rights and said &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we get to the bottom of why we have a marriage license and tax deductions, ie. the FED and the current fiat system we have? Wouldn&#39;t that solve this whole stupid issue?&quot;. Friend says, &quot;gay rights is important and we need to have the same rights&quot;. Completely missing the bigger issue at hand.</p>

<p>There is a bigger issue here, the FED and taxes. Why in the world is the gov in our business, especially the marriage business? George Washington did not have a &quot;marriage license&quot;! Just an example, but people are so divided on trivial issues, that they cannot see the bigger one. TPTB have done a great job with this (divide and conquer). When I talk of things, I&#39;m looked at like an alien or &quot;crazy&quot;. Even though it&#39;s so painfully obvious if you care to just tune out and if you listen to me talk, I&#39;m completely rational and express my opinion in a well thought out way. A crazy person cannot do this. It&#39;s just so many people are tuned in. Just remember some of the greatest people in history were called &quot;crazy&quot; by their peers and society. It&#39;s how people react to others who &quot;think differently&quot;. :) cheers mate, we&#39;re here for you.</p>

<p>PS. The revolution will happen when people are hit at home (ie have no food, there money is worthless, lose their job, etc), It&#39;s all a waiting game, but do your best to try and help others. Eventually the house of cards will fall, and that is where we step in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moving away sounds like a pleasant thing to do tbh. I live in a congested city where I used to live on an old farm property and I miss it so much. The air was amazing and it was so peaceful. Even wild animals where fun to see</p>

<p>I have opened up a little bit to my family when discussing politics but I don&#39;t live near them enough to talk to them every day. I guess they have been the people I&#39;ve most influenced about this subject (they went from neocons to supporting Ron Paul in 2012). </p>

<p>I looked up on Google what you said about truth being a burden. <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/05/gaye-levy/the-burden-of-truth-and-knowledge/">This article</a> came up, which is an excerpt of <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/burden-of-truth-and-knowledge/">this</a> survival page. I definitely identified with the writing, but there has to be more.</p>

<p>I just wish I could reach out to people and not let them be blinded</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you, moving away was the best thing for me. I have land, I see deer, wolves and foxes. I can hunt and fish and have good, clean spring water. I used to live in the suburbs, and I hated it. Just because you aren&#39;t living close doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t pick up the mobile and talk. Talk to them, they talk to others. Truth spreads like a wild fire. I hear you on that about your family.  Mine were in the same situation. Hardcore conservatives, who are turning libertarian. I don&#39;t like &quot;terms&quot; but libertarian is the right direction. Best you can do is, join in conversations outside of here (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>). I&#39;m making that jump and my karma points are feeling it. lol, fuck the karma and start planting seeds. Truth will out eventually!</p>

<p>Nicely said. If we focus all of our attention at the forefront, we lose. We all are better allocated in the next front, several steps ahead. I feel like this is why the term &quot;prepler&quot; has become (or is becoming) the same as what had happened to the term &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a waiting game. When the time is ready, good people like us will fill the void. I&#39;m sure of it. Let&#39;s just love eachother, and help as many as we can. Because when SHTF, we need to stick together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really, I&#39;m just learning as I go. Plenty of youtube will teach you things. I know how to fish, I&#39;m a decent shot (I need practice though), next gaming season I&#39;m going to start hunting deer, I think with a bow (never done it before). Nothing against guns, I think we should all have 1, but there are a lot of moving parts. So, I&#39;m going to go with a bow and try to master it. As far as planting seeds, I&#39;m learning. It&#39;s dead of winter here, but when spring comes I&#39;m going to start a garden. Everything in life is kinda just &quot;learning as you go&quot;. I&#39;m in a good position where I&#39;m not completely isolated, there is a country store a few miles down the road, that has supplies. But this is the first step. If I can learn in this environment the necessities, I plan on moving further north. It&#39;s like a perfect testing ground here.</p>

<p>The propaganda is getting so stupid and terrible that I don&#39;t know many people in real life who are swallowing it whole (plenty people still in partial denial about a lot of things, and honestly, I can&#39;t blame them); I kind of wonder what&#39;s up with the media and government and corporations, though, that they are perpetrating such stupid cartoons (not to defame cartoons, which are awesome) with straight faces.</p>

<p>You have lost the comfort of believing the information that has been provided to you, but you have gained the wisdom to find the truth.</p>

<p>You can apply this to something as simple as breakfast.</p>

<p>First, recognize that commercially available food products are adulterated and mass-produced at the lowest possible cost, irrespective of impacts on your health and nutritional content.</p>

<p>Then set out to acquire the genuine articles to see whether there is a difference. Find naturally raised bacon and eggs, free of hormones, antibiotics, chemicals, etc. Buy some heavy whipping cream, and blend it into butter yourself.</p>

<p>Be specific, be demanding, and accept no substitutes.</p>

<p>As you enjoy your first genuine breakfast, you can contemplate the value of truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A wise man once said that ignorance is bliss, thus, to know is to suffer.</p>

<p>The more one learns, the more one suffers. How do we accept this? You obviously feel it. I have been feeling it. Many in this sub, the regulars, have been feeling it. Thats just the way it is.</p>

<p>But i csnt leave it at that.</p>

<p>There is another, related, saying. The more one learns, the more ignorsnt they become. This is important. The more you learn, the more you are able to realize and acknowledge that which you do not know (fyi, &quot;that which you dont know = ignorance).</p>

<p>Come full circle... </p>

<p>Its tought. Its a long, grueling journey. Many of us have been through it. Its sometimes painful. Just hang in there. Take a break from reddit for a few days or a few weeks if you need to. I have. Others have, too. It helps sometimes. But i bet if you do, youll be back stronger than before. </p>

<p>Also, you definstely need to learn hoe to compartmentalize your &quot;conspiracy&quot; thoughts eith your &quot;IRL&quot; thoughts. Dont forget to enjoy life man. If in real life, you get an idea about conspiracies, wait til later. Dont be clingy, in an ideological sense. If youbforget by the time you get back on reddit, it probablh wasnt thst important in the first place.</p>

<p>But seriously... Learn to compartmentalize, and more importantly, learn to enjoy the life thst we hsve. If we are correct, amd i hope we are not, this life we have now wont last forever... Might as well love it while we have it, than miss it when we have lost it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off we are going though really extreme times right now, we are on the threshold of a massive shift in consciousnesses. It could go either way so its important to stick to your guns and work on things that give you satisfaction. I to have had to withdraw from some of the things I used to find enjoyment in. I think those things are probably not the best for me any more and so have been slowly moving toward things that help humanity. Its not easy right now, probably one of the hardest times to be alive. Someone said that (if you believe in reincarnation) that those who have choose to incarnate at this time are very brave because it will be the most difficult and the most exciting time for humanity as we shift towards new levels of consciousness.
I recommend reading &quot;The Hathor Archives&quot; by Tom Kenyon It has help me shift my awareness.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just trying to learn as much as I can along the way and while the ship goes down.</p>

<p>I imagine I&#39;ll be back on this rock eventually sometime.  Most of us, it seems, will.  I&#39;m just trying to be as mindful as I can be now so that I can do better and better in future incarnations and that hopefully will allow me to eventually never have to come back here again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seek spiritual enlightenment. Get to a point where you can feel unattached to your life. Do whatever it is on your list of things to do before you die that you could accept dying now, should it come to pass.</p>

<p>Once you don&#39;t care about that, all this stuff just becomes amusing. Granted, I feel a little insulated from potentially forthcoming globally catastrophic events, like a nuclear war on account of living relatively remotely, but I cannot believe that there will really be a catastrophe in the US or the other anglo countries. </p>

<p>Also, I would suggest not getting your hopes up about effecting social change. I.e., find hobbies that have nothing to do with politics and pursue those. There are still plenty of real things in the world despite the fakery of the govt.</p>

<p>What&#39;s even cooler is that things that are controversial don&#39;t have many people pursuing them. For example, ancient archaeology. There is heaps of evidence for ancient advanced cultures far further back in time than conventional history insists. But, because that idea is so controversial, no one wants to touch it and consequently there&#39;s still a lot of amazing discoveries yet to be made in that field.</p>

<p>That&#39;s real, too.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking of things in the world that are actually real things and genuinely interesting and cool. I think once you accumulate enough of those musings, it starts to not matter so much that humanity is so completely batshit right now.</p>

<p>Anyway, good luck.</p>

<p>Give yourself time to determine your strengths, your passion and your ability! When you&#39;re more settled in your own skin you&#39;ll stop worrying about what others think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think withdrawing is not the best way to deal with this. You should try to get info on how to maintain a positive attitude. The revolution is already starting; people are becoming aware, that&#39;s <em>the shift</em>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important that you treat yourself well by not allowing all the negative news to effect you mentally, which can weaken your immune system (I read this and it&#39;s helped me), get out and do things that make you feel good. </p>

<p>You have to stay strong in the midst of chaos, we all do. Don&#39;t fret over &quot;what might happen&quot;, live in the present.</p>

<p>Edit: Imo, TPTB want people to feel hopeless; that makes it &quot;easier&quot; for them.</p>
