       G-l stated that when AC (the mom's partner) struck them with a spoon in Morocco, it is the only instance in which the mom's partner, AC, abused them. 
The fellow that puts out wideshut.co.uk blog has been hostile against the mom, her partner, the kids allegations, the advocate, since day one.  He's a member of the DI forum.

       You are welcome to sticky this post. I say that because the previous sticky was still garnering new info at the time of it's unsticky. There is obviously ongoing interest in this. And while I can't claim to be 100% fearless (riding my bike on dark, remote roads after binging on The Walking Dead gives me the heeby jeebies, I confess), I do have fewer points of potential leverage - "they" already ruined my life, leaving them little else with which to punish me.

       Well that would definitely undermine his narrative.  Wouldn't be too surprised if he got some sort of threat, though I'd think he would want it deleted instead of just unstickied if that were the case.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The mother reported the crime, and Barnet Police who interviewed them ordered medical examinations that confirmed sexual abuse and violence. The Police, however, closed the case as “no crime confirmed” without even considering the results of the medical forensics and investigating the case properly.
       </p>
       <p>
        A week after the crime had been reported, the children were taken into police custody and 6 days later for some unknown reasons retracted their allegations. They were held isolated “in care” by the Local Borough of Camden and since then Barnet.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Four months later the Local Authority still has not managed to provide evidence for the grounds on which they retain the children. There is obvious fabrication of facts against the mother and her then partner, gagging and bullying her, as well as generally unfair treatment in the courts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The two judges so far have covered similar cases: Judge Vera Mayer who was involved in the case of Melissa Laird transferred the case to Mrs Justice Anne Pauffley in the High Court who was involved with the Hollie Greig case.
       </p>
       <p>
        Private meetings between the Local Authority’s barrister and the Judge are going on behind the mother’s back, which violates the ‘Code Of Practice’ and, of course, indicates a certain common agenda between the Judge and the Local Authority.

       I've been a non-participant observer/commentator for so long that your question sounds a bit like Greek. "Noticing stuff"  (like this) is now about all I do (and have done for about 3 years). This post is now on the front page due to commenting and voting diligence (thanks to all for that). Perhaps other participants will search for those caches, since that isn't something I know about (I'm pushing 60 years old faster than I care to think about).

       a public utility and is privately owned. Reddit can scrub whatever they damn well want to and they don't need to apologize for it. Just saying.

       This is why I'm hoping for moderator input on this matter. Was it scrubbed by mods independent of admin intervention? Or, was it done by admin request? Or was it a direct admin action.

      <p>
       I don't trust any of them, but moderator input usually reveals hints.

        What’s concerning about this story is not that people wish to help two innocent children who may have been abused, but that they would so blindly believe and share anything and everything written about the case. That they would believe the videos completely and literally. That they would name names, single out locations, and plaster the videos themselves all over the web!
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there is certainly a debate to be had about the secret family courts and some of the practises of social services in this country, there are legitimate reasons why cases involving children, especially abuse, are restricted from public perusal.

       This ideology seems very concerned for the well-being of the children. However, it also seems to be a convenient explanation for a coverup. "Think of the children" has been [ab]used in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rational question I ask myself is: Who is being protected?
      </p>
      <p>
       Many "innocents" have become internet memes and survive to this day as healthy members of the internet era. One thing is for certain here: These children are victims; either victims of their father's abuse, or victims of their mother's extremely graphic coaching.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is the latter (mother's coaching), then their eagerness to participate in the conveyance of extremely graphic and detailed "falsehoods" against their father seems to lend some potential implication of a desire to be away from their father.. for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was going to write more about this, but mid-sentence, I've come to realize there is no way for the public to win, and the children lose either way.

       If something doesn't emerge from this post in a day or three, I'll have no choice but to let it go. I retired from techophilia more than 10 years ago and would never be able to "rebuild" it in any meaningful way. My hope (and I assume the hope of many who have taken an interest in this) is that someone will do just that - it just won't be me, because I don't have the technical ability any more.

       That said I do want to point out irony is the opposite of expectation. Such as a firehouse burning down. It's very
       <em>
        coincidental
       </em>
       what you're suggesting not ironic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I've never thought of this subreddit's userbase as dumb but the downvotes I'm receiving for asking for clarification are making me wonder.

       Picking at my word choice is a distraction. A subject being scrubbed from the internet, disappearing from the top of this sub within 1 day of my pointing out that it's being scrubbed may not fall precisly within the realm of "irony". Maybe "suspiciously coincidental" will pass your grammatic filter.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your misunderstanding, I'm not insinuating anything (check my other comments, specifically about that) other than what I've stated outright - it's... extremely curious that this post disappeared from view here
       <em>
        during
       </em>
       its subject matter's internet scrub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others have already stated their beliefs (with supporting documentation) that a coverup is in play. To me, it looks more like a burial.

        The internet scrubbing is active. It should go without saying that safe archiving of the recordings of these children is paramount. Backups are needed and, quite obviously, google can't be trusted.

      <p>
       I completely agree with you that subject matters such as these are not paid attention to but what I'm interested in is the actual scrubbing itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to assume that I'm just being an idiot right now and not understanding (forgive my username) something obvious. I'm not a novelty account. I believe
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       moderation is suspicious, or some of the moderators are at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess what I'm getting at is that I am curious if you could link me to something that indicates internet scrubbing activity (beyond the moderators removing a sticky) in reference to the post about the UK paedophile scandal.

       If you read the original post, linked in my post above (the second one), you'll see numerous instances if material being put up (posted somewhere on the internet and linked in the post or in comments below it) then taken down a day or two later. The instance which prompted me to post my comment (the first of my two links in my post above) was the takedown of the two google folders containing the interview videos of the children in which they gave their accounts. I hadn't finished watching them (I'd only watched a total of 3 videos out of about 10 - due to their disturbing nature, I wasn't able to just binge on the whole set and was intending to eventually watch them all, a little at a time - now I can't).

       If you read the original post, linked in my post above (the second one), you'll see numerous instances if material being put up (posted somewhere on the internet and linked in the post or in comments below it) then taken down a day or two later. The instance which prompted me to post my comment (the first of my two links in my post above) was the takedown of the two google folders containing the interview videos of the children in which they gave their accounts. I hadn't finished watching them (I'd only watched a total of 3 videos out of about 10 - due to their disturbing nature, I wasn't able to just binge on the whole set and was intending to eventually watch them all, a little at a time - now I can't).

       tl;dr: there's plenty of scrubbing evidence in the original post and comments.
