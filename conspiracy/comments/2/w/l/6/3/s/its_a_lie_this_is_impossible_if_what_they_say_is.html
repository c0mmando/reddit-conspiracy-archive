<p>This isn&#39;t true at all, and NASA claims footage to show the curvature of the earth... If what you&#39;re saying is true, you&#39;re debunking NASA right now. We have footage from NASA demonstrating a flat horizon and then a faked, curved horizon in the same footage. It&#39;s obvious when a fish eye lens is being used... With the eye, we know the flat horizon is the real one.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what i mean by fudged, optical trickery. Your theory is effectively that over 99% of cameras sent up there provided a rounded image of Earth due to their lenses. It&#39;s possible i guess, i have no idea, but this breaks so much knowledge it&#39;s a bit ridiculous. Where would the sun go at night for one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say a pretty good reason for longer travel times is the fact there are strong prevailing winds from the East or South East around the latitude of South Africa, so flying to Australia (East of Africa) will give you a headwind all the way. Flying North East a bit to Singapore and then down to Australia will give you a chance to refuel (from flying against the headwind, uses more fuel). Incidentally, the reason for these winds is also a consequence of a rotating, spherical Earth, on a still Earth winds would travel North/South due to pressure/temperature differences at the poles and equator, but the rotation of the Earth induces the Coriolis effect, deflecting the winds.</p>

<p>In response to some of your other points, I&#39;ve personally seen satellites being fitted and built, and later used data and photographs from these satellites, which in my book is pretty strong evidence for space being a thing (you know, aside from common sense, overwhelming scientific evidence, the fact we&#39;ve FUCKING BEEN TO SPACE). How would you explain GPS satellites? How about how we have pictures and information from other planets in the solar system from space probes? Or what about tides? </p>
