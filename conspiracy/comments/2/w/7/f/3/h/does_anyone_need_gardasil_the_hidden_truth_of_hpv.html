    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re going to talk about Gardasil, you should also talk about its effectiveness. Based on the extensive research my daughter did into it, it seems almost exactly as effective as not vaccinating. If a vaccine&#39;s effectiveness is pretty much zero, there&#39;s no point in considering it, so there&#39;s equally no point in worrying about its component parts and what they might or might not do.</p>

<p>Maybe the video said something about that?</p>

Yet it&#39;s not a requirement (or even a best practice) to test patients before administering the vaccine. At the very least, if people decide to get the vaccine, they should get tested first...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you give me a source for your vague generalization here, because there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;vaccines produce serious adverse effects in far less than 1% of the people who take them.&quot;</p>

<p>We are specifically talking about the HPV vaccine, which has plenty of safety issues, much higher adverse effect reporting, and its effectiveness is in question.</p>

<p>You guys always want to make this about all vaccines, but you&#39;re shifting the goalposts. It is absolutely legit to be okay with MMR and eschew HPV. That makes no one an &quot;anti-vaxer&quot; or &quot;anti-science.&quot; In fact, accepting that all vaccines given to you are perfect and wonderful without extensive testing is decidedly anti-science and anti-human health. It&#39;s pro-corporatist (but not really, in the long run, the corporations do get fucked if their products aren&#39;t safe, best to take your time and do it right). And Gardisil, ugh, that shit can be really dangerous, ask around...or do a few PubMed searches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DH, check out the concept of &quot;strain replacement.&quot;</p>

<p>Targeting only a handful of HPV strains via vaccination is causing the other strains to proliferate...the delicate balance nature has provided us has been disrupted.</p>

<p>Vaccine efficacy can be specious. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, scientists presume that certain “surrogate markers” or “precancerous lesions” precede cervical cancer. With the HPV vaccine, they simply compared the numbers of these markers in women who received the vaccine to the numbers of these markers in women who received the placebo. However, <em>no actual cases of cervical cancer were prevented in any of the test subjects in any of the clinical studies of the HPV vaccine.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The HPV vaccine was marketed deceptively as well when first introduced, being promoted as “100%” effective. However, the vaccine is only “100%” effective against two of numerous strains of HPV, not cervical cancer itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During prelicensure studies, 361 women who received at least one shot of Gardasil went on to develop precancerous lesions on their cervixes within three years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the report <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMe078060">HPV Vaccination – More Answers, More Questions</a>: “cautious approach may be warranted in light of important unanswered questions about overall vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and adverse effects that may emerge over time.”</p>

<p>In this 2007 report commissioned by the NEJM, two studies were considered on the vaccine&#39;s effectiveness on cervical cancer. The report asked: “In these trials, called Females United to Unilaterally Reduce Endo/Ectocervical Disease (FUTURE) I and II, what is the efficacy of vaccination among all subjects, regardless of causal HPV types?”</p>

<p>The results were not promising, as it was determined that in FUTURE I that the vaccine had an efficacy of only 20%, and this was only against low-risk lesions: “no efficacy was demonstrable for higher-grade disease, but the trial may have lacked adequate power to detect a difference.”</p>

<p>However, the larger FUTURE II had more conclusive, and even less favorable, results, as the vaccine was only 17% effective, and again had no impact on preventing high-risk lesions. The report mentions the obvious shortcomings of the vaccine: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another factor explaining the modest efficacy of the vaccine is the role of oncogenic HPV types not included in the vaccine. At least 15 oncogenic HPV types have been identified, so targeting only 2 types may not have had a great effect on overall rates of preinvasive lesions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This concept of “strain replacement” is not limited to the HPV vaccine, and is an extremely important aspect of the vaccine debate that deserves more attention. Miller continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gardasil is not the only vaccine that targets some strains of the disease while excluding others. The Hib and pneumococcal vaccines were also constructed in this manner, and have become problematic due to “strain replacement.” </p>

<p>Scientists have discovered that when vaccines only attack some strains of a disease, other strains gain prominence. The disease becomes more virulent and people who are normally not susceptible to the ailment are infected.</p>

<p>For example, there are several different types of haemophilus influenzae, including types a, b, c, d, e, and f. The “b” type is just one strain—the only one for which a vaccine was created—the Hib shot. Although this vaccine appears to have decreased cases of haemophilus influenzae type b in children, <em>the overall rate of invasive haemophilus influenzae disease in adults increased.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Researchers don&#39;t consider this a failing of the Hib vaccine, rather <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17304452">“it raises the question whether a [new] vaccine will need to be developed.”</a></p>

<p>Prevnar, the pneumococcal vaccine, is only designed to protect against a few of the 90 different strains that can cause the disease. The vaccine is therefore still considered “effective” if the child is stricken with pneumococcus...just not from one of the strains included in the vaccine.</p>

<p>The <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> and the <em>Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal</em> have both published data demonstrating that non-vaccine strains of pneumococcus are replacing the strains targeting by the vaccine. What&#39;s even more concerning is the new strains are more dangerous and drug-resistant. According to the study <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3416489/">Pediatric Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in the United States in the Era of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Through the widespread use of PCV7 in the United States, there has been a significant decrease in the incidence of IPD and nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotypes in all age groups. <em>However, the emergence of replacement pneumococcal serotypes (e.g., 19A, 1, 5, 15, and 33) is now having a significant impact on the success of PCV7.</em> </p>

<p>These serotypes have become the most common causes of IPD in infants, children, and adults, with serotype 19A having emerged as the predominant replacement serotype associated with multidrug-resistant infections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am aware that Gardasil does not protect from all strains of HPV. It does, however, protect against most of the most dangerous ones. If this causes less-dangerous strains to become more common amongst HPV-carriers, that is probably actually a good thing, as the various strains compete with one another and actually themselves provide protection from getting other strains.  </p>

<p>I am also aware that there was some BS in getting Gardasil initially approved as well as in the marketing of it. As I have said before, however, that is a problem with our corrupt economic and political systems, not with the medical technology itself. Numerous studies have since shown Gardasil to be safe and effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, it&#39;s really something when Merck&#39;s own doctors have gotten crisis of conscience and turned on them over it (over 6 years ago)...glad we have whistleblowers so that the observant can take note and countries outside the US that have raised the flag on it, but still a disservice to the general public who are kept in the dark. I wonder if that&#39;s why we have so few whistleblowers, because they see how little previous light-shiners have been able to change safety standards in the industry due to push-back from the very agencies that are supposed to be pushing for safety.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a really good Judicial Watch Report, from way back in <em>2008,</em> that deep-dives into its issues and its inadequate testing: <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/documents/2008/JWReportFDAhpvVaccineRecords.pdf">http://www.judicialwatch.org/documents/2008/JWReportFDAhpvVaccineRecords.pdf</a> (PDF)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you frame the entire discussion as &quot;vaxxer vs. anti-vaxxer&quot; then you&#39;ve already lost.  That&#39;s an incredibly narrow-minded and unscientific way to examine vaccine safety and efficacy.</p>

<p>But if you&#39;re going to use the term, define it.  When you say &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot; what, specifically, do you mean?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also pretty clear you&#39;ve never spent more than 5 minutes learning about Gardasil (which has been proven ineffective and physically harmful).</p>
