<blockquote>
<p>In January 2015 a US medical practitioner of many years experience was prevented from touring Australia and speaking publicly about the medical literature on vaccines. </p>

<p>Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, was due to speak in venues in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide at pre-booked venues that had been publicised months in advance. </p>

<p>Yet on 27 January 2015 <a href="http://gumshoenews.com/2015/02/02/dr-sherri-tenpenny-bound-for-botany-bay-until/">she cancelled her tour</a> citing concern for her safety and those attending. </p>

<p>Most venues had cancelled her talks because pro-vaccine lobby groups (many of whom are promoting industry interests) threatened their livelihood. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-07/who-is-anti-vaccination-campaigner-sherri-tenpenny/6004490">Pro-vaccine lobby groups</a> are claiming that a debate of the medical literature on vaccines <em>&quot;is a danger to public health&quot;.</em></p>

<p>Yet it is a debate of the medical literature, evidence-based medicine, that is necessary to protect public health. The medical literature should not be removed from the debate because it informs the public of the risks of vaccines - all the science needs to be debated. </p>

<p>And the debate should not be framed as pro or anti-vaccination - it is only the media that is framing it this way. Informed choice is about debating all the science in the medical literature</p>

<p>Why is the Australian public being prevented by the media and pro-vaccine lobby groups from seeing all the medical literature on vaccines? </p>

<p>Science is about scrutiny of the evidence, not selective evidence, yet Australian journalists have been informed by the Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) that they <a href="http://vaccinationdecisions.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ACMA-Final-Report-2976-May-2013.pdf">do not have to present</a> (pdf) the other side of the vaccination debate. </p>

<p>How can population health be protected if all the science is not being presented to make an informed choice? </p>

<p><a href="http://vaccinationdecisions.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/5754-Health-PosterA4_no-logo.pdf">Here is the science</a> (pdf) that is being left out of the vaccination debate. </p>

<p>Public health is at risk if the government is developing public health policies on selective science controlled by lobby groups.</p>

<p>Australian state and federal legislation is infringing on freedom of speech, association and peaceful protests in Australia and a Melbourne Human Rights Lawyer, Emily Howe, <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/02/04/australia-urged-remove-restrictions-rights">has discussed these concerns</a> that are currently in a report before the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.</p>

<h2>HPV Vaccine</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2011 I asked the Australian public health authorities <a href="http://vaccinationdecisions.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/OpenletterProfStanleyandTGA2011.pdf">why</a> (pdf) sodium borate and polysorbate 80 are found in the HPV vaccine? These ingredients are known to cause infertility in laboratory animals.</p>

<p>The Australian regulatory board for vaccines did not provide an answer to this question. </p>

<p>The aluminium adjuvant found in HPV vaccines is also linked to causing neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases yet in December 2014 <a href="http://aapnews.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/12/11/aapnews.20141211-1">the FDA approved</a> a new HPV vaccine that contains double the amount of aluminium adjuvant as the current HPV vaccine. </p>

<p>The current HPV vaccines <a href="http://sanevax.org/">have been linked to thousands of serious adverse events</a> and adolescents will now be receiving 1,500 mcg of aluminium adjuvant from 3 doses of the new HPV vaccine if it is approved in Australian school vaccination programs. </p>

<p><em>This amount of aluminium has never been tested in long-term studies of children&#39;s health.</em></p>

<p>The World Health Organisation states that Pap screening is the safest and most effective method of detecting and preventing cervical cancer in women.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>HPV Vaccines and Fertility</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Deirdre Little, an Obstetrician in NSW Australia, reveals that HPV vaccines have never been tested in animal studies for the effects on the reproductive system before they were implemented in global vaccination programs targeting adolescents. </p>

<p>The information that she presents <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=CoWUSuGCo-I#t=531">in her video presentation</a> was published in the British Medical Journal in 2012 and she describes the lack of safety and efficacy known about HPV vaccines before they were introduced. </p>

<p>The lack of animal studies done on this vaccine is significant because it is necessary to test vaccines in animals to understand the possible adverse events that might occur in humans. </p>

<p>This is particularly the case for determining the long-term safety of the vaccines in humans and specifically the effects on the human reproductive organs and fertility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I love your posts and efforts in trying to wake the masses, in the US and here downunder :) </p>

<p>Sadly Australians have their heads in the sand regarding this topic and many other important issues. </p>

<p>We do NOT want to have informed opinions, we want to be spoon fed biased limited news. </p>

<p>We watch shit like Today Tonight FFS and think it&#39;s real. We worry about the lives of actors on Home and Away whilst the health of our families is compromised through our shitty lifestyles, food choices and obsessions with distractions (TV, sport etc). </p>

<p>We are a fairly &#39;dumbed down&#39; nation and people such as Dr. Tenpenny are not welcome as they open peoples eyes to what is going on. </p>

<p>That is just not acceptable.</p>

<p>edit: I am new to this kind of social media hence the lack of links etc. Is just MY opinion :)</p>
