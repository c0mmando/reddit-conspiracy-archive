       I'm sure I'm not the only person who has posted a FB status about chemtrails or brought up how 9/11 was clearly an inside job to a friend, only to experience immediate backlash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me:  "But think about physics, a building doesn't just fall at free-fall speed.  Look how the columns were cut."

       Educated people suddenly become idiots.  The idea that our government (or rich trillionaire bankers) did this, would unmake their existence.  How could they enjoy the news that Spider-Man will now be in the Marvel universe if everything they knew was actually a lie?
      </p>
      <p>
       People just don't wan't to know.  This post is to get some insight on how to get awareness out there.  We live in the information age.  For every real article, there are ten fake articles.  How do we deal with a growing majority of people that are.... I guess, simply comfortable being sheep?

       What do you do when you're trying to lead a horse to water and they don't want to?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they don't know they are thirsty - fuck 'em. Don't waste your time proselytizing to those who do not wish to listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something must have happened in
       <em>
        your life
       </em>
       to wake you up, or which lead you to wake up. Sadly, this did not happen to them, and they don't know they're thirsty. Some day they will. Just be there with something to drink and a reassuring hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did my research on my own and had to deal with it on my own. My new mission is not to wake people up but to guide those that want to listen and improve my circumstances and my community the best way I can. Must better use of your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to say it, but 2/3s of the reddit standby response are totally appropriate: delete Facebook, hit up the gym. And make some noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they want to listen, hit 'em in the mouth. Otherwise Downvote &amp; Move Onâ„¢ IRL.
      </p>

       I hope that helps.

       Thanks for the reply.  It makes perfect sense; you can't make someone care about something the don't care about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always thought too much.  I lost my religion when I was seven when I found all of my toys (from Santa) in a cabinet my Mom told me never to go into.  It was a very quick domino effect that I remember to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well if Santa isn't real, then is the tooth fairy real?  The Easter Bunny can't be real.  Well, I guess God isn't real either."
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a lot of disenchantment to deal with all at once.  I've always thought outside the box.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is weird is that people find it to be unsettling when they find out someone doesn't have a Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it is comforting to know that others are awake.

       agree...The better you are doing at living your life the more people you will find that actually want/ask to hear what you say on different topics. If you are the smartest guy in the world but have no visible life achievements then people really really won't want to hear it from you.

       Be compassionate and humble and avoid starting arguments you know you will win. No-one likes a smartarse. Its almost like cracking a nut with a sledgehammer arguing with someone when you are armed with the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it best to suggest alternative perspectives to to their opinions and elaborate only when necessary and try to help them think critically and practice open mindedness. Only when they are receptive to other perspectives can\will they change their belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they allow the 1st domino to fall they may start questioning everything and awaken in their own time. 
The biggest problem with the general population (sorry for this generalisation) is that most people will do anything to prevent that 1st domino from falling due to denial and willful ignorance. Telling these people anything controversial or against the grain will be like sandpaper on their brain although it will fester in the background until they address it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be confident and informed as its a lonely world IRL when you stand alone voicing your opinion in a sea of opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ostracised in your workplace for your views is another possibility so tread carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if this sounds like a lecture. Its just things I've learned while dealing with these people. Hope it helps and I hope I've understood your post.

       Your damn right that first domino hurts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hurts like a 47 story skyscraper falling at near-free fall speed despite only office fire damage and minimum structural damage from the first two steel-framed buildings who collapsed due to fires that day (first time in history), making it the third in history (and the only 3 that I am aware of).
      </p>

       Once it falls though - there's no going back. This allusion works on both metaphors. ;)

       The other day I tried to post that Hilary Clinton was unconstitutional for alluding to gun owners being terrorists.  My girlfriend lost her shit over it.

      <p>
       Her response:  "I just kind of scares me that my boyfriend cares so much about the second amendment."

       I'm not a gun owner, but I believe that Americans have a right to bear arms.

       In the past, I have started arguments and I looked like an ass for it.  I would get annoyed with people for being stupid (willfully ignorant).  Everything that you have said makes sense.

       I hear you. I,m Scottish but am aware of the right to bear arms. Didn't the founding fathers of America write that into the constitution for the main purpose of being able to protect yourself from tyrannical government?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have arguments with people all the time that question my beliefs. I feel like an alien on a strange planet sonetimes. I'd be as well being for the sense I make to these people. Had it all.....weirdo, conspiracy theorist, blah blah. Now and again I do lose it and unleash a torrent of facts that I know will rock them, but only if they really deserve it. Feel guilty after it though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read and read and read for about 6 years now on stuff like chemtrails, money, 911, vaccines ruling elite etc. Its a tough road at 1st but then everything makes sense and falls into place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay strong.  They say opinions are like arseholes. Everyone has one. 
They just see us as the arseholes with an opinion they don't agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't eat wheat. I inhale colloidal silver. I haven't vaccinated my child. Don't drink tap water.....its a lonely road but the more I've travelled it the stronger and confident I've become and am glad I've chose it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One good thing. Keep chipping away because more and more and more people are waking up all the time. People you have arguments will come back 2-3 years down the line and try to take your previous position in the argument and try to use it against you. ....funny how the mind works. :)

       There are argubaly several reasons, but thats a big one. I believe the original idea was to not have a standing army on our soils, and instead have militias made up of every citizen who are armed. This would foil a foreign invasion as well as allow the people to regain their voice should tyranny take over.

       If they prefer to remain closed off, let them. We have no right to force our beliefs upon anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, i personally "train" them in other ways (not their thoughts or beliefs, but their preparedness.)
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, my wife never was big about this stuff. So, i backed off. Instead, ive been teaching her survival skills, and explaining to her that if something happens, this is what we do. Does it matter what thst something is? Not really. The fundamentals are still there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slowly but surely, she began to notice things in our local government after she took up a job with them. She would come to me asking how some shit is possible, and how people can get away with it, even when caught red handed.

       Playing coy, i told her thst i didnt know, but to look at who they hang out with, who are their friends, who are their family, etc. She noticed that all the corruption is tied together. Its all done by the same team of people, and i explained to her thst this is nepotism, as those in question appoint eachothet for high positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       More and more questions, and more and more discoveries, she has come to her own conclusion about the federal government, and we can now talk about these things (but limited to some extent).

       With the media we have and the expectations society has of us, it has kind of deteriorated our ability to think critically. The media does not ask hard questions, so neither do we. I think we have to learn how to communicate like people again and not use what we see in the media as a way to convey our messages.

       Well consider how many people come here instead of r/science, r/environment, etc to discuss things better suited for those subs. People want to surround themselves with others that agree, whether or not that lines up with facts or reality.

       That's all good going to the science sub when we know science textbooks that the medical profession use and teach with, are written by big pharma to push drugs and equipment for treating symptoms and occasional cures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel I'm purposefully made Ill by a number of environmental factors then told to go to a doctor for treatment.

      <p>
       If I took my anecdotal evidence to the science sub I'd be told "r/conspiracy is that way".

You just keep taking those pills. We,re both happy that way.

       You go and have a think about environmental factors that's could possibly harm you from moment of inception to death and we'll see where we're at. (Remember things that could harm a human in their environment - to avoid confusion).

       Go ahead and elaborate. Thats the only way to have discourse, if we all open up to eachother. U/drytruth may believe differently, which is okay. But he might have some valuable input on this subject. Theres only one way to see..

       Thanks for the reply.  It makes perfect sense; you can't make someone care about something the don't care about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always thought too much.  I lost my religion when I was seven when I found all of my toys (from Santa) in a cabinet my Mom told me never to go into.  It was a very quick domino effect that I remember to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well if Santa isn't real, then is the tooth fairy real?  The Easter Bunny can't be real.  Well, I guess God isn't real either."
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a lot of disenchantment to deal with all at once.  I've always thought outside the box.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is weird is that people find it to be unsettling when they find out someone doesn't have a Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it is comforting to know that others are awake.

       agree...The better you are doing at living your life the more people you will find that actually want/ask to hear what you say on different topics. If you are the smartest guy in the world but have no visible life achievements then people really really won't want to hear it from you.
