        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Edit: This issue has become incredibly divisive as new information has been released. Almost everyone in this story has been accused of something horrific by now. It is a mess. The new revelations (the kids&#39; retractions and emerging information about one of their guardians) will take time to digest. I hope there is more discussion, I hope it can be about the facts and I hope it can be civil. I admit, I have no clear idea on exactly what has transpired, and I think that anyone who is being completely honest with themselves will have to say the same at this point. Hopefully things will become clearer soon. In the meantime, let&#39;s all remember that whatever you personally believe about this case, the most important thing here is the children.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to link to the leaked judicial documents for legal reasons. Videos of the police interviews with the children appear to no longer be available online. </p>

<p>Here is a witness statement by retired police constable K. Wilson, who apparently had access to parts of the police report some time ago:
&quot;To state categorically that the children had been coached (which is written on the Crime Report) which I understand is the assertion from Social Services, is simply not feasible.
Some investigation has been conducted into proving or disproving, however most appear to be slanted towards merely disproving the offences occurred [...]
This investigation does not look at the fact that the children are giving accounts of abuse and how they came to use such language other than to suggest Mr Christie coached the children.
Other named suspects who are professionals were not formally interviewed.
Investigators should not make assumptions that due to the unlikely or seemingly ridiculous nature of the allegation that it is untrue. If an account appears to be untrue corroboration should be sought for this also. I do not feel it was suitable to close this investigation at this point without further enquiries and corroboration being sought.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is a recent article on the matter with updated info <a href="http://wideshut.co.uk/judicial-review-hampstead-abuse-allegations-reveal-coaching-likely/">see here</a></p>

<p>All the youtube videos with the kids&#39; original allegations have been taken down from the internet. </p>

<p>Interview with Sabine McNeill - the campaigner and friend of the Mother. McNeill has fled the country. She is German but her English is great. She is giving an interview from Germany and gives a ton of background info. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRzL5G9d0wA">see here</a></p>

<p>A story of a teacher in Hampstead who was able to walk free after sexually assaulting a nine year old girl. <a href="http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/crime-court/hampstead_teacher_walks_free_after_sexually_abusing_nine_year_old_girl_1_1669170">see here</a></p>

<p>A story of a Catholic Friar in Hampstead who was freed (and was told he can continue working in the Church) after being caught with 5000+ pictures of child abuse (some graded in the most extreme categories of child abuse). From the article: &quot;The prosecution also brought up Gardner’s password to his computer account – described by the judge as “so revolting” that it should not be read out in court. ...Gardner admitted 10 counts of making indecent images and one count of possession of prohibited images of children.&quot; <a href="http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/../catholic_friar_caught_with_sexual_image_of_dog_and_child_could_return_to_camden_church_1_3518921">see here</a></p>

<p>A radio show with Clyde Lewis. It has some great info in there, especially when he talks to Ed Opperman (who is very knowledgeable and seems pretty legit. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/groundzeromedia/f2015-02-11">see here</a></p>

<p>A somewhat mainstream article about the whole case, with a mainstream perspective (protecting the status quo), but which does at least confirm some elements of the story. <a href="http://wideshut.co.uk/hampstead-abuse-allegations-court-seeks-removal-videos-campaigner-flees/">see here</a></p>

<p>Mainstream press link confirming elements of the story <a href="http://downloads.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/default.aspx?id=5567710&amp;guid=9eaa536b-f4f9-48b3-8c04-80d751b874b8">here</a></p>

<p>More information on the Aangirfan blog <a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/satanic-child-abuse-in-hampstead.html?m=1">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are many of us who give credence to the original testimonies of the children, as there are plenty of seemingly credible stories of children being abused in satanic rituals. Famous (deceased) UK pedo, Jimmy Savile, apparently abused children during satanic rituals - <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/370439/Jimmy-Savile-was-part-of-satanic-ring">see here</a> and <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/371936/I-was-raped-at-13-by-Jimmy-Savile-in-satanist-ritual">here</a>. 
And Cyril Smith was no stranger to Satanism either. <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/pervert-mp-cyril-smith-pals-1546290">see here</a></p>

<p>Also, there have been several, well reported, cases of police and authorities covering up for pedophiles in the UK... Like <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/10389041/How-far-did-police-go-to-protect-Jimmy-Savile.html">Jimmy Savile</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2602802/How-Liberal-party-police-MI5-concealed-MP-Cyril-Smiths-industrial-scale-child-abuse.html">Cyril Smith</a> and the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2939129/Two-local-councillors-corrupt-police-officer-accused-having-sex-victims-Rotherham-abuse-scandal.html">Rotherham rape gangs</a>. The problem appears to be endemic, and it therefore makes it impossible to trust or rely on the police in these matters. And just a quick google search of UK care home child abuse scandals will illustrate how the social services cannot be trusted either. </p>

<p>The UK establishment appears to be awash with sexual child abuse and cover-ups. You can see over 100 articles from the mainstream press over the last couple of years about establishment child abuse <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2boqzq/the_breaking_uk_vip_paedophile_scandal_what_we/">here</a> </p>

<p>F = Finbar A = Alisa</p>

<p>F: Don’t worry so the police that interviewed you told the other police? The, the police that were hurting you?</p>

<p>A: mmm (nods) My mum says that they didn’t interview my mum or Papa Ham(?) they only interviewed me and Gabriel when they should take like, like, the stamps and all kinds of stuff from my mum and Abraham for..</p>

<p>F: But the policeman that interviewed you yesterday has told the policeman…?</p>

<p>A: Why do you think there helping them?</p>

<p>F: (laughs) They’re not really helping them, well we know that, we know that, but it’s it’s part of the standard procedure you have to tell the police what’s happening.</p>

<p>A: Gabriel took…. the police to a place where we regularly go to do sex because my father does not have his own house</p>

<p>F: Right</p>

<p>A: He just goes and lives with Mr Hollings or Mrs Forsdyke</p>

<p>F: Right… but you found that house then yeah?</p>

<p>A: Uhuh</p>

<p>F: What about the babies skulls/ did you find the babies skulls?</p>

<p>A: No</p>

<p>F: You went searching for them? You didn&#39;t have a search warrant?</p>

<p>A: The police wanted to, to search in, they wanted to go to church today but… well Papa Ham he’s telling them to go tomorrow because tomorrows the sex day.</p>

<p>F: Well sooner its ha..the sooner we get them sorted out the better…..you know</p>

<p>A: The police, they don’t want to go tomorrow</p>

<p>F: What was the name of the priest? Father?</p>

<p>A: Father Paul</p>

<p>F: Was he a nasty piece of work?</p>

<p>A: (nods) and he’s fat</p>

<p>F: Fat as well? My goodness….very strange and Cafcass that’s another thing thats…?</p>

<p>A: Social Services, the GP, the Doctors…</p>

<p>F: They know about it?</p>

<p>A: Solicitor</p>

<p>F: They all in on it?</p>

<p>A: (nods head) uhuh</p>

<p>F: They do sex? they all do it? They all do sex? You’re talking about a major sex cult here, you know that? (Dog barks) oi shut up, that dogs nuts you know</p>

<p>A: That’s how she distracts, she’ll bark til we let her go too, that’s what we do when we, because we were eating here, she was barking and after mum was going to let her go off and Papa Ham said she&#39;s distracting no need to let her off the lead.</p>

<p>F: Oh, so you were saying your grandmothers in on it as well? Your father’s mother. Or?</p>

<p>A: Yes my father’s mother and my father’s grandmother.</p>

<p>F: They’re all in on it? Goodness me.</p>

<p>A: Yes well do you know papas family well RD’s family.</p>

<p>F: RD, yeah yeah, he’s gonna run, they’re like, they’re gonna be like cockroaches scuttling for a rock to hide under. But there aint gonna be no rocks cos were gonna make sure there’s no rocks for them to hide under.</p>

<p>A: They’re like rabbits trying to get in a hole when there’s a fox.</p>

<p>F: Rabbits are nice little creatures. They are more like cockroaches than they’re like rabbits, you know….Very worrying that the police and the priests are in on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>F: He feels it? He just suspects, he suspects that theres something going on?</p>

<p>A: Because it’s like, if they did know they would have been in action they would have helped. Well they would have been in jail by now because they said on Monday, or Sunday or Monday they’ll get arrested.</p>

<p>F: Mad…What day is it today? Is it the 9th of September.</p>

<p>A: Today is now Tuesday.</p>

<p>F: Tuesday the 9th of September?</p>

<p>A: And I said to you yesterday they had to be arrested already?</p>

<p>F: So it’s Tuesday the 9th? Wait is it the 8th or the 9th?</p>

<p>A: No today is the 9th</p>

<p>F: Today is the 9th of September 2014</p>

<p>A: Saturday was the 8th</p>

<p>F: Saturday was the 8th, yeah yeah yeah yesterday was the 8th</p>

<p>A: No it was the 6th</p>

<p>F: Oh right</p>

<p>A: It was the 6th and now it’s the 9th.</p>

<p>F: So its 15;58. It’s almost 4 o’clock in the afternoon. 9th of September 2014. Very strange. We never believed, we never believed the children, we never believed .</p>

<p>A: And the children, there’s some children like doing it</p>

<p>F: Is there really?</p>

<p>A: Yes, er, Sophie and she’s a girl and she likes it. She’s got blonde hair.</p>

<p>F: How old is she.</p>

<p>A: The same age….she’s only 8 years old.</p>

<p>F: Wow, but she enjoys it?</p>

<p>A: Yes she likes it.</p>

<p>F: Is her parents into it as well?</p>

<p>A: Yes and she likes to do sex.</p>

<p>F: Right, and she’s 8 years old? That’s just….</p>

<p>A: And she gets a lot of sweets for this.</p>

<p>F: How much money do they get?</p>

<p>A: Oh a lot.</p>

<p>F: And do they charge for it as well? They charge… They charge for it as well don’t they?</p>

<p>A: Yes.</p>

<p>F: How much do they charge?</p>

<p>A: Like 1 thousand pounds, like, it looks like 1 thousand pounds a week they get or maybe 2. Maybe it’s a million pounds a week, like 50 pounds every single day in a whole year, 365 days.</p>

<p>F: Comes to a lot of money, yeah?</p>

<p>A: No that’s a lot of money like there’s no such thing as a number.</p>

<p>F: The number doesn’t mean anything, what you’re talking about these childrens suffering here you know.</p>

<p>A: Every year there’s, yes, 365 babies suffering every year, 1 a day.</p>

<p>F: 365, probably more if you multiply it by the rest of the country. This is… you remember? Its very strange……have you drank blood, have you drank blood?</p>

<p>A: Yes, tastes like metal</p>

<p>F: Tastes like metal….who knows</p>

<p>A: But I don’t like the taste</p>

<p>F: Well you’re vegetarian, you’re vegan</p>

<p>A: It’s a weird taste</p>

<p>F: They made you eat flesh as well? Babies flesh?</p>

<p>A: Yes flesh</p>

<p>F: Was it babies flesh?</p>

<p>A: Yes baby flesh and meat and normal animal flesh
like chicken and beef</p>

<p>F: Right. Why do they cut the heads off the babies?</p>

<p>A: They hang it upside down and after this a big white bowl under. And after They cut, they don’t, don’t cut the head off so it falls on the floor they leave it on, they cut off the head but then it’s still on its just hanging on and the blood drips in. if there’s blood spilled on the floor or anything or blood splattered anywhere they get mops.</p>

<p>F: They don’t like to leave a mess.</p>

<p>A: They don’t want to no. No, no they would like to leave the mess but they know that just in case if maybe one of the children will tell a police or something.</p>

<p>F: Right. Well listen everything’s going to be alright. Everything’s gonna be alright it’s gonna change now.</p>

<p>A: But that’s why. That’s’ why the paper, when we had the school discos that’s why our sheet of paper said ‘no parents are allowed to be in the school disco’ but that was only the 1 page the only piece of paper that my mum had. Everyone else it didn’t have ‘parents are not allowed’ it says ‘parents are welcome to come’.</p>

<p>F: Because they are involed?</p>

<p>A: They are involved.</p>

<p>F: They’re involved.</p>

<p>A: And mother, she is not involved so it says ‘parents are not allowed’ the parents just have to drop off the child and go.</p>

<p>F: Wow.</p>

<p>A: That’s what kind of trick they is.</p>

<p>F: What about the secret language? What about the secret language that they use.</p>

<p>A: Yes.</p>

<p>F: Tell me about that.</p>

<p>A: They use it to, the teachers they use it, all of them use it.</p>

<p>F: What’s the secret language?</p>

<p>A: Acting.</p>

<p>F: Tell me? show me?</p>

<p>A: So as I said this aggressive move, that Yazzy(?) said was aggressive yesterday (pushes head and neck forwards).</p>

<p>F: Go on show me.</p>

<p>A: And this one, this one is like, um , like a fright one (arms held low with hands together in front of abdomen, fingers interlinked).</p>

<p>F: Right.</p>

<p>A: But this one (pulls head and neck back holding hands clasped to the chest) means like there’s, that someone my mum knows or like somebody who knows that who doesn&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>F: Somebody’s clocked? That’s right.</p>

<p>A: And that means that will alert them.</p>

<p>F: What about, what about.</p>

<p>A: Because yesterday the lady that we know she was one of them she was just walking, she was spying on us .</p>

<p>F: Ok.</p>

<p>A: Because that is her job to spy on us.</p>

<p>F: Right, right, right</p>

<p>A: She was spying in us and then after I was like, I was close about alerting her that I told I was really close I was like ‘Um Dad..’ but then I realised if I do I’ll actually get killed then</p>

<p>F: That’s right</p>

<p>A: And after I tried not to but I didn’t so I kept my hand like that (holds arms straight down) but I did do this one (chin tucked down arms extended down in front of body, fists clenched held in front near groin) which means touch.</p>

<p>F: Touch? What about the one where you wiggle your arse?</p>

<p>A: Yes that, that means touch quickly, like right this moment.</p>

<p>F: Well all them things are gonna to stop now.</p>

<p>A: But they’re all going to be took to court only if the police are helpful.</p>

<p>F: That’s right. Do you know how many children you have saved because of your bravery?</p>

<p>A: Two Hundred?</p>

<p>F: No but that’s only today that’s only, I mean in the future? If we can stop these people, You do realise that you&#39;ve.</p>

<p>A: A lot</p>

<p>F: A lot</p>

<p>A: But they..no not two hundred, all schools. I don’t know how many teachers there are in, school children are in schools?</p>

<p>F: How many schools are involved?</p>

<p>A: Like all Hampstead ones all the Hampstead area, all.</p>

<p>F: How many of the priests are involved.</p>

<p>A: Highgate….Maybe about, maybe about twenty something like that but it’s a lot, lot of priests. It seems a lot but it’s not much.</p>

<p>F: What’s the name of the church?</p>

<p>A: Christ Church.</p>

<p>F: Hampstead?</p>

<p>A: Christ Church Primary School, that’s what our church…</p>

<p>F: And the name of the priest that’s involved?</p>

<p>A: Yes Father Paul.</p>

<p>F: Paul Who.</p>

<p>A: Father Paul, his names Father Paul we call him Father Paul.</p>

<p>F: Don’t know his second name no?</p>

<p>A: No. but his real name is Father Paul. Well it’s not his real name that’s what the children call him.</p>

<p>F: Is he a bad, does he hurt you?</p>

<p>A: Yes, a lot.</p>

<p>F: Right.</p>

<p>A: And Mr Morris, this big guy who is the child taker, not child taker, child carer.</p>

<p>F: Right.</p>

<p>A: Yes? Well he works so he sweeps up the floor in school. Well he a worker so he locks up the school gates. So when everyone has left he locks up the gates all kind of stuff like that. He’s got the keys to lock up the school.</p>

<p>F: Right.</p>

<p>A: That’s why.</p>

<p>F: And does Father Paul hurt the girls or the boys?</p>

<p>A: The girls he likes the girls.</p>

<p>F: He doesn’t like boys?</p>

<p>A: Well he does like boys but not like, as much as the girls because they’re much easier. They don’t scream a lot because there are more girls liking it than boys.</p>

<p>F: Right, quite bizarre, oh there’s mummy. Let’s go and see mummy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is right. There are 19 videos of the kids telling a consistent story. And by the police you have on two days the kids telling the same story. Then they went to a special doctor and six days later they retracted the whole story and had an excuse for every question the police man asked and papa Ham (Abraham) became the bad guy.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why and how did they get the kids simultaneously to retract the story if they said before that only pain and punishment would help to say otherwise?</li>
<li>Why was the police man already aware of the changed story?</li>
<li>How come the kids had both nightmares in foster care?</li>
<li>How come Alisa knew police men by name and do those police men exist who she said before that they were part of the occult?</li>
<li>How come the Zorro narrative does not add up at all?</li>
<li>Why would the kids make up so much people involved if Abraham was trying to frame only a few?</li>
<li>Why did they end the interview after they got the first retraction out of them?</li>
<li>Why is there no footage of the transition between 11th and 17th?</li>
</ol>

<p>This is getting stranger by the minute. The only way we will know if this is true or not is by examining the privates of the teachers by trusted entities and have a criminal investigation started. We have two contradicting stories and only one can be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been suggested that this is all just a lie. The mother wants to lie her way into custody of the children. So why did she involve the school, the teachers, the McDonalds worker, and all the rest when this is only to target the father? Apparently the children have been found with signs of sexual abuse. The best she really could have done if she were trying to construct a lie would, clearly, be to accuse the father of abuse, back up with the marks, and leave it at that. She would not have needed to say any more. I honestly don&#39;t see how &quot;accuse the teachers, too&quot; would ever come up in her mind if she were just targeting the husband. What cause would she have to remove her son from the school? </p>

<p>Why would the mother publish hoax videos about teacher&#39;s birthmarks? What&#39;s up with that? It would be so easy for a teacher to just show everyone that there&#39;s no Satan down there and discount the whole tale. Why even publish that, under any circumstance, unless it is honest truth? </p>

<p>I&#39;m okay with not setting the precedent of school officials disrobing every time a parent wants to construct a tale. This will either make its way through the courts or it won&#39;t. I&#39;m betting on &quot;won&#39;t&quot; because it sounds absurd.</p>

I have been saying this for the longest, there are and always will be pedophile rings in high levels of government, Hollywood, churches etc. If we could somehow track these fuckers down and make them pay I would gladly risk my life to make sure they suffer and pay for what they have done.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m watching the police videos and am completely sickened. If you want to see what a child behaves likes after she&#39;s been coached, the last 2 videos where Alisa recants her story it is <em>very</em> obvious. She can&#39;t keep her story straight as to why she made up those lies about cutting babies heads off. When she talks about going to the doctor for examination, she says &quot;I was hoping the doctor wouldn&#39;t find scars so I wouldn&#39;t get in trouble.&quot; In the recant videos she is very un-enthused, whereas in the videos where she tells the stories of her abusers, she seems enthusiastic about telling the truth and getting this secret off her chest. She doesn&#39;t like lying, and she seems exhausted from the coaching she received to recant the story. Amazing.</p>

<p>Even more obvious is the video of Gabriel recanting. It&#39;s as if the interrogator is trying to get him to say it the way he was coached to say it, and Gabriel isn&#39;t following the program.</p>

<p>So, between 9/11/14 and 9/17/14 when they recant, someone trained them to recant their story. Who were they with during this time period? Who&#39;s care were they in? From what I&#39;ve read, it wasn&#39;t either of the parents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is possibly the most damning document of all. </p>

<p>That and a witness statement by retired police constable K. Wilson, who apparently had access to parts of the police report:</p>

<p>&quot;To state categorically that the children had been coached (which is written on the Crime Report) which I understand is the assertion from Social Services, is simply not feasible. </p>

<p>Some investigation has been conducted into proving or disproving, however most appear to be slanted towards merely disproving the offences occurred [...] </p>

<p>This investigation does not look at the fact that the children are giving accounts of abuse and how they came to use such language other than to suggest Mr Christie coached the children. </p>

<p>Other named suspects who are professionals were not formally interviewed. </p>

<p>Investigators should not make assumptions that due to the unlikely or seemingly ridiculous nature of the allegation that it is untrue. If an account appears to be untrue corroboration should be sought for this also. </p>

<p>I do not feel it was suitable to close this investigation at this point without further enquiries and corroboration being sought.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel your pain. In fact, I bear the pain of knowing this has been going on for ... thousands of years. The rituals, accompanied by human sacrifices are way more common than we are let to know. This is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>About 6 months ago, a local cop here (Montreal) came out to denounce the fact that some religious premises where &quot;out of bound&quot; and investigations were dropped without reason when some specific religious  <em>cough</em> catholic <em>cough</em>  organisations were involved.</p>

<p>Internet is a game changer though, if just ONE case gets blown open full public, the church will have one hell of a PR operation on their hands. This case may have the potential to do just that. I hope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! The one that that makes this era different from all else, is the internet. By using the internet, the human race finally has a way to organize against seemingly invisible or invulnerable groups of people.</p>

<p>This is the only time in history when we will stand a chance. Soon, blanket censorship will be the norm and small communities such as this one will be scattered to the winds. We will look back and wonder why we didn&#39;t defend the open internet until the very end. Future generations may quite literally live in the matrix. It&#39;s a good thing we exist now, because the truth cannot be destroyed, only hidden. </p>

<p>Pray we stay vigilant in our efforts to uncover these monsters. Someday, it may in fact come down to public assembly. We need to do all we can today to spread concrete stories like this all across the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the opposite, that sin will increase. But God sees all and knows all. And all will be judged. </p>

<p>Isaiah 24:4-5 and 26:21 (ESV) </p>

<p>&quot;The earth mourns and withers, the world languishes and withers. The earth lies defiled under its inhabitants, for they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant. For behold, the Lord is coming out from his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, and the earth will disclose the blood shed on it, and will no more cover its slain.&quot;</p>

<p>If that isn&#39;t a description of the current state of the world, then I don&#39;t know what is. Murderers walk free, child rapists are pardoned and the corrupt receive praise. This world is on a collision course with God and it will not fare well when he unleashes his judgement in wrath. I eagerly await it for those who commit unspeakable evil against the weak and vulnerable, but I fear it for myself because I know my own sins. As <a href="/u/SomeSomeSome8">/u/SomeSomeSome8</a> said: truth can never be destroyed, only hidden, for a time. For the wicked, their time will come, even if only in death. But God will have his revenge: Deuteronomy 32:35-36 (ESV) &quot;Vengeance is mine, and recompense, for the time when their foot shall slip; for the day of their calamity is at hand, and their doom comes swiftly.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When talking about what Abe did, the children used the concrete past tense much more often: &quot;Abraham said, &#39;Yes you did, you little c**t.&quot; When they talk about Papa murdering babies, they talk in general tense: &quot;We hold the knives, we kill the babies, we dance with the skulls. Everyone does it.&quot; But in the final videos where they finally felt comfortable enough to talk about real things, they related specific memories about a friend showing them something on an iPad mini, how Abraham took them on a porch one day in Morocco and told them to say things, etc. Not a jury in the world won&#39;t be able to see through this. Despicable. And maybe the dad does abuse them for all I know; but what seems certain is that Abraham does, if only (mostly) mentally. Heaven forbid it&#39;s anything worse. According to Alisa, she has a habit of keeping her hands over her self for when he kicks her with his boots. &quot;I hate Abraham. I don&#39;t want to see him any more. He&#39;s not even our father. I don&#39;t want to call him Papa Hemp.&quot; I don&#39;t recall Gabriel making these types of emotional rejection statements about his real dad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The children didn&#39;t just say Abraham coerced their accusations against their father. They also said (one, or both, I don&#39;t remember) that Abraham kicked them in their privates, and Alisa said clearly that he kicks her in her bum on a regular basis, to the extent that she maintains a habit of keeping her hands covering herself when she&#39;s around him. Further, both the mother and Abraham had videos of the children engaging in sex acts on their iPhones. Gabriel said Abraham hit him hard in his ear, and Gabriel has in fact been shown to have hearing loss in that ear. Posing the question in a way that removes Abraham as a suspect is disingenuous, as is limiting the question of abuse to only one type. The truly simple questions would be 1: Were the children abused? 2: Who abused them if so?</p>

Gabriel said Abraham told him about plastic willies and that&#39;s where he got the knowledge that there was such a thing as plastic willies (Abraham had first tried to get Gabriel to say real willies were used). Gabriel also expressed fear about being with Abraham, and said he hated him. He said no such things about his biological dad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. How does one protect his ass when dealing with &quot;delicate&quot; issues?</p>

<p>The only thing I could think up was sending a registered letter to a trusted friend, stating you are NOT suicidal, perfectly happy and if anything happens it is related to the fact you were looking into &quot;x&quot; issue.  Tell the friend NOT to open the letter,  this way the date on receipt of delivery and the fact it is sealed is lasting proof you are mentally stable.</p>

<p>If anything happens, the letter would need to be opened by a sworn person (lawyer, notary, cop, judge).</p>

<p>This would discredit any unexpected &quot;suicide&quot; we sometimes see in high-profile issues. </p>

<p>My 2 cents, I was just thinking out loud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be very careful with this story, it could very well be used as a weapon to control the net.  These kids named people, there is an obviously controlling mother involved and the whole thing could be total bullshit.  The fact that the Google drive is still there and open shows that perhaps the powers that be are happy for this story to grow.  Why?</p>

<p>If this story gets bigger then it is only a matter of time until an individual or group decide &#39;to do something about it&#39; and attack one or more of the named people.  They might do severe harm or even kill one or more of the named people.  Only then will the truth of the twisted controlling mother come out, and everyone will be aghast that &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; believed a couple of fucked up children&#39;s quite obviously loony stories.  The gvt will step in to control all websites that are available in the UK, possibly Europe wide laws will be introduced.  </p>

<p>Think sensibly about it.  Firstly, these websites are pulling information on Hampstead from the last two decades.  Hampstead is a densely populated area and just like any other densely populated are, given a 20 year period to examine legal strangeness, activities that have gone on etc you will dig up a lot.  Secondly, just be calm and look at what these kids are saying.  </p>

<p>The children say that every parent of every child at their school is a member of a pedophile gang.  Other members of this pedo network are Police, Clergy, Social Services, shop workers, and lastly every teacher at their school.  Who do these mostly extremely wealthy people choose to be their leader?  That&#39;s right, an unemployed actor who is in receipt of welfare.  This master pedo happens to be the father of these two children, oh and his mother (the children&#39;s grandmother).   Now, ask yourself, what is the likelihood of this being true?  One in a billion?  More?  Is the more likely explanation simply that the mother is the queen of all cunts and she has manipulated her own children to say these things?</p>

<p>Or do you really believe that the parents who can afford to live in Hampstead, where the average house is worth a couple of million dollars for a fucking lease, would follow a welfare scrounger and his mum, and sit back offering their own children up to be fucked in the ass?  </p>

<p>Down vote me all you like, but if you want to believe total lunacy that&#39;s up to you.</p>

<p>You sound like a shill. I&#39;m not saying you <em>are</em> a shill, because that is against the rules, and I wouldn&#39;t want to accuse you of anything without evidence. But out of courtesy I&#39;m obliged to tell you that your post takes on the tone and attitude of someone who is interested in actively discrediting this story, rather than simply discussing it. You may want to change your wording so that you don&#39;t sound so dismissive and condescending. </p>

<p>Generally when children come forward with allegations of physical and sexual abuse, one takes them seriously. But I&#39;ve noticed that threads about this story get the attention of users who are keenly interested in discrediting the mother by using personal attacks and calling her names. Strange, don&#39;t you think? </p>

<p>Edit: How do you know the father is on welfare? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said in the post, it bothers me that the videos name names and are still up there. Yes, we should be careful. However, everything I&#39;ve seen so far points to this story being true. </p>

<p>The kids are not talking about every child in the school being part of this... there are about 20 parents from what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>How do you know the actor is receiving welfare? Do you have a reference for that?</p>

<p>Why would the mother make her children say these things? Legally this would put her in an indefensible position if the tattoos are not where the kids say they are. Also the kids have shown signs of sexual abuse - so someone is abusing them.... if it is the mother, then why should she draw attention to it?</p>

<p>Did you watch the Sabine interview? </p>

<p>Of course, we have to leave room for the possibility that this is a hoax. If you have information that points to this, then I want to know. Thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just find it a huge stretch to believe that the only parent at the school who is not a child fucker happens to be their mum.  They also say the CAF team sexually abused them too.  CAF has nothing to do with the school, it is entirely independent from it. So the school cannot selectively recruit CAF staff.  </p>

<p>I would share your belief if the kids said one social worker, a couple of the parents and one police and social worker.  However, they clearly say all of them, just not their mother.  Also that statement by the mother is clearly the work of a fantasist.  I guarantee this is not true.  The social services have removed the children from the mother already and that speaks volumes.</p>

<p>Edit:  What I mean is that a pedo ring, or any organized criminal activity can be arranged.  However, it needs a central hub.  The BBC or even Westminster are prime examples - they can easily have pedo rings within them because they can select who goes there.  Look at the BBC, they actively employed pedophiles exclusively.  Jimmy Savile got his job at the Beeb not because he was a great DJ, but because he was a pedophile and he fit in with the rest of them.  He was moving in the pedo circle long before he worked at the BBC.  The same thing can happen with politicians too.  You can&#39;t just represent any party you feel like, there is a selection process that you must go through, this too can be influenced by pedophiles, they want a pedophile just like them to come and join them at Westminster.  It&#39;s much like how the &#39;Gay Mafia&#39; used to work many years ago, there were companies that only employed Gay people.  Nobody outside of the organization knew that was going on, but being gay used to be illegal, and they&#39;d meet in secret clubs, if a gay was looking for a job one of the people at the club/bar would tell them to get a job with them.  There were exclusively gay cafe&#39;s, offices, gvt departments etc.  The same thing can happen with any organization.  </p>

<p>However, a modern school is a very different kettle of fish.  Sure, the Headteacher could be a pedo, and they could employ exclusively pedo teachers, but they can&#39;t control what the local authority do, nor who the local authority send as CAF officers, similarly they can&#39;t control the Police, Social Services nor any other external body.  Where it would get even more difficult is in pupil selection.  How on earth could you ensure that the LEA accepted only pedophile&#39;s children to attend your school?  If the area were poorer I could maybe go for it, but this is a very expensive area.  You&#39;re pickings are out of a tiny pool.  Sure, there are people on Welfare in Hampstead, just as there are people on Benefits living in Mayfair and Park Lane - usually because they moved in a few years ago and the Gvt pay the rent for their properties.  However, these are a tiny minority of the residents of Hampstead.  Most people who live in Hampstead will have very high independent incomes.  Even the Prime Minister doesn&#39;t earn enough (officially) to afford to live in Hampstead.  I doubt most Hampstead people have the time to fuck kids on a Wednesday.  These kids said that Wednesday is sex day at the school.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing to remember about the narrative, if you&#39;re going to critique it (and not some incomplete, broken form of it) is that the pedophilia starts at some absurdly high level and flows downwards. It would be very hard to establish this ring, sure, if it were going the other way up, which feels like your point. It would run into hurdles with the CAF. But before it reaches to the school, it&#39;s already been through the police, the CAF. There is a HUB, it&#39;s somewhere above all of those things, and it&#39;s suggested as much in the videos themselves. We don&#39;t know if Hampstead is meant to be a one-off place, where they focus on controlling a large amount of what&#39;s there compared to what&#39;s controlled in other areas, but that&#39;s not entirely relevant.</p>

<p>Your other points are fair enough, though they&#39;re not particularly convincing as they&#39;re more like suggestions into investigations that would be built on. </p>

<p>I know I will get eye rolls from this, but R.E. &quot;You&#39;re pickings are out of a tiny pool.&quot;- It&#39;s a fallacy to blindly assume any kind of local pedo-to-rich ratio in Hampstead is going to be uninfluenced by organisation. Given the nature of the narrative, rich pedophiles flocking to Hampstead is well within the realm of possibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be careful.</p>

<p>I expressed similar sentiments to you and was accused of being a paid &quot;disinfo agent&quot; as well as receiving numerous abusive messages. My favourite being the one that repeatedly said it was &quot;people like me&quot; are the reason things like this happen.</p>

<p>For the record, I completely agree with you. The scariest thing is how so many people have accepted this on face value with no real concrete evidence or any real facts to back it up. For a subreddit that is supposed to question what they are presented and dissect all the information to come to a logical conclusion, this is honestly quite baffling. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh but Savile and Rotherham and the other people in Hampstead are proof&quot; are usually what I get told but this is all circumstantial. The signs of sexual abuse are also used to prove that their claims are factual. Can these be faked? It is likely and has been done before. If the children are as intelligent as they seem then why is it not feasible that they could do this?</p>

<p>And listen to the claims! Ritual beheading of babies that are then cooked in the McDonalds in East Finchley (in a secret kitchen), children helping with this and drinking their blood, a shop near East Finchley tube station that makes shoes out of babies skin and (as you mention) every school in the area being in on this as well as police, social services, the courts and God knows who else. Some of the people here are even accepting this simply because the children are blonde haired and blue eyed!</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be the first time that children and parents of said children have concocted outlandish stories so as to either wrestle away custody of the children from the other parent or, because the children themselves feel the other parent is more lenient for example and accuse people in authority or parents of abusing them for their own gains. </p>

<p>People&#39;s real names, address and phone numbers are being freely given out too in the various links that have been posted about these claims. I would have thought that would be against the Reddit ToU to facilitate doxxing because it will happen eventually and then, if something untoward were to happen to one of these people, all &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; will be tarred with the same brush and the person we have to blame is one of our own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the faith a lot of us have in the children&#39;s words can be frustrating. You&#39;re right to be skeptical. It&#39;s unfortunate that people are attacking you for it. </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s some context supplied for Hampstead. Apparently Hampstead is a theorized &quot;hotbed&quot; because big-name pedophiles operate or live there, or something.  Hence the ridiculous amount of pedo infiltration. And it does follow a kind of twisted logic. If an entire school is going to be invaded, then it makes sense to invade the social services that tend the children, too. </p>

<p>And off the record, I know how this sounds, but don&#39;t be turned off by the community believing the children. It&#39;s kind of beautiful that the faith does exist in the the community. If this IS real, or if one day something like this comes out that&#39;s real, then literally no amount of cover-up or &quot;logic&quot; like what you&#39;ve given example of will swade us, and the secret, impossible giant ring of pedophilia that crosses schools, and many different local stores. and government organisations will be unearthed, simply because we were stubborn and illogical enough to believe in it. It sounds absurd but that&#39;s our role, really. I know not everybody will like that I&#39;ve used &quot;our,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; here and I apologize for that. </p>

<p>In the end, it will come down to the birth marks/tattoos. </p>

<p>d. To avoid high level embarrassment, the following possible arrangements might be worth considering: </p>

<p>1) Instead of starting public law proceedings against the school, the children are returned – with immediate effect – to live with the maternal grandparents in Russia.</p>

<p>3) Instead of joining the Russian government to the proceedings, the children are released to their mother and maternal grandparents with immediate effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a possibility that if the school and social services are in on it that the police are, too. I&#39;m all for critiquing the story, but if you&#39;re going to run with the story&#39;s logic for such purposes, you kind of have to respect the possibilities that it opens up. If the pedo group is real, the first thing it would infiltrate would foremost be the police. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why it&#39;s such a good conspiracy theory. Going by the theory&#39;s logic it wouldn&#39;t really need to be infiltrated. It would be set up with the system already intact. Its supervisors would have been set up  too. They&#39;d make sure only people in their club succeed in the job interviews. Going from the top-down makes it a lot easier for them to do that.</p>

<p>As for second thought holders, the system has murder threats, and enough blackmail material to ruin any doubter&#39;s career + life. It&#39;s doubtful that whistleblowing these rings even has a meaningful effect, so that&#39;d be there to de-motivate everyone too. Why risk your life for a grass-roots campaign that will ultimately get beaten - that, mind you, you&#39;ve probably seen beaten time and time again in your position. </p>

<p>Anyway, the kids are making very clear accusations: there are 4 torture rooms at the school with a secret door and beheadings and blood and skulls. All of these things, if they exist, will be easy to find for the police. This all should become very clear very quickly.</p>

<p>Babies are supplied from all over the world. They buy them, inject and send by TNT, DHL service or the parents bring them from other parts of the world. For example Sophie&#39;s parents bring them from America, Hawaii; Vanessa (Clark and Lindsey&#39;s mother) - from South Africa, Cartney&#39;s parents bring babies from Portugal, Spain; Millie&#39;s parents bring babies from Gayana, China, India, America. Baby sacrifice, blood drinking, dancing with the Baby&#39;s skulls happen in the church on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Main day is Wednesday, ritual performance is at 11 am in the secret church rooms.</p>

<p>Skulls, baby skin shoes are kept in the secret rooms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you been following this story? The children are being abused inside of a Catholic church, in-part by a Catholic priest, who are clearly practicing Satanic rituals.

    <div class="md"><p>I have been following this story, yes. It appears that the cult story was a lie, and that the mother&#39;s boyfriend (ex-boyfriend now it seems) may have been abusing the children and made them tell this story for whatever reason. My point is, you don&#39;t need to be a Satanist to want to rape and kill children. In fact, I don&#39;t believe that there are <em>actual</em> Satanic cults that perform <em>actual</em> Satanic rituals because there has never been an established &quot;religion&quot; dedicated to the Biblical Satan. There are no rituals, it&#39;s just people trying to add some drama and performance to their child raping parties. God and the Devil have nothing to do with this. It&#39;s a human disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The below is a short transcript from the 17th Sept interview between Steve and Gabriel starting at 5:35:  </p>

<p>S: We talked in two other interviews before, didn&#39;t we?<br/>
G: Yes<br/>
S: Was what you told me the truth?<br/>
G: Yes<br/>
S: So all the stuff about the babies...<br/>
G: Yeah<br/>
S: and the church and all that...<br/>
G: No, No... the babies... um... the baby... he um... no, well there is some of the babies killed, yeah.<br/>
S: Ok.... Are you sure?<br/>
G: Yes, but not much. Not every single day, not every single day... like... killed no, not like that.<br/>
S: Ok, because I heard you watched a film....   </p>

<p>Steve then brings up Zorro and leads Gabriel into foster care. Absolutely disgusting! Gabriel is only eight and in this interview has real trouble explaining the new version of events.  </p>

<p>In summary, according to Gabriel, the murdering of babies was still carried out, just &quot;not much&quot;, &quot;not every single day&quot;.  </p>

<p>Unbelievable how people can take this final video as gospel! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>r.e: &quot;The one thing that bothers me about the video is that I can&#39;t work out why it has been allowed up on youtube for so long.&quot;</p>

<p>This is my view on the matter; the government/evil/whatever doesn&#39;t actually need to worry about deleting genuine videos and sources because it has faith that these videos will end up being incoherent vessels of information to the general population. They know the minority group of conspiracy theorists will see and believe the videos, but they&#39;re okay with that, because we&#39;re one of the most disliked and isolated &quot;white&quot; sub-cultures in the Western world. If anything, keeping this video up helps their agenda, because the non-conspiracy theorists that do see it, will see that we&#39;re supporting it and we&#39;re not really questioning the kids, and then they&#39;ll say something like, &quot;Wow, those people really ARE batshit crazy to believe this insane story from 2 kids.&quot; It&#39;s set up so that the content that aids us also harms us. The work done is perpetually isolating. </p>

<p>My god, these people are sick. It&#39;s like the UK child &quot;protection&quot; system is built around child snatching for these Cults that torture/rape/eat children. These demons must be brought to justice. If we allow these PSYCHOS to do this? What are we?! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if they will come back with anything. </p>

<p>It seems that all the usual bastions of &quot;truth&quot; are ignoring or trying to discredit this. David Icke gave out a link to the petition, but did not show the video(s), despite the fact that they support everything he has been saying. Alex Jones&#39; Infowars did a report (by Paul Joseph Watson) saying (twice) that it is &quot;almost certainly a hoax&quot;, and now UK Column appear to be avoiding it. </p>

<p>At least here in r/Conspiracy it is getting some action. The mods have been very supportive and I think we should be grateful. People complain about this sub, and I have done too - but when you put it in context, it is actually pretty great. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if you have any contact with the police who are conducting this investigation, but I believe Alisa may be referring to &quot;Zoroark,&quot; [a Pokemon thing] not &quot;Zorro.&quot; She clearly says &quot;Zoroark&quot; in the 17 Sep interview at 10:33:51; she then refers to it again as &quot;Zoros.&quot; There is in fact a piece of Pokemen fan fiction called &quot;Alyssa the Zoroark&quot; which involves all kinds of sexuality and killing and (I would call it) vulgarity--even though the protagonist is supposed to be 13 years old. At any rate, because Alisa clearly said Zoroark, I think this movie thing may have nothing to do with Zorro, and police should be made aware of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I have no contact with somebody from police. My original source this time was the David Icke forum where it was posted. I was just the quickest to post it over here. I just came back and until now I saw only 30 minutes. The beginning of  two videos and the middle of the last video of Alisa where she retracts everything. I will watch them no to get an impression. At the moment I find it odd that on the 11th the kids seems to be happy and on the later videos they seem to be tired an depressed. Just my first quick impression based on a few frames.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just finished watching Gabriel&#39;s videos...</p>

<p>To summarize, after being in the care of social services Gabriel totally changed his story and implicated the boyfriend as opposed to Papa. This fits in with everything we have already been told by the source so far. </p>

<p>In the 17th Sept interview it&#39;s obvious to me he is struggling with this new side of the story and has trouble with the truth. This is especially evident at around the 5:45 mark when discussing the killing of babies.  </p>

<p>One thing we should be clear on before moving forward is that these children have been abused and the medical report proves this.</p>

<p>Then why are you parading the exploitative videos and adding to the hysteria?  One of the links tells me that the UK courts have been trying to take them down to protect the children&#39;s identities and protect them from the hysteria.  The other reason is that this is an ongoing child abuse investigation and UK law has always prevented the publication of victims and the accused in an ongoing investigation.  So this is all very interesting but it is also a little messed up to see it promoted in a sticky and on the sidebar of a major subreddit.  Some of your links even have phone numbers, addresses of those linked to the abuse.   This seems strange that it is even allowed.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mine is more a knee jerk reaction to seeing this information dump on something very current and on a large forum like this.  I don&#39;t think have these kids faces all over the internet helps them or their school.   Having the names and addresses of suspected abusers released alongside these videos is dangerous for both the guilty and innocent given the hysteria. </p>

<p>I think the  police and social services isn&#39;t one entity and it will be kept in check one way or another.  There is a case of the people making their failures a priority and political issue but the cases need to be sanitised  to  protect the innocent.</p>

<p>You have brought up forced adoption and the trend of social services to be too proactive and reactionary to childs protection.  This is kind of the opposite to some of the issues that might brought up here - i.e. social services and the police not doing enough. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think &quot;we the people&quot; can force the investigations, accountability and public inquiry.    UK just got that judge from new zealand in to head up a public inquiry into paedophilia to heighten trust.   But it is interesting when we do abandon the system altogether.  It makes me think of things like the 911 truth movement.</p>

<p>I mentioned it because we are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.    It is an example of how people have taken an investigation into their own hands after everything else is exhausted.  It was a specific answer to your question and an example of when trust if lost in government entities.  My point is that a citezens investigation is what should happen a very long way down the road and not the first point of inquiry as the internet seems to encourage.   I thought you asked a general question which might be a misunderstanding</p>

<p>Dumping exploitative videos of your own children on the internet is not careful or caring.  If the videos are true, then the children need to be in protection.  If they are false, then the child need to be in protection.  The children need to be taken out of this fucked up situation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was because the children were in protection that this information was released. This is not the &quot;first point of enquiry&quot; but a last resort. I don&#39;t think you understand the history of this case. </p>

<p>Please answer the first question in my last post... Put yourself in the mother&#39;s position. What would you do if your child confessed to being sexually abused at school and implicated the police and SS too. Next thing your child is being taken away from you, but you have these video as proof of the testimonies. What would you do if pedo&#39;s took away your child? </p>

Getting your children back means showing you can offer them safety and is not a matter of proving that there is some widespread abuse.  The mother is most likely some sort of victim here too.   </p>

<p>The main signal I looked at when glancing at this case was to see that the school is still open and no further action there.  I know how seriously paedophilia cases are taken once the ball is rolling especially in a school environment where other children could be at risk.  So I have come to a conclusion on this even though some of the video evidence is fascinating and compelling.  My main reason for posting here is that there is too much personal info being dumped here about real people and some kind of idea that this is helping.</p>

<li><p>After you&#39;ve done this, got no where and now your life has been threatened, you have two options left... release the videos or do nothing. Which one?  </p></li>
<li><p>You admit the evidence is &quot;compelling&quot;, yet complain that we have access to the evidence (in its original format). Which is in the best interests of society, Transparency of Secrecy?   </p>

<p>For the record, I believe ALL information should be available to everyone, no exceptions!

    <div class="md"><p>I guess release the video.  It sure is an act of desperation that might be real or percieved.  There is definitely a story behind this.</p>

<p>I find the kids testimony compelling as in it is really interesting and better than  a lot of fiction .  </p>

<p>However, I have some first hand understanding of the UK system and the safeguards for child protection.  Even with all the commotion about historical sex abuse, something as big as what those kids told us or even just a fraction of it could not be covered up when the police, social services and school have been involved.  Hence, I am a little worked up about privacy than knowing the actual truth behind all this.  Those sidebar photos burn with emotion.</p>

<p>That book looks interesting.    It blows my mind to think how the whole world would work and so would have to read it.    I may be missing the bigger picture but that philosophy of ALL information is available for everyone does sound like a good one for online communities like reddit (thinking about those secretive moderators and all things like alt accounts that we cannot idenity).</p>

<p>The newsinsideout.com has the name and address of the vicar.  It has the address of the kids father.  It has the address of the school.  Even just the  videos have real names and specifies location and workplace details throughout.  </p>

<p>When the investigation is over and this makes the mainstream news, I expect they will severly mask the idenities of the children in the video or just use actors.  This is because protecting the children is paramount.  </p>

<p>However the evidence DOES prove abuse took place in the mother&#39;s care, thus they were removed. Both the father and partner have a history of violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the establishment here in the UK seems to be fairly twisted. I&#39;m particularly disturbed by the apparent foot-dragging in investigations into Rotherham and the parliamentary thing. And whilst it&#39;s been in our newspapers I don&#39;t think these stories have seen nearly as much coverage as I&#39;d have expected. . . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally get that the children in the &quot;we dance with skulls&quot; debacle may have been abused by someone.</p>

<p>But if what the children are saying is true, there are literally hundreds of babies at risk at this very moment of being murdered. The children themselves confessed to participating in the murder of dozens or more children.</p>

<p>This can all be sorted pretty quickly (and MUST be!) by swabbing the mother&#39;s and father&#39;s apartments and vehicles for DNA that shouldn&#39;t be there. The children would have brought home literally hundreds of pieces of DNA evidence on their clothing, shoes, skin, hair, etc.</p>

<p>The current judge seems disinclined to believe the children; the discovery of DNA in the mother&#39;s and/or father&#39;s homes would immediately reverse her stance and launch a vigorous inquiry.</p>

<p>People are going on and on about custody issues for the living children, but we are talking about many, many other children facing death at this very moment if what Alisa and Gabriel are saying is true. Preventing future deaths must be a priority in this case.</p>

<p>Yet when I bring this up, no one (&quot;no one&quot; consisting largely of the mother&#39;s online internet team, I believe) seems interested. &quot;How dare you distract from the issues!!&quot; they scream.</p>

<p>Sorry, but the impending murder of hundreds of children--which is what is imminent according to Alisa and Gabriel--is literally an emergency. Not only that, evidence supporting past murders would be the fastest way to get people to listen to Alisa, Gabriel and their mother regarding their own abuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My bet&#39;s on Abraham or some former, unnamed boyfriend. Or, more sadly yet, the mother herself. Alisa also refers to a girl friend at school who allegedly pressured Alisa to touch her; maybe the real abuse was by this girl?

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s Abraham since Gabriel said he yelled at them, hit them hard with his hand, hit with a spoon, &#39;water torture&#39; etc. and they just didn&#39;t want to talk about it.   It&#39;s possible Abraham made up the story to cover his own sexual abuse of them. Abraham sounds like an abusive person, also a bit of a nutcase. Alisa said she thought he was an idiot. She seems smart, definitely the better liar. Not to say anything bad about her though, she was coerced by Abraham to lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m concerned about disseminating childrens&#39; faces and other identifying material in relation to a sexual abuse case. There are serious matters of privacy, particularly considering that the allegations made here will follow these children for life. I think it&#39;s incumbent upon the community here to protect these children first. </p>

<p>There is also the matter that these are allegations. And while there appears to be some physical evidence of abuse provided by physicians, there is no proof that the claims made by these kids are anything more than confabulation and/or coaching. So, along with protecting the privacy of these children, I think it&#39;s also incumbent upon the community to protect the identities of those alleged to have committed crimes. </p>

<p>Remember the Boston Bombing witch hunt fiasco? Reddit should not be the go-to place for organizing vigilante justice. </p>

<p>With that in mind, I&#39;ve been editing videos as I can. Blurring faces, altering voices, and redacting names and addresses. The fact that this information is in the videos is probably why police have been working with Google et all to remove them from public access. I hope that these redactions will allow dissemination according to the standards of professional newsgathering, thus both meeting the public good and protecting privacy. </p>

<p>So far I&#39;ve got five done. I&#39;d like some community input before I change them from &#39;unlisted&#39; to &#39;public&#39; on Youtube. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A fascinating perspective. By your logic, I lack &quot;courage&quot; and &quot;perspective&quot; for blurring the faces and altering the voices of children giving statements in relation to a sexual abuse case. </p>

<p>&quot;Every little consequence&quot;. You mean those death threats by a mob brought against innocent people during the Boston Bombing witchhunt right here on Reddit? Because that happened. Really. </p>

<p>Furthermore, disseminating the likeness and identities of these children is a violation of child privacy laws here in the United States and in Great Britain. Furthermore, it&#39;s also a violation of Reddit policy to not release personal information nor dox the identities of people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have the testimony of the mother, of the lawyer/activist, a retired policeman, the kids themselves - all in support of investigating this. The authorities themselves took the kids from the mother because there were signs of sexual abuse, but they now refuse to investigate the case because after a few weeks in care, the kids have retracted their statement... however, the kids were accusing the police and social services, and the police and social services were the ones (still are) with primary access to the kids between the time they made these claims and the time they retracted them. </p>

<p>The court cases in the UK involving this kind of thing are held in secret. Many of us (and this is not a controversial belief) believe that the system is broken. Even a government report showed that kids in care were six times likely to be a victim of sexual abuse than kids living with their families. </p>

<p>People here on this sub have a natural reaction of disgust at the whole thing. There is no way to prove anything here without an impartial investigation - which is something that is impossible under the current system and in these current circumstances. </p>

<p>Your post is not very helpful to be honest. Obviously you don&#39;t seem to believe the kids... but what if you are wrong? What if there is a paedophile ring in Hampstead, involving teachers, police, parents, social services workers? (it has happened before - just google &quot;care home scandal&quot; or &quot;jimmy savile care home&quot;) - what is the method for dealing with this? Who will protect us from the protectors? What is the safeguard if the system is broken? </p>

<p>These are tough questions. When our leaders are covering up for paedophiles (which is now pretty obvious, and widely reported in the UK), then how do we protect the kids? </p>

<p>Alisa: Because he [Abraham Christie] went like this [lowers voice, changes to different accent]: &quot;They dance around with baby skulls in the church don&#39;t they?&quot; That&#39;s what Abraham told me, and I said, &quot;No they don&#39;t!&quot; And he said, &quot;Yes they do, stop lying, little brat,&quot; that&#39;s what he told me.

    <div class="md"><p>It appears that both Gabriel and Alisa changed their stories on September 17, saying that Abraham forced them to lie. </p>

<p>However in all of the previous interviews with the police, dated September 5 and 11, both Alisa and Gabriel confirm -- with considerable detail -- the ritual killings, sexual abuse and so on. </p>

<p>So both of these children changed their stories on the same date. </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to note that both Gabriel and Alisa are terrible liars. In the videos from September 17 they exhibit <em>all</em> of the hallmarks of a child who is coached or coerced into lying; e.g.., Gabriel fidgets nervously, he evades the questions, he gazes downward before answering, his body posture is guarded, and so on. These mannerisms were strangely absent in the previous videos where he spoke candidly and fluently about the abuse. You can sense the frustration on behalf of the interviewer, who frequently interjects with guiding questions, to get Gabriel to stay on topic. In the previous interviews you will notice that the interviewer does not need to interject nearly as frequently, as Gabriel speaks about his experiences freely and stays on topic. </p>

<p>Furthermore Gabriel gives some very strange, inconsistent answers. When the interviewer asks him if Papa kills babies, Gabriel answers repeatedly, &quot;Some, but not many.&quot; Minutes later he states that it&#39;s not true, Papa does not kill babies. </p>

<p>People really need to watch these videos and draw their own conclusions. </p>

<p>Edit: I forgot to add that both Alisa and Gabriel say they have &quot;no idea&quot; how they got bruises and scars near their genitalia when asked by the interviewer. Before September 17 they explained that it was due to sexual abuse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just the opposite. When children are discussing things that truly bother them, they are fidgety and uncomfortable. When they&#39;re imagining away, encouraged by an adult to basically have a competition with each other to see who can make up the best story, they&#39;re animated. Also, in the final police videos, they quote people saying things--in other words, the remember specific moments, rather than speaking in generalities. &quot;Yes you did, stupid little c**t,&quot; as opposed to &quot;We hold the knives...&quot;  Someone pointed out elsewhere that an overwhelming number of people telling the truth speak in the past tense (&quot;And then I took the knife and I...&quot;) instead of a general tense (&quot;And then we take the knife and we...&quot;)</p>

<p>Assuming you could manipulate siblings into playing a &quot;game&quot; where they lie about their father sexually abusing them and so on...</p>

<p>That is not what the children are claiming in the last interview. They claim that they were <em>physically and verbally coerced</em> by Abraham into telling <em>deliberate lies</em>. There was no mention of a light-hearted game, according to both of them Abraham <em>threatened</em> them when they did not give the answers he wanted. </p>

<p>In which case it is exceedingly bizarre that the children appeared to be at ease with telling their stories, despite that they were apparently coerced to do so.</p>

<p>You need to examine your own reasoning more carefully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say they were happily animated, and I think it&#39;s obvious they were (at times, when together on camera) competing to be the one to tell the stories Abraham was so clearly demanding of them. All I know is that I believe Gabriel when he said he didn&#39;t want to see Abraham again and that he hated him. It was heartbreaking when he then voiced his worry that his mother would be so angry she would hate him (Gabriel) in return. I&#39;ve seen all I need to see. I am well aware that lawyers will attempt to convince a jury that Steve was &quot;leading&quot; the children; all that jury will have to see is the other set of videos to know who&#39;s doing the true leading. So I guess you&#39;d call releasing the videos a bad move on &quot;Papa Hemp&#39;s&quot; part. I hope the guy is put on trial, like, yesterday, and I have felt that way pretty much from the first moment I saw his or Ella&#39;s hand come out of the side of the frame in one video and shove Gabriel&#39;s face back toward the camera.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That was already established in the previous interviews, where the children stick to their story. In the September 17 video the policeman <em>reminds</em> them that they can tell the truth, as he&#39;s told them throughout the process. So that does not explained why they changed their stories. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen any child make up such a vivid, consistent and realistic fantasy. Of course people will laugh when I say that allegations of ritual satanic abuse are &quot;realistic&quot;; but I&#39;m referring to how to is described. For example, the children detail in explicit, practical detail how to kill a baby and drain it&#39;s blood. In the same manner they describe horrendous sexual abuse. </p>

<p>Yet in the September 17 videos they appear evasive, nervous, fidgeting. Gabriel appears especially shy and nervous, even though in the previous interviews he&#39;s established a comfortable rapport with the policeman. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite clear to me that these children were in touch with their father or an authority figure who coerced them into retracting their story  -- but that&#39;s just me. As I&#39;ve said many times, it&#39;s very difficult to get children to lie effectively; you can always tell when a child is telling the truth and when he is not. </p>

<p>Poor kids, really. My heart goes out to them. Whatever the truth is this is an awful situation. </p>

If he had, his room, clothing, hair, shoes, Abraham&#39;s car, Abraham&#39;s friend&#39;s black cab, and all the rest would be absolutely covered (by forensic standards) with the DNA of dozens of murder victims.

This will swiftly substantiate the children&#39;s claim to have participated in murders, and the judge will not hesitate to then issue a warrant to examine the other homes.</p>

Never noticed it before, but in the image for this very topic, you can see the wound on Alisa&#39;s chin which she says Abraham gave her in Morocco. She says he did it with a metal spoon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so I just watched those police videos.  The girl says in the later video that Abraham, the stepfather, told them to say those things and even told her to lie for the first police interview and she was too scared not to lie.  The children were coached by the stepfather and mum to lie, it&#39;s only after a few days away from the parents she felt comfortable in telling the truth.  Having studied psychology, you can tell in the latter videos, the girl is more relaxed and not afraid to speak the truth that the stories were all made up.  Look at the facts people.  There is no Satanic cult going on here.  Just mental abuse by parents to get custody of the children and move them back to Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take your own advice dude. Recent articles point to the mother&#39;s boyfriend having a history of abusing his own children. Not to mention, as soon as these kids were taken out of their home, and away from Abraham, they changed their story.
