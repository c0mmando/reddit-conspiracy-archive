Why would IS kill dozens of hostages when it knows that there will be retaliation? It is clear to me that IS&#39; motives are not to have their prisoners released from foreign governments or to stop airstrikes. If anything IS seems to want more airstrikes and even ground force attacks. There MAY not be some huge conspiracy here but there is definitely more to the story than we are getting. I was wondering what your thoughts are to IS&#39; endgame and goals in their game. </p>

We&#39;ve been fed many names of &quot;different&quot; &quot;Islamic extremists&quot; Al-Qaeda,  Taliban, (what ever happened to those two? did they just disband when Bin Laden died? &quot;Well, It&#39;s been a good fight guys but the boss is dead. Time to call it quits.&quot;) and now ISIS. I wonder what next year&#39;s will be. Also, I don&#39;t think even the most idiotic, violent group of people would try to stop the &quot;War on Terror&quot; with even more terror. If anything these kinds of groups should just be trying to lay low but, they seem to want to stay in the spotlight which seems very odd to me.</p>

<p>No, they didn&#39;t. The Taliban are still in full swing in Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan. And Bin Laden&#39;s right hand man, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, is the current leader of Al Qaeda. It&#39;s just that the media narrative has moved on to ISIS now. But they still make the headlines every now and then, you just have to monitor different news organisations, preferably not Western ones. </p>

<p>One recent example though would be the Pakistani military school massacre carried out by the Taliban in Pakistan, if you recall?</p>

<p>According to MSM, Jordan killed thousands of IS fighters after the video. Now Egypt. </p>

<p>It makes no sense that IS wants to get all their fighters killed. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to know how these countries even know they&#39;re killing IS fighters with their airstrikes. If their positions are so easy to find, why hasn&#39;t the US Wiped them out already? </p>

<p>More like random civilians are being bombed as they walk down the street. </p>

What I find futile is the mindset that nothing is as it seems, that believing the &quot;official story&quot; is automatically stupid simply <em>because</em> it&#39;s the official story and asserting something different because the absence of evidence is used as proof of a coverup.

<p>The US government has provided no evidence that Osama Bin Laden was involved in 9/11.</p>

<p>No evidence he was involved.</p>

<p>Do you understand?</p>

<p>You think I am stupid for questioning a story on which no evidence has been provided.</p>

<p>Imagine you&#39;re on a jury. Someone has been stabbed. A suspect is brought in who happens to own a lot of valuable stuff that the police would love to seize. There is no evidence he did it, but the police say he did. You notice both this guys arms have been amputated. The house the guy broke into to do the stabbing had the worlds best security system, that mysteriously did not work that night. Only the police had the ability to disable the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you are saying is that the US government needed an enemy because it wanted a pretext to invade Afghanistan/Iraq and so they allowed or orchestrated 9/11?</p>

<p>Do you think the US government planned and executed the Twin Towers bombings or do you think they knew it was coming and just let it happen?</p>

<p>Also, why would they use Bin Laden as the scapegoat? It doesn&#39;t seem like a great idea to me to pick a Saudi national to go after because Saudi Arabia is one of America&#39;s closest allies in the region. If they were just creating these enemies out of whole cloth why not an Iraqi or Afghan national?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear lord.</p>

<p>I dont need to provide an alternative theory. It doesnt matter what I believe.</p>

<p>THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS INVOLVED.</p>

<p>The jury here, would throw the case out, and demand that the police provide sufficient evidence of what happened. Its not the jurys job to provide the evidence.</p>
