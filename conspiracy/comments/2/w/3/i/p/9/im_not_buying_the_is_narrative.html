       I guess the question I find myself asking is Why? Why would IS kill dozens of hostages when it knows that there will be retaliation? It is clear to me that IS' motives are not to have their prisoners released from foreign governments or to stop airstrikes. If anything IS seems to want more airstrikes and even ground force attacks. There MAY not be some huge conspiracy here but there is definitely more to the story than we are getting. I was wondering what your thoughts are to IS' endgame and goals in their game.

       Seems kind of hard to believe that they could start up a franchise operation in Libya. Then what's the first thing they do? They do the one thing guaranteed to generate maximum outrage in another country and get that country involved in a war against them.

       We saw Yazidis in Iraq. Decapitated hostages from all kinds of countries. Last week it was that Jordanian pilot and this week it's Egyptian Copts. They've pretty much got every country covered now. But there's always next week.

       Honestly, I don't think they really exist. We've been fed many names of "different" "Islamic extremists" Al-Qaeda,  Taliban, (what ever happened to those two? did they just disband when Bin Laden died? "Well, It's been a good fight guys but the boss is dead. Time to call it quits.") and now ISIS. I wonder what next year's will be. Also, I don't think even the most idiotic, violent group of people would try to stop the "War on Terror" with even more terror. If anything these kinds of groups should just be trying to lay low but, they seem to want to stay in the spotlight which seems very odd to me.

       No, they didn't. The Taliban are still in full swing in Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan. And Bin Laden's right hand man, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, is the current leader of Al Qaeda. It's just that the media narrative has moved on to ISIS now. But they still make the headlines every now and then, you just have to monitor different news organisations, preferably not Western ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       One recent example though would be the Pakistani military school massacre carried out by the Taliban in Pakistan, if you recall?

       Yep, makes no sense whatsoever.

       According to MSM, Jordan killed thousands of IS fighters after the video. Now Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes no sense that IS wants to get all their fighters killed.

       I'd love to know how these countries even know they're killing IS fighters with their airstrikes. If their positions are so easy to find, why hasn't the US Wiped them out already?

       They want to encourage retaliation because they are engaged in political judo. It's the same as what Osama Bin Laden did, piss off a powerful enemy and draw them into your country. The powerful enemy bombs the hell out of everything which kills civilians thus swelling ISIS ranks with the angry relatives of those killed.

       Poking the beast is ridiculous? He killed thousands of Communist Russian troops, he ordered planes to be flown into the twin towers. Say what you like about Bin Laden but he proved himself to be perfectly onboard with attacking an opponent of any size and strength.

       Whats that got to do with whether Bin Laden was involved?

      <p>
       I dont know who did it. By definition, a government coverup means the evidence has been covered up, meaning we dont have access to that information.

       Are you saying that because we dont have solid evidence of who was actually to blame, that it means it must have been Bin Laden?

       Well there is a lot of evidence that the Saudi's were heavily involved. And the prominent Saudi leader of an international terrorist organization who hates the West does seem to be a good candidate for the 9/11 bombings.

       Haha. Look man I just try to go off the evidence I find. If you can show me anything that would change my mind, great. What I find futile is the mindset that nothing is as it seems, that believing the "official story" is automatically stupid simply
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       it's the official story and asserting something different because the absence of evidence is used as proof of a coverup. That seems like a dead end to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say everything shouldn't be questioned and examined, but not everything is a conspiracy.

       Wow.

      <p>
       The US government has provided no evidence that Osama Bin Laden was involved in 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       No evidence he was involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand?

       You think I am stupid for questioning a story on which no evidence has been provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine you're on a jury. Someone has been stabbed. A suspect is brought in who happens to own a lot of valuable stuff that the police would love to seize. There is no evidence he did it, but the police say he did. You notice both this guys arms have been amputated. The house the guy broke into to do the stabbing had the worlds best security system, that mysteriously did not work that night. Only the police had the ability to disable the system.
      </p>

       On what you're saying, you would imprison this man.

       So what you are saying is that the US government needed an enemy because it wanted a pretext to invade Afghanistan/Iraq and so they allowed or orchestrated 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the US government planned and executed the Twin Towers bombings or do you think they knew it was coming and just let it happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why would they use Bin Laden as the scapegoat? It doesn't seem like a great idea to me to pick a Saudi national to go after because Saudi Arabia is one of America's closest allies in the region. If they were just creating these enemies out of whole cloth why not an Iraqi or Afghan national?
