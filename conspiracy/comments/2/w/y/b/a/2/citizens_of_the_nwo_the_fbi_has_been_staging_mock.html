        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;After a recent terror threat on an American mall, an official has revealed that the United States&#39; Federal Bureau of Investigation has been staging mock attacks in U.S. shopping centers for nearly two years to test their readiness.</p>

<p>The secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson recently warned shoppers at Minnesota&#39;s Mall of America to remain vigilant after a new terrorist video from Al-Shabaab -- An Al-Qaeda-linked militant group out of Somalia -- threatened an attack on the iconic mall.
But, an official told CNN that the FBI has been preparing for such an attack for nearly two years, since the militant group led a siege at a Kenyan mall, resulting in more than 60 deaths, CNN reports.</p>

<p>A law enforcement official said that the FBI has teamed up with various malls across the country staging the fake attacks during off hours to test the readiness of SWAT teams.</p>

<p>The Department says there is no specific, credible plot from Al-Shabaab, but since the recent release of a video, reportedly by the group, threatening an attack, the Mall of America has heightened its security, USA Today reports.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you can test the readiness of the SWAT team all you want but to test the readiness of the population to accept the event as real is the real test.  How else are you going to know what impact events will have?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what would you have these agencies do? Apparently preparing for possible scenarios is bad?</p>

<p>Would you rather they didn&#39;t conduct preparedness drills for something like this? Why is the assumption that this is all leading up to false flag preparations and not just trying to prepare the staff and individuals in populated, possible target areas? </p>

<p>Whether you believe certain events were false flags or not, I truly don&#39;t understand why people here are jumping at the oppurtunity to condemn them for conducting preparedness drills. Or is every shooting and bombing a false flag? Furthermore, if this was some form of false-flag prep, why the hell are they telling us about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI&#39;s role is to investigate. It&#39;s in their name. Barring that, their role is to coordinate with the NSA and CIA to prevent. Period. Should an actual attack happen, they have no role to play until requested to join or it&#39;s established that the feds have jurisdiction. After all, you wouldn&#39;t know until after its happened. Which means their FARPing for these attacks is just that, role playing.</p>

<p>The story is really about the FBI playing cowboys and Indians (FARPing), just like local law enforcement. It&#39;s inappropriate and wasteful of resources. If they have the time, money, and personal to do this, their funding needs to immediately be reduced as It&#39;s validating their budget is far too large or they are misappropriating the budget.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. No correlating between these drills and would be false flag operations. That said, they shouldn&#39;t have these drills in the first place. It&#39;s inappropriate and wasteful. If they want to play soldier, they need to put on a uniform and leave this country.</p>

<p>Turns out that one of the co-founders of the Westfield Shopping Group, Frank Lowy, is an associate of <a href="http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Good+luck+larry_5a29d0_4094054.jpg">Larry Silverstein</a>. <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=westfield_america_1">The Westfield Group and Silverstein Properties leased the WTC in July 2001</a> and made billions in insurance claims after 9/11.</p>

<p>The Westfield Shopping Centre in Nairobi was attacked in September 2013, and now this <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11428309/Al-Shabaab-calls-for-attacks-on-Oxford-Street-and-Westfield-centres-in-new-terror-threat.html">al-Shabaab group has threatened the Westfield Shopping Centre in London</a>. Why do these terrorist groups keep targeting poor Silverstein and Lowy!?</p>
