       The torch tower was engulfed, granted not all of it, but didn't come close to falling. Yet WTC 7, shorter and fatter and with no visible flames, fell from "fire". Hopefully this enlightens a few people

       Some high school physics and some chemistry, with an engineering 101 could tell you that.

       Its either a huge design oversight to build a building that has so many critical members that is one fails due to heat expansion entire building collapses, or its a propaganda coverup. Either way Iraq war is unjustified, amrican continued conflicts all around the world are unjustified. A nation byilt on war needs it to servive. Whats a greater catalyst than a national tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this day and age of information manipulation and censorship noone can know enough to make a judgment call on whats actually happening around them, let alone it be the actual truth. I think because religion has been so heavily apart of america the whole belief through faith is heavily embedded into the culture. With the many wars and patriotic thinking, its easy for the common man armed with the information he is given to trust the goverment and believe its motives a d actions are just, are for the people. Information age people, the weapon for the masses. 
To top it all off, heated relations with russia is a huge modern day battle. US cant and wont go toe to toe against another huge military force. So it picks off the developing middle east to fuel its war built nation. With russia it has and is playing a political, economical manipulation game.
      </p>

       But thats just what I think.

       Every time, this happens or new demolitions videos, shills are coining overtime pay. I think government are calculating the cost to maintaining official story; one day, it just costs too much,  it will start mass killing spread, vaccination is good starting point.

       To any one who believes the official "theory" on the events of that day, please read the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       And keep in mind the events of 9/11 started the hell in other countries that have taken the lives of approx. 1 million of their people and effected the lives of those many times that over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truely envy your position on the issue. I wish I could share your sentiment, however my intellect prevents me from forming my beliefs on political opinion over science.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true bull shit is the theory that the 9/11 commission report put out. Or what the mainstream media would like you to believe.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXlC2TlNgEUYouTube">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXlC2TlNgEUYouTube
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is like the believer of the "official theory" in one respect, no one wanted to believe that the official theory is a farce, and had distain for people saying otherwise, but the similarites end there. Intelligence and respect for science prevented them keeping that belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who feels the need to insult people for haveing the courage to accept a very ugly truth, in no way changes the facts or their opinions, and does nothing but make you appear ignorant, and trollish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure many do appreciate the entertainment value when encountering some one like you, (I know I do) and you should have your own page here, but
       <a href="/r/comedy">

       you can create it. I will be the first to sign up. Like many of the ones who take this subject serious, we always need break.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your ignorence gives you the appearence of haveing the mental capacity of a court jester, so why not exploit your talents? Can you juggle too? If not, you might want to pick up that skill, for future vocational opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on your views, that might be a wishful thinking on my part and assumptive that you can actually learn anything. Or take any moral responsibility for the actions of our goverment in the wake of 9/11. Sorry to set the bar that high for you. No one expects you to learn. Or believe anything you dont want to. Despite the science staring you in the eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next time we will just offer you a treat if you can sit or stay. We'll start there.

       It's actually a very effective tactic.  It scrambles reasonable argument with negative ideas -- I don't know if it counts as a form of hypnosis, but whoever came up with it is fucking brilliant.

       A variant of that tactic is to lure someone into an argument, and pace the argument such that they get a personal jab in just before the "continue this thread" arrow.  I assume they've studied the matter and have concluded that most people won't follow the arrow -- and that personal attacks are effective in shaping a thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet another variant is to use massive walls of text to confuse readers.  In this variant, they hop around from subject to subject in the walls of text -- thus scrambling the thoughts of even the most persistent and interested reader.

       Evil is exactely what were up against.  Its the evil of the all mighty dollar.  They will trigger wars, fund both sides, sell guns to both sides, then laugh as the peoples slaughter each other, for their profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesnt matter who wins to them, for the fact the war happened makes them the winner.  They fund both sides so they come out on top either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most sane people cant comprehend how someone can go to those extreme means for a profit, most people are good by nature.  Until we get as sick and twisted as those who do, ie start taking out the people behind the shit instead of picking out sides in a war, the wars will continue, mankind will suffer, and our deaths will be for the amusement and profit of the powers that be.

       We were all put here for a reason, I havent figured out what that is yet. I know to make as much money as possible, stepping on the necks of others, bathing in the blood of people, is not why were here.  We will all die, thats part of life.  I know that is but another beginning for us, and what we do here determines where that beginning is.

       I thought your response was to another post I commented on.  Seeing the context, if you think that was directed at you, it wasnt.  I was directing that at the people who believe  the "official theory" or those that actually believe the 9/11 commission report.  Obviously they dont have the courage to believe the ugly truth the events of 9/11 present.  I do support what you say.  The poor attempt of insulting someone, was directed at the ones who dont, and believe the second greatest set of lies forced on the american people.  The bull shit with JFK would be the first.  Sorry if you took it like that, im on your side.

       How about Wikipedia? Please show me ANY pic of damage to that building that could cause a symmetrical collapse at free fall speed?
      </p>

       Please explain how isolated superficial damage could cause this. I'd love to hear how you think that's possible because it isn't.

       Also what am I basing my claim on? Actually it is based on simple math that is taught in Grade 10. I am not even going to tell you that you couldn't comprehend it. The point is - there is a reason you won't entertain the notion. That part is clear.

       So lets say WTC 7 was indeed damaged from the towers collapsing, and the fire that broke out was a result of the damage. Why did it fall like a controlled demolition at free fall speed from a fire? Ok let's say a massive piece of debris hit a corner of WTC 7, or the side, causing it to buckle under the weight. Why would it fall evenly, and parallel to the ground? Every support beam was severed with even distribution throughout the building. That fall is not natural, especially not so for a fire. There's your explanation as to how it doesn't add up
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I figured I'd return with some proof. Windsor Building in Madrid, Spain in February 2005. It had much more intense fire and lasted for
       <em>
        20 hours
       </em>
       . Part of the building actually
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       collapse, in line with the laws of physics. The whole bloody thing didn't just sink into itself at free fall speed and evenly.

       Let me clarify my statement. Building 7 was very superficially damaged by the collapse. Veeeery superficially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I ask you....  Back up your dubious claim that asymmetrical damage is capable of producing a symmetrical collapse. Really?

       You're what's wrong with the movement.  You're thick as fuck bro.  I'm just saying that the buildings OP mentioned are two completely different structures and you're going off on the same shit people have been talking about for almost 15 years.  I'm not even disagreeing with you.  Find a new hobby this is a bad look for you

       He is "going off" on the same thing people have been talking about for 15 years because it's a question that SHOULD be answered easily.

       Thick as fuck? Why? Because he asked a question that YOU don't have the answer for?

       Because I watched it happen and did my own research in college.  Maybe a couple years after that, it was a long time ago.  I cringe thinking about passing out early copies of loose change on campus and shit.  Suck a dick son, you don't have anything worthwhile to add.

       Fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while I'm doing that -- how 'bout an answer to a simple two-part  question:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         1. Before 9/11/01, had any steel-frame building ever collapsed due to fire?
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         2. Has any steel-frame building collapsed due to fire since then?
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a trick question.  Should be pretty easy to answer.  And it is relevant to OP's question.

       You are comparing a Building WTC made in 1983 to a building Made 25 years later and very definitely taking into account better construction methods and materials of which some came about as a result of 9/11.

       There have been steel frame buildings in the united states since 1890.

       But
       <em>
        miraculously
       </em>
       , the only day that any completely collapsed was Sept. 11, 2001.  You'd think that in 111
       <em>
        (one hundred eleven)

       years there would be a precedent.

       Yeah that's a good point, but still I find it interesting and think my point stands. No matter the materials, the torch tower was engulfed (in segments) and seemed to gut the interior of those rooms. To suggest WTC 7 fell from fire that was not really seen from the exterior means that it had to be burning far hotter than the torch tower, all internally without even seeing it from outside. Basically lava would need to be poured into the main beams to support this view. I'm no architect and not pretending to be an expert here, but if anything this just confirms my view of that fall or demolition

       I'm on voat.co now, and have been having a fantastic time -- it's much more relaxing and rewarding than reddit.

       One thing that really special is that I do not have to go to conspiracy to have a very honest and open talk.  You should try it out.  I have the same username as this, so you'll know I am right.

       And yes, to answer your question directly, I DID think that Bldg 7 was a controlled demolition, and have thought so for a long time, along with a couple of other points which a CHILD could notice -- it's not like it's that hard.  Just google Bldg 7 yourself and see how straight it falls, and essentially free-fall all the way down.
