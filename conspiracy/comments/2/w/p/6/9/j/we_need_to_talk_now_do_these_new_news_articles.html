        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Europe is making pacts in fear of Russia. Everyone is making pacts to militarily defend each other, just like in the lead-up to the First World War. Two news articles I just became aware of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Finland and Sweden make a pact because Russia now has the demonstrated naval power to cut off their access to Europe by blocking the North Sea. Neither are in NATO, but they do have what are called &quot;NATO host agreements&quot; which means that NATO troops can enter their countries. <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/scared-russia-sweden-finland-make-war-pact-1821906">http://www.ibtimes.com/scared-russia-sweden-finland-make-war-pact-1821906</a></p></li>
<li><p>Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine (!!) make a mutual military defense/test exercise treaty. It is backed by NATO/US, which grants NATO/US armies access to these countries. In a recent development Romania, Bulgaria,  Estonia have now joined. They&#39;re all in NATO except Ukraine. <a href="http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/02/20/army-expands-atlantic-resolve/23693557/">http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/02/20/army-expands-atlantic-resolve/23693557/</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>I made a map of all these developments. It&#39;s very crude, I made it in paint, but it should get the idea across of what we&#39;re dealing with here if this conflict were to proceed further. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qVC6P7F.png">http://i.imgur.com/qVC6P7F.png</a></p>

<p>I would welcome more discussion on this topic. It&#39;s important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atlantic Resolve is not a mutual defense pact, but it&#39;s threatening to become one. I assert that we have been fighting world war 3 for a long time. The operational phase, so to speak, began in 2001 when the US secured vital military bases in Afghanistan and Iraq. This operation -- falsely identified as the &#39;War on Terror&#39; -- has been waged since then to take out critical Chinese and Russian allies: Libya, Syria and eventually Iran and Lebanon. These places are important geopolitically: e.g., Assad was a strategic cockblocker of a gas pipeline that was to run from Qatar to Europe, Gaddafi wanted to establish a north African union that traded oil with its own non-US currency, and so on. </p>

<p>In fact the idea to destroy Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria was laid out in explicit detail in a report called &#39;Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses&#39; published in 2000 by an organization called the Project for a New American Century. The report said that they would need a &#39;pearl harbor-like&#39; event to justify so many wars against so many countries, but Dick Cheney, Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld (who were signatories of this document) apparently got what they needed on September 11, 2001. It is worth reading in its entirety for gems such as this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Advanced forms of biological warfare that can “target” specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century</a></p>

<p>General Wesley Clark alluded to these plans in an interview with DemocracyNow. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw</a></p>

<p>What&#39;s going on in Ukraine and eastern Europe is an escalation and expansion of this operation, to be sure. But it started long before in the late 90s when countries like Poland joined NATO and effectively encircled the bear. You never corner the bear. George F. Kennan (the so-called father of containment policy) understood this basic principle of realpolitik:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;I think it is the beginning of a new cold war,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Kennan from his Princeton home. &#39;&#39;I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else. <strong>This expansion would make the Founding Fathers of this country turn over in their graves.</strong> We have signed up to protect a whole series of countries, even though we have neither the resources nor the intention to do so in any serious way. [NATO expansion] was simply a light-hearted action by a Senate that has no real interest in foreign affairs.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;What bothers me is how superficial and ill informed the whole Senate debate was,&#39;&#39; added Mr. Kennan, who was present at the creation of NATO and whose anonymous 1947 article in the journal Foreign Affairs, signed &#39;&#39;X,&#39;&#39; defined America&#39;s cold-war containment policy for 40 years. &#39;&#39;I was particularly bothered by the references to Russia as a country dying to attack Western Europe. Don&#39;t people understand? Our differences in the cold war were with the Soviet Communist regime. And now we are turning our backs on the very people who mounted the greatest bloodless revolution in history to remove that Soviet regime.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;And Russia&#39;s democracy is as far advanced, if not farther, as any of these countries we&#39;ve just signed up to defend from Russia,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Kennan, who joined the State Department in 1926 and was U.S. Ambassador to Moscow in 1952. &#39;&#39;It shows so little understanding of Russian history and Soviet history. <strong>Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then [the NATO expanders] will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are -- but this is just wrong.&#39;&#39;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/02/opinion/foreign-affairs-now-a-word-from-x.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/02/opinion/foreign-affairs-now-a-word-from-x.html</a></p>

<p>But you could say that we&#39;re currently in the brinkmanship phase of world war 3. The Russians and Chinese have gathered their friends and decided that they have waited long enough, it&#39;s time to push back. Realistically this could go one for another 5-10 years, but probably no longer than 2020 after major pipeline infrastructure between Russia and China comes online. By that point there will be some kind of confrontation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting points. I learned that all members of the Operation Atlantic Resolve are NATO members, with the glaring exception of Ukraine. So effectively it&#39;s just an extension of an existing military defense treaty, aka NATO, while conveniently bringing Ukraine in to the fold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes -- The Russians took Crimea without hesitation because they needed to protect the black sea fleet. I suppose the Obama administration expected them to just strip down their flagship fleet and sell the scraps back to their new NATO neighbor. </p>

<p>But the rest of Ukraine is flatland, perfect for rolling through with combined arms -- tanks, troops, artillery. The Russians know this because that&#39;s how the Germans blitzkrieg&#39;d them in Operation Barbarossa, by going through Poland and Ukraine.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve been very impressed with Putin&#39;s patience and temperance. The degree of NATO provocation is extreme. I expected him to roll into Kiev months ago, but he&#39;s being smart by seeking a resolution through the UN security council without taking his eyes off of the real battlefield... Syria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never thought of WWIII happening as we speak and this being an operational phase. What I wonder though, and maybe it&#39;s grasping for optimism, is whether or not nuclear power countries would be involved in direct military operations in what might be and will be viewed as WWIII so to speak in the future. </p>

<p>Nuclear weapons changes the landscape or things, and while it is scary to think of them being set off, I like to believe all world leaders are material hedonist, who understand that setting off nukes could potentially end the world. </p>

<p>In this scenario, I could almost see Russia China US, etc. directly supporting countries without nukes in direct confrontation with one another without directly declaring war themselves. We are already seeing inklings of such examples, with Russia support for rebels in Ukraine and NATO supporting the government. Syria, Libya, etc. These world powers may even send their own soldiers, commandos, and intelligence officers to directly fight, (and again we have seen this happen too) but all done in a systematic and uninvolved manner in which no war is declared. </p>

<p>Potentially, Russia, China, and the US would only attack one another if they were invaded by another nuclear powered country. This is what makes the Pakstan/India conflict all the more frightening as they border one another, have massive militaries, and nukes. The world is lucky for the most part that the big superpowers exist within their own spheres away from each other&#39;s borders. </p>

<p>Edit: Pretty much the DIFFERENCE between now and WWI is that there are nuclear weapons. That changes everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, in &#39;07, there was a panic in which the nation&#39;s biggest banks collapsed, threatening regional banks with insolvency, and the nation&#39;s biggest financier had to guarantee the deal.  This is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907">Panic of 1907</a>, and it has these similarities in common with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308">Financial Crisis of 2007-08</a>, as well as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession">Great Recession</a>.  What I&#39;m getting at here is that history tends to repeat itself, and in this case it&#39;s not because of some mystical coincidence, but it&#39;s inherent in the design of the system.  </p>

<p>I believe that it is due to remarkably regular Boom-and-Bust cycles of the economy.  The American economy in particular, due to a gaping lack of regulation, lacks structural integrity.  American markets, due to systemic over-leveraging, over-respond to shifts in the global economy, throwing off balance of the whole system.  It&#39;s as though your body is the global economy, and America is the head, but America weighs 100 lbs (or 50 kilos, whatever, it&#39;s a metaphor.)<br/>
After 1907, Americans tried to regulate the banks, but there was a ludicrous amount of <em>regulatory capture</em> (essentially a conflict of interest in which big banks and regulators are hand-in-hand fucking the people).  Because of the inability of American finance to regulate itself, and the lack of willingness of the regulators to actually step in, the Great Depression soon came.  </p>

<p><a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/09/13/uk-pope-war-idUKKBN0H808R20140913">The pope has said the current conflicts actually amount to a &quot;piecemeal World War.&quot;</a>  So, if you subscribe to his thinking, we&#39;re already in WWIII, just the early stages.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re looking at for the next 10-15 years, just based on history: we&#39;ll see the final filigree of this New Gilded Age, and inequality will get much worse worldwide.  Shit will hit the fan, full-out fascist regimes will come in, and we&#39;ll go to full-scale world war.</p>

<p>So, that said, let&#39;s look at some important differences.  Turkey is not the Ottoman Empire, far from it.  The presence of ISIS, however, will be a catalyst to change the Middle East.  Someone, some nation, will eventually be forced to take on ISIS directly.  If they win, they will control the former ISIS territory.  The US has proven that a non-Islamic state cannot control people in that part of the world, so it will need to be an Islamic country, or a set of Islamic countries, who take control.  The likely candidates are Turkey, who is basically the modern capital of the Islamic world; and Iran, which consists of the modern semi-fascist theocratic remnants of the Persian empire.  The US (by which I mean TPTB, the intelligence agencies and the moneyed class, as well as our close ally Israel) doesn&#39;t want anyone in that region to gain too much sway, and Uncle Sam <em>certainly</em> doesn&#39;t want a coalition of Arab states coming together to fight a common enemy (because then they would just turn around and attack Israel on the way home, or so Israeli politicians think.)</p>

<p>If you think that people can&#39;t starve in the streets in 2015, remember that there are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/14/us/nasa-study-western-megadrought/">megadroughts</a> on their way.  Food costs will skyrocket, and we could face shortages that will shock people.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a huge difference in <strong>scale</strong>.  The world economy is so much larger, so much more integrated, so much more powerful, that a Great Depression today would wreak much more havoc than it did a hundred years ago.  China, India, South America, these are just some of the major players that hardly factored in previous world wars.  Well, now they&#39;ve arrived, and they&#39;re gonna play hard.</p>

<p>These are just my thoughts, I know it&#39;s a wall of text, but I love to kick the ball around talking about this shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only say so due to what Tom Bowman said on NPR to so many people yesterday morning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MASROUR BARZANI: We have liberated thousands of square kilometers. Now it&#39;s time for the Iraqi army to advance from the south toward Mosul. And that is the key. Mosul has to be completely isolated for any effective assault and, let&#39;s say, guaranteed operation.</p>

<p>SHAPIRO: And he told me, I wish I could tell you the Iraqi army is ready for that, but it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>INSKEEP: Really, Tom Bowman? They&#39;re not ready after years of training by U.S. troops?</p>

<p>BOWMAN: Well, the U.S. has pretty much cherry picked the Iraqi forces that will take part in this operation. And the officer we spoke with yesterday said, listen, they&#39;re getting better all the time. But of course, you know, that&#39;s questionable. This is an army that basically fell apart last year once the Islamic State started attacking. But with this Mosul operation, one of the things is even if they&#39;re not the best, they will have the benefit of having U.S. airstrikes and U.S. surveillance. But are they ready? That&#39;s still a question.</p>

<p>INSKEEP: Would U.S. troops have to be involved on the ground?</p>

<p><strong>BOWMAN: That hasn&#39;t been resolved yet. There is talk of having some U.S. troops on the ground, such as air controllers to call in airstrikes, some Green Berets to steal their spine - but again, no decisions yet. But people I talk with say expect some U.S. troops on the ground</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, the assessment you are making does have real world historical parallels to the build up to WWI. </p>

<p>Your geopolitical assessments are also accurate, but I have witnessed this militiary posturing from Russia and Europe every five years or so and many of the present conditions are similar to these situations since the Cold War has ended. </p>

<p>What is concerning to me though are the military buildup and pacts that are being conducted in the Russian Caucas and Middle East. I could go more into it at a later time. Take a look less at Europe and more at Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Syria and Libya. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that is an interesting geopolitical theory. The cartels do run rampant through Mexico, and it already has been theorized and confirmed that facets of the American government are highly involved in the cartels and are supporting them for whatever may be their own intentions. </p>

<p>Just as Iran, Hezbollah and the Syrian government are funding Civil Defense groups throughout Syria to offset the terrorist threats, I can see this feasibly happening in Mexico. </p>

<p>Brazil, India, and South Africa are growing world powers that can really set off the balance of American hegemony. </p>

<p>Everyone can see and report bullshit, I find it very unlikely that a world war of the same scale is ever going to happen. A LOT of people now have friends all over the globe and would refuse to fight each other.</p>

<p>It will be specialized units against other specialized units. It will be soldiers with no access to the internet, highly brainwashed... it won&#39;t be entire populations mobilizing (except for North Korea)</p>
