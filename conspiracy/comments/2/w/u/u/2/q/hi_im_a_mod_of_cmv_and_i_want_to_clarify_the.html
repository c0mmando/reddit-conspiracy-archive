      <p>
       I hope this comment gains some visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not dismissing any of you, but I am wary of posting here because I am unsure how I would be received.
      </p>
      <p>
       I happened to stumble upon this post, and as a moderator of
       <a href="/r/changemyview">
        /r/changemyview
       </a>
       - I think this post is unfairly maligning the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       We never do content based censorship. We do however remove posts which do not fit our guidelines (responses must not be low quality, responses must not be rude or hostile, responses to OP must challenge their view in some way). We also remove obvious trolling attempts and soapboxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We allow threads on conspiracies, racism, paedophilia and what not.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get called Nazis roughly 3.14 times a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       So - about the title. It's an outright lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       The submission was never deleted from
       <a href="/r/changemyview">
        /r/changemyview
       </a>
       . The user (whose account no longer exists) had their post in CMV linked to from
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The user then edited their post and the edited post no longer reflected the reason why it was linked to originally. I think this is fair grounds for deletion.
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
       also stopped accepting submissions from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If this didn't happen and the user had simply posted in bestof in the link to their post in CMV, maybe the mods of
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
       should have reacted differently - but as far as I have been told - that is not what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       However don't quote me on the
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
       side of things. I have nothing to do with them, and I (and most of the mods) are frankly kind of annoyed then a submission gets bestof'd because it means that people come in and don't respect the rules of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the long term it isn't so bad because we gain new (rule abiding) subscribers who genuinely enjoy the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is one of the user's posts

       giving their thoughts about it

       I hope this is a satisfactory explanation of things - at least on the side of

       CMV did delete a comment because the OP edited it after it was guilded to reflect a comment that bestof censored.  CMV then did some CSS magic to reflect the original post by OP as well as the edit.

       issue.

       OP acknowledged that he used the post as a soapbox once it was submitted to

       If the edit was substantive and intended to deceive, it would be a reasonable reason for the mods deleting a comment (in my view), but I don't think you have adequately demonstrated the nature of the edit. What was different about the edited comment?

       I am not a mod of bestof, and I can't speak on their behalf - but the post was up for a long time before the removal and evidently the edit was substantiative. However, my main interest here is to defend the actions of CMV
