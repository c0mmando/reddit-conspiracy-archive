The military is involved in the recovery of the alleged UFO and witnesses have been detained. A complete blackout has been ordered by the government and some of the courageous people have been posting pictures and info online, but with their names blurred. Phone lines are also down. "

       Something definitely went down over in Winnipeg. Multiple eye witness accounts, photos of major military movement, and one person detained. Additionally, information is being covered up.

       The drill was named Arctic Bison and has been on the canadian military site from Febuary 17.  We have no proof anyone is detained, no actual eye witness testimony we can listen too.  This was either a hoax or a bad psyop... guess we will see what the claimed to be detained photographer has.

       Honestly, I will typically alternate accounts.  Sometimes I like to post fishing pictures, or pictures actively involved in my life.  I prefer to separate the submissions I make to the area I live, any personal info, and posts I make to shit like this.
       <br/>
       Judging people with the shit you've stated above is probably not the best indicator.  Check out one of my postings on this sub earlier.  It is a forum for people buying reddit accounts based on their criteria.
       <br/>
       Lastly, when people are pointed out as being shills, I typically observe their account age and karma to be high.  Like 2 years 3k karma/ commenting.

       Everyone does it, even in real life haha.  People don't like what they hear or see so they will do whatever to justify their position.  I have been around for 4 years or so( watching the Libyan crisis woke me the fuck up).  My last account I did not do this, it ended poorly.

       It's likely it was a training exercise with experimental aircraft. It would explain why you would have legitimate Training exercises posted from various outlets.  "What were those crazy lights and sounds we saw? ", "Oh just training exercises". I mean honestly look at how much they hid the SR-71. The first flight of the SR-71 was in 1964. It is still an amazing aircraft, and it is 51 years old. Think of what we have now that we don't know about.

       Guys this has been a planned in advance drill for the past 3 or 4 years that takes place every year around there in February, it's called "Operation Arctic Bison 2015" and it's about the Canadian military training in extreme winter conditions, this year it includes practice in recovering aircraft which have crashed or been shot down in extreme climates.
      </p>
      <p>
       These announcements were made weeks ago publicly about the plans for this drill(which this year was scheduled to include "recovery of downed aircraft in arctic conditions", so either it's a planned crash that people are taking out of context or a hoax centering around someone becoming excited about pre-announced troop movements that they happened to see outside their home and contact a "UFO youtuber" about):

       Pictures of a little black thing in the sky mean nothing to me - and what a coincidence the "aliens" decided to crash right where a pre-planned military drill including recovering downed aircraft in the snow was taking place, and where it's taken place in years before. If you want to keep going with the circlejerking about a UFO crash, have fun, but you might want to do a little research first before you choose to believe something! That's a heck of a coincidence.

       Just like the 9/11 drills, Boston marathon drills, sandy hook drills, London railway drills... There always seems to be drills going on when these big things happen. Everything is just a big coincidence, huh?

       This event was not a false flag though, unlike the others you listed. How would the government prepare for a UFO crash that didn't happen yet? Can they see into the future? I doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not a coincidence, it was announced beforehand. This was a planned exercise.

       So how does one define and/or quantify a new account?  Do these statistics indicate a threshold where account age then makes a user more trustworthy.  Again, not trying to be belligerent, but I'm curious if this is anecdotal or if there are hard numbers.

       Let's pretend time travel is real. If you sent something forward or back in time to a specific location, wouldn't you tell the public it is a drill weeks ahead of time?

       Yup that is what this is. I know someone that is there right now and he was actually saying that he was briefed on this today and they were remarking at how fast this was spreading.  He has been excited about this for months as everyone gets their own snow mobile.

       Did they not perform this drill on Jackhead Indian Reservation, where they do not have the legal authority?
       <br/>
       From my understanding the town consists of a couple hundred people, and wouldn't be the hardest place to cover something up.

      <p>
       They do. Do you know how? There are these things called "treaties" and "joint task forces" and "operational agreements", they amount to pieces of paper that two or more men sign, which gives this imaginary thing we call "legal authority" to the men with guns riding in troop transport trucks to enter a section on a map in Canada marked as "native land".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you're confused or what was complicated about that to you, but now I've described it for your benefit so that you can be better informed. The men with all the guns and gear go where ever they want to, they are
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       physical embodiment of the "legal authority" you're talking about. Military operations on indian reservations is nothing new or exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond all of that, who do you think decides what is legal? The men with all the guns and the chain of command that spans an entire continent and 'represents the will of canada', or some indians selling cigarettes out of casinos somewhere on a "reservation" granted to them by the men with all the guns?

       The things called "treaties" and "joint task forces" etc. are also worthless.  It seemed to me an answer that sufficed would be "Canada actually does have legal authority there."  But instead you told me I was heavily mistaken, and this situation is either complicated for
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       to convey, or a complicated concept to explain to anyone.  So based off of probability I presumed you were saying, "Canada actually does have legal authority there."

       I don't understand what is complicated to you about "the Canadian military has legal authority to go anywhere in Canada" and you are wasting my time and yours right now by being argumentative in a pointless way. Go use google if you are curious about the details of military use of "indian land" in Canada.

       those e.t. pilots travelling around the 'verse, unfathomable advanced technologies... and they crash their ships every few years on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       lets try to collect reasons for that particular scenario:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        E.T. pilots are useless in low orbit reconnaissance
       </li>
       <li>
        Earth is somehow different than any other planet and screws their navigation/propulsion system
       </li>
       <li>
        Our military has some secret means to shot down alien vessels
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       now, what's the most likely solution to our problem here?

       Well we have cars that have crash avoidance technology in them... its not a stretch at all to say that an alien species,  visiting our planet and trying to remain unseen, would have much more advanced crash avoidance technology or maybe a method to destroy evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they even use pilots? With the advances we have made in drone technology in just the last 10 years on this planet do you really think that a civilization thousands of years advanced ahead of us would be risking lives to send pilots on extensive missions to other planets? Ignore the possibility of new optic techonlogies and otherways to accurarely observe from outside our atomosphere, it would not make sense for them to send anything except a drone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of claimed crashes on this planet is just unreasonable for a highly advanced civilization. Why are they even doing missions here that often?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im all for questioning what is put out by the media, and thinking for yourself. I have no doubt that other life exists in the universe. Probability wise its close to impossible that there isnt. But use rational thought instead of massive logical jumps.

       Why do we still get inside submersibles or build rockets instead of using drones? It's more satisfying in person than through an electronic viewing screen. What, in your considerable experience with interstellar travel, leads you to believe it will remain prohibitively expensive for "thousands of years"? How do you justify the danger and expense of a mission behind the wheel of your car to the 7/11 for a half gallon of milk and a porno mag?

       Not every reported sighting could possibly be an alien craft means that none of them are? Are you sure that's the line of reasoning you want to go with in a paragraph that ends by making wild accusations about massive leaps in logic?

       How come our furthest travelling spacecrafts are always unmanned drones? The only benefit of a live pilot on research missions would be to do tasks more complex then our machines are able to. Thats also why we are constantly  working on new robotics to make machines more closely replicate our abilities. Unless your explanation is space tourism, i dont see your point. Interstellar navigation to new worlds isnt about personal satisfaction of seeing things in person. If space tourism is your justificafion well, we can each

       What proof do we have from even semireputable sources that this is an alien craft? This sub has a serious issue with link very sketchy sources as proof, which often or misleading, or downright innaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The likelyhood of an extraterrestrial species, which must live outside of our little neighbourhood in space that our satelites and drones have so heavily scoured, crashing on this planet for any reason is ridiculously low. Continuing that thought the likelihood of any crash or crashes this often being alien crafts covered up by the government is equally low if not lower. Not to say impossible, but i need a lot more proof then sketchy sources and unverified testimoney/pictures to convince me of anything, including the bullshit the media often puts out as truth.

        The number of claimed crashes on this planet is just unreasonable for a highly advanced civilization. Why are they even doing missions here that often?

       What if there are multiple civilizations visiting earth? Why must it be assumed they have perfected planetary travel.

       With the world now interconnected and everyone basically owning a camera in their pockets, I can't imagine things being hushed or controlled much longer by big brother.

      <p>
       It's getting to a point that disclosure is basically coming closer to reality as their only option for 'control' as far as their spin on the info. How do you stop people from exposing information in today's digital age? And how long can you if at all?

       This is not a very nice thing to say. Of course the odds that it's a drone, plane or some other boring thing are really high. That doesn't mean that you should be rude to people.

       The video is pointless anyways. The aircraft in the video is not the aircraft they are talking about, it’s just pictured during conversation.

       There are no videos avaliable yet, just a few pics of military involvement and that one that was tweeted.

       I'm sick of these comments. Address the content, then after that you can gripe about the the source. I'm not familiar with ThirdPhaseOfMoon, maybe you should summarize your complaints with them instead of just telling us we're idiots.

       I'm not the only one that thinks like this. I've mentioned this plenty of times in the past and generally got a positive reaction. Perhaps it would be better to have a [thirdphaseofmoon] tag then?

       Either way, you really need to look at their videos before passing judgement on me for my comment.

       I totally agree, but I don't agree with posting videos from a known youtube CG/View Farm like ThirdPhaseOfMoon - and if people don't know that they do this - that is absolutely fine, I'm just trying to educate (admittedly badly). No hate here, just a general "gosh another TPoM video).

       Research for yourself, I don't have the time to find sources for something you can do for yourself.  Whether you believe it or not is of no consequence to me.  I don't keep running tabs in a spreadsheet in case someone wants to believe a site is legit when its not.  We all have our own choices to make.  If yours is to say "he's full of shit, I trust this site" and go about your merry way, I couldn't care less about it.

       So I was sent a link to this page from my brother and upon reading it I instantly burst out laughing. Aliens? UFO crash? I myself was apart of this exercise and I can assure you this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. The so called UFO was a twin Otter search and rescue plane that was being used to provide assistance to ground troops while on the ice. Now I'm sure this comment will be down voted because the truth hurts but facts are facts. Howver if you don't want to believe this comment and are of those crazy people who are dead set on thinking this is real please e transfer me $5000 dollars and I'll create a lavish story for you involving E.T and Bigfoot

       So give us a picture of it on the ice? Remove all doubts.
So far the only picture is that of a pile of what looks like snow in a pyramid shape with a long trail leading to it.

       Do you have a source from more than a week ago stating there was going to be exercises on the lake? An entire community doesn't come together to make things up. There is a reason WITNESSES are a huge part of a Court case. Unless you can give a legitimate reason they should all make it up, your just part of a cover up. Or, more specifically, your family member is covering it up, telling you some BS that you would preech.

       That link is exactly what the exercise is about and everything that happened, there is no court case or witnesses. If you've listened to the radio interview the clown above posted the guy can't even give a solid answer, its filled with "I guess" and "something or someone said this" no concrete answers. The proof is in the pudding my friend doubt all you want but having been there I can say without hesitation nothing like UFOs ever happened.

       no not even close, but its not a legitimate concern, its usually used to distract.  Anyone that uses spelling in an article to discount it isn't really thinking, and in my opinion isn't intelligent enough discuss anything with, because if you(they) were, spelling wouldn't be a big deal ..its just an excuse.

       I think that it stems from the fact that I've studied journalism and have a communications degree. The issue, as I see it, is that poor grammar and spelling are an indication that the article was rushed and not reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it suggests that it's self-edited, which is a sign that it's not been vetted by anyone. All these things retract from credibility and make me question the content.

        UFO near Jackhead? It's actually a plane, says military
       </a>
       <br/>
       Members of the Arctic Response Company Group drive across frozen Lake Winnipeg during Exercise Arctic Bison 2015. (MCpl Cameron Skrypnyk/DND)
      </p>
      <p>
       "There's no aliens, just my friends in the air force who are out there helping us on this exercise," Davies told CBC News on Thursday.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have the commander of that air force contingent sitting right beside me and, you know, he assures us that that was not a UFO, but that was him."
      </p>
      <p>
       About 150 military personnel are taking part in Exercise Arctic Bison 2015, which includes the 38 Canadian Brigade Group, the 2nd Battalion of the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry, the 4th Canadian Ranger Patrol Group, and 440 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Davies said soldiers are training to deal with a plane crash and provide ground search and rescue support in the Arctic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bright light that people saw, he explained, came from an airplane that takes off very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       "From a distance it may have looked like it was going straight up in the air, but it wasn't," he said. "It was just us out there playing our games."
      </p>
      <p>
       The exercise wraps up on Sunday.

       False. I had family who participated in that training exercise, it had been planned for months in advance. The locals saw an increase in military and assumed something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Official comment from family member
      </p>
      <p>
       So I was sent a link to this page from my brother and upon reading it I instantly burst out laughing. Aliens? UFO crash? I myself was apart of this exercise and I can assure you this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. The so called UFO was a twin Otter search and rescue plane that was being used to provide assistance to ground troops while on the ice. Now I'm sure this comment will be down voted because the truth hurts but facts are facts. Howver if you don't want to believe this comment and are of those crazy people who are dead set on thinking this is real please e transfer me $5000 dollars and I'll create a lavish story for you involving E.T and Bigfoot

       There was no crash, you have locals making things up for internet views. I love a good conspiracy and it's almost just as entertaining to be on the other side of this one. The stuff people make up is out of this world.

       Infantry (PPCLI) it was an "artic exercise" over the course of 10 days. Soldiers had to survive the elements out on the lake (where it's "cold as shit" ) troops both American and Canadian had to be med evac'd out due to severe frostbite.

       If this is the truth, which sounds plausible at least, it should be worrisome that US and Canadian troops are running drills and tests in these conditions. Seems like they are testing and prepping in case there is a war fought in freezing climate. We've been fighting in the desert so long, that an ice war would be a tough adjustment. Know who it wouldn't be a tough adjustment for? Russia.

       I don't want this to come across like an asshole, but out of curiosity how'd you find this story? Your history doesn't show any involvement with r/conspiracy. I'm not saying you don't have another username that's active on conspiracy or maybe you are a lurker of conspiracy, but with some of the weird offers going around to buy usernames on reddit, your responses and involvement and closeness to this story raises red flags. Again, please don't take this as a witch hunt, pitchfork raising comment, just wanted to ask you a straightforward question. Thanks man.

       No worries, like I mentioned earlier I enjoy a reading good conspiracy theory especially if it is backed by solid data. It gives me a POV that I never considered before, whether I believe it or not. I read without contributing (lurker) but when I saw this I figured people would want to know the truth since I had family involved I figured I would give my 2 cents.

       Awesome. That's the beautiful thing about this place, people can leave what want and take the same. If someone doesn't like the story, they'll dig till they find a version that agrees with them.

       If there were indeed aliens that we have come into contact with on our own planet, I hope the government does keep that shit hush hush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within an hour of finding out that an alien life form with technologies that dwarf our own, there would be absolute panic. For many people, life would suddenly seem very insignificant.

       why?  What possible difference could that make.  Yesterday aliens didn't exist, today they do ..whats different?

       Well think about all of the people who believe that humans are God's devine creatures? How would they possibly react to proof of a much more advanced life form. Even if you don't believe humans are God's special creation in his image, then you are probably still going to suddenly feel as though your life and world has a lot less meaning than you thought it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of all of that I just said, just ask yourself this: What else has cause panic and brought out the worst in mankind? Hurricanes, power outages, L.A. Riots, black friday (lol), etc... It doesn't take much for us to have situations of panic.

       Maybe it's an Unidentified Frozen Object...yeah, I'll see myself out. I just creep this sub to scroll though the comments section which always offer a good read into how different people think, but I'm seriously surprised that no one has made that joke yet. It

       This is a distraction from the real issues of the Bank of Canada lawsuit, the fact that Canada is about to start educating your grade 1-3ers about faggots, and that Canada is introducing patriot act legislation.

       I have it on good authority that it is in fact the Canadian military's new

       C'mon sheeple!  Training exercise????  It is obvious what is happening here.  Sasquatch has fired the first shots in the upcoming man vs beast war!  This is obviously a downed missile shot by a group of well armed militant bigfoot stationed in the Pacific Northwest.  I for one welcome our new hairy overlords.

       Did you even
       <em>
        read
       </em>
       the article.  Typical.  You see, this Coun guy explains that Putin
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       being advised by reptilian aliens, but "Nordic" aliens have given him technology
       <em>
        all the way up on the level of US technology
       </em>
       and now he listens to them.  This guy should know.   He first had contact with aliens in the womb and has been banging them since he was 5!
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean shit the government won't even give any information on the "military craft"

        that nobody but the article mentioned

       .

       The guy who grew up in a haunted house thinks Coun is really brave for talking about this.

        Why do we still get inside submersibles or build rockets instead of using drones? It's more satisfying in person than through an electronic viewing screen. What, in your considerable experience with interstellar travel, leads you to believe it will remain prohibitively expensive for "thousands of years"? How do you justify the danger and expense of a mission behind the wheel of your car to the 7/11 for a half gallon of milk and a porno mag?

       How come our furthest travelling spacecrafts are always unmanned drones? The only benefit of a live pilot on research missions would be to do tasks more complex then our machines are able to. Thats also why we are constantly  working on new robotics to make machines more closely replicate our abilities. Unless your explanation is space tourism, i dont see your point. Interstellar navigation to new worlds isnt about personal satisfaction of seeing things in person. If space tourism is your justificafion well, we can each

Talking about massive leaps...

       Where did i say that? Where are you gettng these things from?

       Fact is many conspiracy theorists are idiots who quickly jump to the ALIENS! Idea to explain anytime something crashes and it gets cleaned up. I choose to try and be intelligent in my paranoia.

       We shouldnt trust the government/mainstream media.  Why should i trust some random dude on the internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       What proof do we have from even semireputable sources that this is an alien craft? This sub has a serious issue with link very sketchy sources as proof, which often or misleading, or downright innaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The likelyhood of an extraterrestrial species, which must live outside of our little neighbourhood in space that our satelites and drones have so heavily scoured, crashing on this planet for any reason is ridiculously low. Continuing that thought the likelihood of any crash or crashes this often being alien crafts covered up by the government is equally low if not lower. Not to say impossible, but i need a lot more proof then sketchy sources and unverified testimoney/pictures to convince me of anything, including the bullshit the media often puts out as truth.

        I'm presuming you are saying they do have legal authority everywhere in Canada.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They do. Do you know how? There are these things called "treaties" and "joint task forces" and "operational agreements", they amount to pieces of paper that two or more men sign, which gives this imaginary thing we call "legal authority" to the men with guns riding in troop transport trucks to enter a section on a map in Canada marked as "native land".

      <p>
       I don't know why you're confused or what was complicated about that to you, but now I've described it for your benefit so that you can be better informed. The men with all the guns and gear go where ever they want to, they are
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       physical embodiment of the "legal authority" you're talking about. Military operations on indian reservations is nothing new or exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond all of that, who do you think decides what is legal? The men with all the guns and the chain of command that spans an entire continent and 'represents the will of canada', or some indians selling cigarettes out of casinos somewhere on a "reservation" granted to them by the men with all the guns?

       What if I told you there were hundreds of thousands of people that were okay with the existence of other life outside of Earth, and okay with their own insignificance? What if I told you that understanding your own insignificance is the key to happiness?
