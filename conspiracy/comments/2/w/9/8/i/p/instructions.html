        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What you need to do right now, this minute is make a decision. Do you want to wither away a mediocre nothing or say fuck you to the powers that be? I invite to do the latter, here are a few simple things you can do to get started.</p>

<p>-Eat healthy, it doesn&#39;t have to be organic but stop eating the fast food and junk food</p>

<p>-Exercise, yeah it sucks most of the time but you will learn to like it trust me</p>

<p>-Stop watching television, there is a reason they call it programming!</p>

<p>-Read at least once a day, at least a few pages.</p>

<p>I promise if you do these 4 things regularly you will experience quite the difference. They try to poison your mind with advertising prompting over-eating and binge-eating and self-destructive behavior. they poison the food and make it taste abnormally good to encourage poor diet which if you consider yourself even halfway intelligent you would know that what goes in your body feeds your brain so of course that would be a crux of their plan. (why do you think obesity rates are so high??) </p>

<p>I just want you to be healthier and know that no matter what they try to do to you there are steps you can take, very simple ones that become the stepping off to something greater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks Man. I grew up on a farm, so if it doesn&#39;t produce food, it rarely makes it into the garden/veg patch. If you live in an apartment, there are still options. You can still grow herbs and stuff. Even if you have a nice big pot, say 1ftx1ft near a window, you can grow most things. 
Then again, I moved 100kms out of Sydney to get what I&#39;ve got. The bank offered me a slave-for-life amount of money for a tiny place near my work, I thought &#39;fuck that&#39; and got a place half the price &amp; twice as much room. Australian house prices are out of control though. I didn&#39;t get mine till I was 32yo. </p>

<p>Yeah I do, and one that only gets a couple hours of poor light a day since I live in the middle of the city - I want to look into my options though, I&#39;m sure there are some spices or something I could try growing at least.</p>

<p>I feel you on the out of control housing prices though, I live in one of the most expensive real estate markets in America and probably the world - and I pay way too much for way too little space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it depends. im a bit slack with proper crop rotation, so when we get stuff, we get a <em>lot</em>. i share it with my neighbours and preserve whatever we have stacks of at the time. i dont feel right selling it, so i usually give it away. at its peak, we were getting 8-10 cucumbers/day, so whatever we couldnt use or give away, we ended up juicing with a couple of apples. was bloody nice. at the moment were getting about 20-odd cherry tomatoes/day, 4-6 full size tomatoes/day, 1-2 egg plants/day, 4-6 strawberries(i forgot to photograph them) its a bit up and down. its really hard to put an amount on it. sorry, it just goes in bursts, but i reckon i could easily feed another 2 people. oh and ive got the watermelon and 3 pumpkin plants going too. pumpkin will get me through the rest of the year. </p>

<p>&#39;What I found was that the culprit was right under my nose, literally. Through articles and forums I learned that many people were starting to relate their sudden onset of joint pain with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). This struck a chord with me because at that point in my life I was a regular Mountain Dew drinker.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try a little juice topped with seltzer - a heavy dark, syrupy, sweet juice like concentrated dark cherry or pomegranate (or even prune - that&#39;s apparently what gives Dr Pepper its personality). I like dark cherry and a splash of lime to give it more zing. Like a healthy coke. Plus, the cherry&#39;s an anti-inflammatory which helps aches and pains and is fantastic for gout.</p>

<p>Now my recipe brain&#39;s going, I bet cherry and ginger in your seltzer would be better than ibuprofen...</p>

<p>4 Check, most of what I consume is through reading, not watching</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we are all fucked. Hence where beer comes in. We are Rome and we are burning, not much you can do about it. Sit back, enjoy your life and watch the show. I&#39;ve detached myself from it. Moved out to the sticks, have well water, got some beer, got my dog and internet. I&#39;m going to start bow hunting next season and in the summer I&#39;m going to perfect fishing. Even though I hate fish, but whatever. 1000x Better than hungry man microwave dinners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can all, the Agora, individually unite and gradually create that which makes their socio-economic contradictions obsolete. We can supersede their influence... Outgrow the status quo.</p>

<p>Everyday, more of us are strategizing and living out how we&#39;ll each uniquely end our cycles of slavery and self-emprisonment... We&#39;re starting to collaboratively learn how to make each and every control irrelevant.</p>

<p>We can open-source, collaboratively build a true civilization; metaphysically online via detailed schematics and video AMAs or QandAs, and physically with chapters of nonprofits, manefesting the foundations of economic necessity with incredible efficiency and report among our communities...we can shatter this paradigm. </p>

<p>Each of us must uniquely:</p>

<p>1)<strong>secede</strong> participation from that which is contradictory</p>

<p>2)use the system to <strong>nullify</strong> contradictions (work from within and without)</p>

<p>3)create businesses and non-profits that make contradictions obsolete - <strong>SUPERSEDE</strong> the Status Quo in your life and among communities</p>

<p>4)Use Open Source <strong>Emulation</strong> techniques to propagate such methods</p>

<p>We have been played like pawns in a game which enslaves us. We need to stop playing games and start building a non-contradictory civilization...</p>
