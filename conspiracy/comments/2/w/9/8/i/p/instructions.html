       What you need to do right now, this minute is make a decision. Do you want to wither away a mediocre nothing or say fuck you to the powers that be? I invite to do the latter, here are a few simple things you can do to get started.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Eat healthy, it doesn't have to be organic but stop eating the fast food and junk food
      </p>
      <p>
       -Exercise, yeah it sucks most of the time but you will learn to like it trust me
      </p>
      <p>
       -Stop watching television, there is a reason they call it programming!
      </p>
      <p>
       -Read at least once a day, at least a few pages.
      </p>
      <p>
       I promise if you do these 4 things regularly you will experience quite the difference. They try to poison your mind with advertising prompting over-eating and binge-eating and self-destructive behavior. they poison the food and make it taste abnormally good to encourage poor diet which if you consider yourself even halfway intelligent you would know that what goes in your body feeds your brain so of course that would be a crux of their plan. (why do you think obesity rates are so high??)
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want you to be healthier and know that no matter what they try to do to you there are steps you can take, very simple ones that become the stepping off to something greater.

       Good post OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eat as local as you can, and work on being as self-sufficient as you can while you still can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take care of your body, and more importantly, take care of your mind. This includes unplugging the TV, and even from

       Really good call man. It's good to see you beat me here to saying what you have. This is true stuff. I'm thinking of posting some pics to show how I'm actually trying enact these these sorts of things as you mentioned here.

       Thanks Man. I grew up on a farm, so if it doesn't produce food, it rarely makes it into the garden/veg patch. If you live in an apartment, there are still options. You can still grow herbs and stuff. Even if you have a nice big pot, say 1ftx1ft near a window, you can grow most things. 
Then again, I moved 100kms out of Sydney to get what I've got. The bank offered me a slave-for-life amount of money for a tiny place near my work, I thought 'fuck that' and got a place half the price &amp; twice as much room. Australian house prices are out of control though. I didn't get mine till I was 32yo.

       Yeah I do, and one that only gets a couple hours of poor light a day since I live in the middle of the city - I want to look into my options though, I'm sure there are some spices or something I could try growing at least.
      </p>

       I feel you on the out of control housing prices though, I live in one of the most expensive real estate markets in America and probably the world - and I pay way too much for way too little space.

       it depends. im a bit slack with proper crop rotation, so when we get stuff, we get a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       . i share it with my neighbours and preserve whatever we have stacks of at the time. i dont feel right selling it, so i usually give it away. at its peak, we were getting 8-10 cucumbers/day, so whatever we couldnt use or give away, we ended up juicing with a couple of apples. was bloody nice. at the moment were getting about 20-odd cherry tomatoes/day, 4-6 full size tomatoes/day, 1-2 egg plants/day, 4-6 strawberries(i forgot to photograph them) its a bit up and down. its really hard to put an amount on it. sorry, it just goes in bursts, but i reckon i could easily feed another 2 people. oh and ive got the watermelon and 3 pumpkin plants going too. pumpkin will get me through the rest of the year.

       I still love Coke and Pepsi. But cutting it out made me realize that it actually causes the craziest ankle and knee pains. I'll still have it once every few weeks, but then brace for the weird shooting pains.

       'What I found was that the culprit was right under my nose, literally. Through articles and forums I learned that many people were starting to relate their sudden onset of joint pain with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). This struck a chord with me because at that point in my life I was a regular Mountain Dew drinker."

       Try a little juice topped with seltzer - a heavy dark, syrupy, sweet juice like concentrated dark cherry or pomegranate (or even prune - that's apparently what gives Dr Pepper its personality). I like dark cherry and a splash of lime to give it more zing. Like a healthy coke. Plus, the cherry's an anti-inflammatory which helps aches and pains and is fantastic for gout.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now my recipe brain's going, I bet cherry and ginger in your seltzer would be better than ibuprofen...

       Dude, try stuff like La Croix. It's a little bit of an acquired taste since there's no sugar, but it's EXCELLENT for stepping down off soda. Once you're fine with no soda and you're good with La Croix, moving off it is just a small step.

This will be a key to self and community sufficiency that is often overlooked. We are the company we keep, we are the food we eat, and we are only as great as our community is strong. We need others in many ways and now is an important time to build and form strong bonds and connections with those around us physically ( not only Internet personalities ).

       1 I don't eat fast food or anything like that. Fuck, I like my beer though that's not "healthy"
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Fuck, I don't work out, but I'm not obese, I'm a healthy weight.

      <p>
       3 Check, stopped months ago

       4 Check, most of what I consume is through reading, not watching

       At the end of the day, we are all fucked. Hence where beer comes in. We are Rome and we are burning, not much you can do about it. Sit back, enjoy your life and watch the show. I've detached myself from it. Moved out to the sticks, have well water, got some beer, got my dog and internet. I'm going to start bow hunting next season and in the summer I'm going to perfect fishing. Even though I hate fish, but whatever. 1000x Better than hungry man microwave dinners.

       I haven't given up, I'm more American than 98% of Americans. But I'm also not dumb. I don't support what we do, people are lost. So lost, Fireworks for what? We got sold out in the early 1900's for a FED what do you know about US history? I'm not down. I'm making my way into the furthest regions of Alaska.No people, just nature. People are retarded and will continue this shit. Enjoy your life!

       He's right, and wrong. Both ways suck. If he stays he fights the brainwashed crowd. Consumption, social media, corrupt governments, and biased science are rampant. If he goes, he leaves what we all are fighting for. Community, healthier people, human contact, justice, equality. That's what its all about, but we have lost our way. We mustn't judge as those who have done the research know that his decision is probably the most rational one.

       I do all of these except I have to watch TV.. I pay attention though, I don't tune out. I love to watch the way the spin works, I admire all the adverts for ISIS and our patriotic duty to watch what our enemy is doing these days. Then I do squats until I shit my pants. It's a great way to burn off my patriotic fervor.

       Canceling cable and ending my TV watching has been one of the healthiest things I've ever done. It's still funny when people are incredulous to the idea I haven't watched the newest it-com or drama. It's like taking 6 months off booze and then drinking again. You go back to TV after a year and you realize how fucked it all is but when you're in it, it doesn't phase you. Now, I watch TV and ask "why? How and why does anyone watch this?"

       We can all, the Agora, individually unite and gradually create that which makes their socio-economic contradictions obsolete. We can supersede their influence... Outgrow the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyday, more of us are strategizing and living out how we'll each uniquely end our cycles of slavery and self-emprisonment... We're starting to collaboratively learn how to make each and every control irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can open-source, collaboratively build a true civilization; metaphysically online via detailed schematics and video AMAs or QandAs, and physically with chapters of nonprofits, manefesting the foundations of economic necessity with incredible efficiency and report among our communities...we can shatter this paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each of us must uniquely:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <strong>
        secede
       </strong>
       participation from that which is contradictory
      </p>
      <p>
       2)use the system to
       <strong>
        nullify
       </strong>
       contradictions (work from within and without)
      </p>
      <p>
       3)create businesses and non-profits that make contradictions obsolete -
       <strong>
        SUPERSEDE
       </strong>
       the Status Quo in your life and among communities
      </p>
      <p>
       4)Use Open Source
       <strong>
        Emulation
       </strong>
       techniques to propagate such methods
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been played like pawns in a game which enslaves us. We need to stop playing games and start building a non-contradictory civilization...
      </p>
      <p>
       Im working on this concept of
       <strong>
        Open Source Civilization Building Cooperatives
       </strong>

       i try to be healthy, but sometimes i just get a really bad craving for a certain fast food or sweet. i should exercise, but i dont think ive ever found an exercise yet that i truly enjoy and have fun doing. i barely watch TV, but when i do, its when im eating and i try to watch something funny or interesting, like a good movie, or the food channel with guy fieri's show, or seinfeld, the simpsons, king of the hill, or history channel's ancient aliens series lol. i used to always see whats on the news but 99% of it now is just so depressing and heartbreaking and so i just avoid it. and ive been reading this star wars novel "heir to the empire" every night its the most fun and addicting book i ever read in my life lol. but thanks for that op i definitely agree!

       Can I add that one should not seek to be happy. One should
       <strong>
        be
       </strong>
       happy right now

       Great post! I'm sitting here having a donut as I read "eat healthy" lol. I'm working on eating more organic, local, raw, non-gmo foods; it's tough but worth it.

       Exercise is fun, you just having to find something that is fun to you. I love belly dancing and zumba, not really something for you guys but you could encourage your ladies to give it a try.

       I enjoy watching TV and movies. I don't watch much of it and I can realize when it's B.S. they're spewing at me/us.

       I read Reddit, probably too much, I should buy some books.

       I'm also drilling all of these things into my young daughter's mind so hopefully she will be healthy physically and mentally.

       Get off Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
