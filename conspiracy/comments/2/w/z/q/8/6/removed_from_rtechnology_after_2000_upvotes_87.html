    <div class="md"><p>Running joke with who? Le reddit army? Reddit is the most right-wing social media website on the Internet. Right-wing libertarians were the first ones to start brigading other subreddits. Stormfront joined the libertarians to censor anything going against the right-wing hivemind including any and all posts about OWS and later full on attacks against liberals, feminists, any anyone else even remotely considered &quot;leftists.&quot; </p>

<p>Le reddit army started whoaverse in a lame attempt to start their own &quot;freedom of speech&quot; version of reddit (lol fail) and the first thing they did was ban any accounts that went against the right-wing circlejerk. Freedom of speech as long as it&#39;s right-wing, racist, and/or sexist. Texas logic! LOL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Voat.co was created by a group of disgruntled reddit users around a year ago. Evidently they had been monitoring posts and noticed certain politically charged posts being removed from the front page. They believed this to be an unfair form of censorship and created their own site that is explicitly against censorship and allows posts to move up and down the pages more &quot;organically&quot;.</p>

<p>I mention Voat.co because reddit seems to be a liberal news source these days. I prefer a more impartial news source (seems hard to find these days) and Voat.co sounds promising. In theory at least.</p>

<p>Want an example of that? Long ago Reddit banned <a href="/r/creepyshots">/r/creepyshots</a> because it grew too much and the main stream media started to bitch about it since the sub became too visible around Reddit. After the ban other subreddits that filled the same role as <a href="/r/creepyshots">/r/creepyshots</a> were created (such as <a href="/r/CandidFashionPolice">/r/CandidFashionPolice</a>), but since they are &quot;invisible&quot; right now due to the reduced user base the admins don&#39;t need to hide it.</p>

<p>Keeping censorship to a minimum also prevents a lot more people from even knowing there&#39;s a censorship problem while still allowing you to censor... that&#39;s the whole point of censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be very difficult to determine as there is no proof available. If you think logically about it though at least some are bound to be. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain; Reddit is one of the largest sites where people discuss current events and major news stories worldwide. If I were a CEO of a large company that was regularly involved in controversy or ethical grey areas I would sure like all of those people to think favourably of my company (or at least not discover any further skulduggery). Now you could just advertise but I would imagine that this is quite costly and doesn&#39;t really do much to change peoples preconceptions. If however you had some interns or casual employees whose task it was to &quot;protect the brand name&quot; online (read: bury the controversy, deny all wrongdoing) well then what logical reason would there be to not do that? It&#39;s not illegal, just a bit dishonest. The most effective way to do this is to gain moderator status in a somewhat relevant and popular sub so that you can effectively silence anybody who would argue to the contrary. When you consider this I think it would be rather flippant to assume that there aren&#39;t any mods who are shills. For a company that flouts environmental laws to the detriment of humanity in general or makes use of child labour in sweatshops it&#39;s not really a huge leap to presume that they would engage in activities like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The very fact that deletion of subjects exists at all in an environment where the user is fully capable of filtering what he or she wants to see is already crossing the line.</p>

<p>The future of social networking will not allow deletion of anything but rather for everything to be ever present while the user applies filters as the content is uploaded and through inflection from other users. In other words when you upload a post you describe what the content is and then people can then apply inflected details as they see fit.</p>

<p>I have had a lot of ideas about how this should work but once a system like this is in place nobody can control it and the responsibility of what you want to see is completely up to your discretion.</p>

<p>She joined Kleiner Perkins in 2005. On May 10, 2012, Pao filed a gender discrimination suit against the firm. On October 1, 2012, she left the firm. Her lawyer said she was fired in retaliation for her lawsuit. The firm said Pao was terminated for performance reasons unrelated to the lawsuit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lee said Kleiner was one of the first venture capital firms to hire women as partners. &quot;The number of women partners at the firm is one of the highest within the venture capital arena and the firm has actively supported women in all respects,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Pao married African-American money manager Buddy Fletcher in 2007. Fletcher sued his former firm, Kidder Peabody, for race discrimination in 1991 and eventually won a settlement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy.  It&#39;s not an exclusive &quot;either or&quot; type scenario.  One can easily talk against corporate science on one end while (usually unwittingly) defending propaganda on the other which not only suppresses <em>real</em> innovation and scientific invention, but which ultimately protects that very corporate establishment.  Stay at one superficial level and you can come across as and convince yourself that you are one who &quot;supports real science!&quot; - all the while you steadily rail against those real findings that corporate science and the corporate media tell you to ignore and not pay any attention to (because it goes against the status quo and hurts their profit margin).</p>

<p>No, not at all. My job&#39;s no where near that simple or sinister (elevator pitch is that we work to help scientists connect with the media to discuss their research and help the media find the most qualified scientists for their stories.)</p>

<p>Part of it though is staying on top of climate news, which means I read 6 different newsletters every morning. </p>

<p>Not part of my job duties but something I do for amusement is post to reddit the best of the 4 dozen or so stories I scan every morning. reddit&#39;s pretty much the only place in the world where people can make Koch jokes or have a pun-off based on climate sensitivity, or whip up amusing gifs at a moment&#39;s notice. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question for you though: If I were really an evil shilling propagandist, would I have used my actual name for a username, and then talk about things openly when it&#39;s brought up? Would I have requested flair in <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> and elsewhere? (Other subs don&#39;t give it.) </p>

<p>All I do is the same thing other redditors do: post links to things I come across in the course of my day. Does the fact that my job is the reason I come across those things mean I&#39;m not allowed to be a redditor? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then would you care to share with the rest of us which NGO you work for exactly so that we can trace the funding of that NGO and determine if there are any conflicts of interest?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So you find scientists that are doing work that aligns with your agenda and then promote their work to further promote the agenda of the NGO.  The more public pressure there is to support green measures, then the more money the companies that fund your NGO stand to make.  It&#39;s a disgusting tactic and the oil companies you proclaim to hate have been using this same tactic for decades.</p>

<p>Who funds this NGO?  I would bet that it is somebody that stands to profit quite a bit from &quot;green&quot; technology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not part of my job duties but something I do </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your NGO doesn&#39;t want you to continue making your garbage &quot;science&quot; posts on your work time or do they like that it brings more attention to &quot;the cause&quot;.  I do a lot of things that are not my official job duties either, but that does not mean they are not expected of me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>would I have used my actual name for a username, and then talk about things openly when it&#39;s brought up?</p>

<p>Using your real name doesn&#39;t mean anything.  Who cares?  The Clinton&#39;s are both liars and everyone knows their name too.  Keep trying to deflect, guy.</p>

<p>No, the fact that you do it to promote the agenda of your &quot;job&quot;, profit personally from it by being paid to do this on the &quot;job&quot;, and your employers stand to profit from the results of the dishonest propaganda campaign which you are employed in is what makes it not ok.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Who cares?  You&#39;ve already admitted that your employer pays you &quot;unofficially&quot; to post propaganda here.  You probably look at other things on the internet, too, but that has no bearing on your daily work/propaganda activities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would I have requested flair in <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> and elsewhere?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course you would.  People are idiots who believe that stupid shit like havig &quot;flair&quot; or mod positions give them credibility.  <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> is about as anti-science as you can get.  I am an actual chemist and their idea of science is a joke.  Science doesn&#39;t have to censor discussions, but people with agendas do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The incident began when a server used by the Climatic Research Unit was breached in &quot;a sophisticated and carefully orchestrated attack&quot;,[5] and 160 MB of data[8] were obtained including more than 1,000 emails and 3,000 other documents.[18] The University of East Anglia stated that the server from which the data were taken was not one that could be accessed easily, and that the data could not have been released inadvertently.[19] Norfolk Police later added that the offenders used methods that are common in unlawful internet activity, designed to obstruct later enquiries.[5] The breach was first discovered on 17 November 2009 after the server of the RealClimate website was also hacked and a copy of the stolen data was uploaded there.[20] RealClimate&#39;s Gavin Schmidt said that he had information that the files had been obtained through &quot;a hack into [CRU&#39;s] backup mail server.&quot;[21] At about the same time, a short comment appeared on Stephen McIntyre&#39;s Climate Audit website saying that &quot;A miracle has happened.&quot;[22]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t posted here in over two months because 90% of what I&#39;ve read here in the past two months is insane. It is people attacking others trying to have a balanced and logical conversation. It is taking things to the extreme with a THEORY that is pushed as FACT. Because people here seem to have lost all grip on reality and perspective. They have forgotten how to remember NAMES of people involved in SPECIFIC things. They throw around generalizations, and drops blanket assignment of blame to everyone they think has a bad tone of voice or they don&#39;t like. Because this place has degenerated from somewhere to have an open and uncensored discussion to a place where people scream at each other because someone else has a different take on something than you. </p>

<p>I am not part of a fucking brigade, I am someone trying to open people&#39;s eyes using LOGIC and REASON and FACT. For fucks sake, you are attacking a guy who is a member of an NGO trying to accomplish something THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE and because of this connection he is nothing but a shill? Man-made or not, climate change is a reality. And if you even want to go so far as to ignore that, ECONOMICALLY renewable energy is a smart move. Energy prices set the basic price for almost every good on the planet, if you can stabilize energy production and prices, it can help stabilize commodity prices. It removes the trading of a finite fuel source for energy production as a way to manipulate the economy and value of currencies. </p>

<p>Not to mention this is all in a thread about someone pressing charges for sexual discrimination. The character of Ellen aside, THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. That is not some fucking giant conspiracy, there are men out there who are sexist pigs. I as a man have to deal with them all the time. </p>

<p>You wanna point out someone funding NGOs doing bad? Look at the Koch Brothers, look at the Red Cross, and the IMF, or the World Bank. Point at someone doing something DESTRUCTIVE and call them out. Stop this bickering bullshit that does nothing but divide people. You are not the fucking savior, the swami, the prophet, or the oracle. You do not see what the future will bring any better than anyone else. </p>

<p>So if you want to come to the table and discuss what can be done about the fucked up shit going on on this planet, come to the table to TALK. Not bicker, and divide, and stick your fingers in your ear. </p>

<p>People in this forum constantly call shill and attack anyone disagreeing with them, you are the shill. You are the one who is being a poison to reasoned conversation. Unwittingly or not, people like you are the ones ruining reddit, whatever the subreddit is. </p>

<p>You simply saying &quot;it isn&#39;t a conspiracy&quot; without providing facts, logic, and reason doesn&#39;t make it true. You simply repeated the same thing you said before without addressing my response.
So yes.. fuck off... and go talk at yourself in the mirror if you aren&#39;t interested in hearing others.
actual <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users
Yeah.. the actual users were the ones being brigaded in that thread. Axolotol.. ronin.. ambiguously.. etc... All regular users. The biggest brigade I saw there was the JIDF crowd.</p>

<p>lol.. see.. i must have sockpuppet accounts if people could possibly agree with me. Just like the other guy said.. you&#39;re a psycho. And this isn&#39;t <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>... people don&#39;t like that shit.</p>

<p>Seriously... you&#39;re an idiot and your presence just drives people away. You prove over and over that you can&#39;t help but shitpost <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> quality stuff to this sub.</p>

<p>Go fuck yourself, you delusional idiot. You don&#39;t have one shred of credible evidence to refute me, so you turn to insults. So I will repeat: take your condescending attitude and shove it up your ass. Your writing was awful and disjointed, but that is for another conversation.</p>

<p>I get warned within 10 minutes of making one post, but Rainbow is allowed to go around personally insulting people for days? Pretty consistent modding there. EDIT: (Each block is from a different post, so context is clear)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re digging a deep hole here my friend. I&#39;m not even sure you can see how deep you&#39;ve gone. </p>

<p>As for this &#39;war on science&#39;. What seems to be the problem with this? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s make it clear what kind of science we&#39;re talking about. We&#39;re talking about the science that exploits. We are talking about the kind of science that develops weapons of mass destruction. The kind of science that rationalizes putting your life in the hands of authority figures and corporate giants. </p>

<p>The kind of science that is creating the techcnology that is dumbing down future generations. (And yes, I realize the potential is there for the opposite but anyone with a shred of common sense can see the worst is happening.)</p>

<p>The kind of science that puts pharmaceutical companies on top of the pyramid, and middle and low class people dependant on these companies for their sanctity. Mentally and physically. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re doing is conglomerating a very gray issue into something blatantly black and white. This is propaganda you&#39;re spewing. For a scientist you&#39;re very slim on actual facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting how when mods delete a thread due to &quot;title issues&quot;, you still can&#39;t resubmit the source link as a new post.  Mods could easily change the title on thread like that, but instead they censor it and blame the title.  Frankly this doesn&#39;t even break the rules unless they are saying that it was insinuating editorialization not implied by the article- which i think is questionable</p>

<p>As far as the article not being technology related- really?  Can <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> feature articles about women in the workplace?  What about payscale differences between companies and industries?  I think this story is going to be framed as being about women in Silicon Valley, and it might even say something about the culture being fostered at reddit inc.</p>

<p>I have to disagree there.  She may be a bit long in the tooth but she is a relatively attractive woman.  She doesn&#39;t appear to have masculine features, especially if you examine her neck and collar bone structure.</p>

<p>most redditors just really hate women because I&#39;m guessing y&#39;all have tiny dicks or women just won&#39;t even talk to you because you&#39;re reprehensible pieces of shit. </p>
