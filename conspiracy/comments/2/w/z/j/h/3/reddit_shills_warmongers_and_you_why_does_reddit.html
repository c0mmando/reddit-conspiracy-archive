        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Shills are a serious problem.  They exist.  They are not mythical creatures that only exist in your mind.</p>

<p>Every single person understands that Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Ag, and other companies propagandize, lie, and manipulate people in their pursuit of money and power.  Society has come to expect this behavior and nobody thinks twice about it.  We see the lengths that corporations, such as BP, go to in order to cover up their misdeeds.</p>

<p>The companies with the highest annual revenues top out with annual income of a little less than $500 billion dollars.  The US Government takes in annual revenues of approximately $3 trillion dollars.  The corporation of the United States takes in more than 6x that of the largest private corporation in the world.</p>

<p>Why would you not expect the government to have the most powerful, potent, and unscrupulous practices of any organization in the world?  It has income of $3trillion on the line and a monopoly on violence... that is one big, ugly business whose existence depends on the delusions of the citizens.</p>

<p>Why, then, if we must admit to ourselves that governments intentionally deceive their citizens to drive the agendas of the rich and powerful, are we not allowed on Reddit to address this fact and identify the individuals who choose to engage in this behavior?  </p>

<p>Is it because we are scared of harming innocent people?  We don&#39;t seem to have a problem harming innocent people in Iraq based on the lies these people have told us.  Are we doing more harm by not identifying the individuals perpetrating these crimes?</p>

<p>Just as people like Lloyd Blankfein and Jamie Dimon should not be able to hide from the responsibilities of their personal actions, we should not allow any individual to hide from their decisions.  </p>

<p>That person, whether working for a private agency, NGO, or for government, knows what they are doing and using your own money that you have paid in the form of taxation against you. </p>

<p>Does anyone actually consent to paying someone to lie to you?  I don&#39;t and I don&#39;t think anyone else does.</p>

<p>So why are we told we are not allowed to identify that behavior and name those individuals?  The only real answer is that Reddit is complicit in this behavior.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A not so simple answer. Reddit is owned by a for profit corporation. AFAIK, they make their money from some sort of ad revenue. For sure they&#39;re not making their money off of us.</p>

<p>That means we aren&#39;t their bosses, we&#39;re more like the product. Reddit is being offered as a platform for presenting the official narrative of TPTB to millions of online readers... the collective membership of reddit (ie. you and me). So reddit, as a corporate owned entity, has to act in it&#39;s own self interest and obey the hand that feeds it.</p>

<p>Just my own theory though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>I went through a phase where I looked down upon the FB crowd for wasting their time on that site being a product, and I was high and mighty and better than them.</p>

<p>Until realized that this place is the same format (or it is now, maybe it wasn&#39;t years ago). Sure, you can&#39;t see my face and don&#39;t know who I really am, but that&#39;s because the people who congregate here are probably more privacy focused to a degree and like it that way.</p>

<p>But we are no different. I&#39;m sure they sell some types of data. Just not tied to my actual real world identity (yet).</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Just for fun, impersonate a corporation with a large advertising budget (6 or 7 figures monthly) and get in touch with sales to see how aggressively they chase that &quot;ad revenue&quot;.</p>

<p>There is some other model.</p>

<p>It is probable that Reddit takes direct payments from governments or through their agencies (private contractors like Stratfor, who reddit is known to do business with).  That way, the government can pay the agency who then pays reddit to be able to promote its agenda and reddit can say that it does not bend to government influence because there is no financial paper trail directly between the two.</p>

<p>CNN does it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I were going to put together something like reddit as an organ of faux-democracy, I would require all payments to go through the &quot;gold&quot; system.</p>

<p>I would also run periodic promotions making &quot;gold&quot; so cheap that regular users would participate more often.</p>

<p>That way there would be a simple, straightforward answer as to how the thing is funded, much like political campaigns that go after $10 and $20 donations while running primarily on large contributions from organizations and oligarchs.</p>

<p>The other thing that would have to happen is that the person who gave the gold should be identified.  </p>

<p>Let me give you an anecdotal example:  I got gilded once for something that had to do with Fed Ex.  I was defending how they handled an adverse situation.</p>

<p>Was it Fed Ex marketing/PR that gilded my comment or was it an organic user?  I think you can understand the importance of that distinction.</p>

<p>I agree with everything you have to say except for this.  Reddit doesn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to do anything.  They choose to comply with these paid liars from corporations and governments because it&#39;s easy money.  </p>

<p>If we never hold individuals responsible for these choices that put easy profits ahead of citizens, then how will anything ever change?  </p>

<p>There had to be an individual that made the decision that they were going to be bedfellows with some of these groups.  If you are an individual who profits from or earns a living being involved in these immoral behaviors, then why should you be immune from criticism?</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t and know most of you would not accept payments that compromise basic human decency, so why do we continue to &quot;give a pass&quot; to those who do?  Should the goal of new businesses be to amass enough influence and power so that you can secure profits through governments?</p>

<p>Legality and morality are not the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s to be done about it though?  reddit is so easily manipulated, everything from the voting system (which has been greatly limited in its transparency), to the anonymity and ease of creating new accounts, to how simple it is to bury a post before it reaches the front page, to how much power admins and mods have and how little recourse users have to counter-act those powers, and on and on and on, and all of this under the guise of &quot;free flowing information&quot; and &quot;organically curated content&quot;.</p>

<p>You can say the same thing for other sites as well which discuss more &quot;fringe&quot; topics and are infested with trolls and shills.  It&#39;s an internet wide problem.  The golden rule: he who has the gold makes the rules - as long as there is money to be made deceiving people (and there always has been), there will be people willing to deceive.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m more curious about is what type of person would be so willing to sell out their common man.  Do they not realize what they&#39;re actually doing?  The type of future they&#39;re supporting?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the answer:  None of us know exactly.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem:  Reddit does not allow you to openly discuss examples of this behavior because they call this &quot;witch hunting&quot;.  The difference is that shills exist; witches don&#39;t.</p>

<p>So if we aren&#39;t allowed to openly discuss these individuals, then how are we going to come to some sort of consensus on how to identify and handle these individuals?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the kind words man.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t agree with you more but I think part of the problem is that if &quot;calling out shills&quot; was allowed, it would be abused.  Shills <em>themselves</em> would start using this to derail as many conversations as possible.  People like you and I would be called shills constantly, actual trolls/shills would be attacked even when they weren&#39;t saying anything bad and thus discredit the entire notion of them being shills, etc.  See what I mean?  I could just see it leading to an even worse environment than what we have now, or at least one that&#39;s comparable in its shittiness.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what the solution is.  Maybe if a few more paid shills felt a pang of conscience and revealed themselves then it wouldn&#39;t be so difficult convincing people that they exist.  Problem with this though is that having no soul is probably close to a pre-requisite for deliberately deceiving innocent people for money.</p>

<p>I agree completely.  Is the answer to this problem that we should just ignore it?  If we aren&#39;t allowed to go through the discussions about individuals and their actions and how to counteract them, then how will we ever resolve the situation?</p>

<p>It&#39;s kinda like saying &quot;If you learn to ride that bike, then you can get hurt.&quot;  This impulse to completely remove risk from everything is a dangerous one.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let fear determine your actions.  This is an issue that we should face head-on and not let others stifle the collective evolution on how to deal with it.  There is a solution to every problem and you can not create a solution without addressing the problem honestly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard out there. Being in a debt based system means constantly struggling to get by. This really is a massive force preventing all kinds of real change in the world today, and benefits almost no sectors of society aside from the 1%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m relatively new around here so forgive my ignorance, but I have an honest question. Why be so concerned about the shills themselves?</p>

<p>I mean, I understand your position completely. These low-life&#39;s take money from tptb to lie and manipulate the general opinion of the masses. I agree they ought to eventually meet some sort of justice for selling out their fellow man, but i wonder if, in this format at least, that justice is even ours to administer. Reddit seems to make it difficult to &quot;witch hunt&quot; these shills, and for good reason. There&#39;s probably a significant kick back for letting these shills use their platform. </p>

<p>But what I&#39;m saying is fuck the shills. We should worry about the every-redditor who would have his position changed by some propaganda spouting bullshit artist. They are the real casualties in all this. I think the first step in beating the shills is to educate everyone as to their existence, and then upon encountering one in the wild argue compassionately, respectfully, and logically while citing all sources. Then when our every-redditor friend reads the thread, he sees one level-headed and intelligent individual owning this stupid fucking shill in a debate. Who do you think he&#39;d be inclined to believe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes shills exist but more often than not its a misinformed user holding onto an old paradigm. </p>

<p>People give me a lot of shit in this sub for suggesting that when dealing with a shill its important to remain level headed and clearly make your points. Dont call a person a shill because you have already lost if you need to resort to that. </p>

<p>Present facts in a clear and easy way to understand because if its a shill you wont change his mind but you will change the minds of the people the &quot;shill&quot; is trying to influence. If its a confused user you owe it to your fellow man to educate them. And I mean educate not yell and get pissed off, really honestly try to educate. When was the last time you had a teacher that you listened to that called you names? Brainwashed, JDIF, Troll Shill etc will make the person you are talking to hate you and ignore all of the facts you are presenting. </p>

<p>Remain level headed at all times, be clear, be factually oriented and ffs do not call anyone a shill because it shows you cant debate your position. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we should call out shills. If they are spotted, then 1, it reveals/ruins what they&#39;re trying to do, and 2, it forces them to either backpedal (eating up their time) or to ignore the comment in a way that makes it even more obvious they are shills. Yes, it is dumb to immediately jump to calling someone a shill, but it&#39;s more applicable when the person clearly isn&#39;t interested in what you have to say (despite an extensive history talking on a bunch of similar posts).</p>

<p>Then we have to see impartial redditors and what their view is when they see a sub being aggressive and dismissive throwing around accusations of shill. They need to be on the peoples side not a government propagandist and when users are polite and speak factually the chances they will see your point of view grows drastically </p>

<p>I agree with this completely.  This is why we must address the issue honestly and collectively determine how to best stop this nonsense.  The problem will continue to perpetuate itself if we simply ignore it.</p>

<p>The biggest issue I have with your strategy is that most people are not compelled by facts.  Most people actually have a poor understanding of what constitutes a fact.</p>

<p>Does the State Dept. issuing a statement to CNN saying the Charlie Hebdo guys were totally muslim extremists make that a fact? I mean, this is a perfect example of a story where most people have already determined what the &quot;facts&quot; are before any narrative has reached the burden of proof required to declare something to be fact.</p>

<p>If people were driven more effectively by facts than by emotions, then the methods of Bernays would not be in use today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How nice of someone I have marked as &quot;questionable&quot; to join.</p>

<p>Can you tell us why the individuals who make the choice to get paid to do this type of work should be allowed to hide from the responsibility of their choices?</p>

<p>This is not a question of &quot;honest objections&quot; that normal users may have.  This is a question about how the people that choose to take money to lie to us continue to be protected.</p>

<p>Your solution of &quot;deal with it&quot; is a strawman in the sense that we should not have to &quot;deal with&quot; a government or dishonest company that would do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>It is not acceptable to intentionally put others in a bad position and then tell them they are dealing with that bad position poorly.  You are essentially excusing this behavior because &quot;shills gonna shill&quot; without making any attempt at resolving the issue of &quot;Why the fuck is our government paying people to lie to us?&quot; in the first place.</p>

<p>I really like how you used some very twisted logic to make shills everyone else&#39;s problem instead of blaming the low-life scumbags who would take money to do such a thing.  Your description of &quot;how you should handle them&quot; only works when you are engaging in honest discussions which is something that is actively worked against.</p>

<p>You are putting the blame and the burden on the wrong people.  Shills are something we should not have to deal with in the first place.</p>

<p>I dont believe that but because of the way reddit works I think that witch hunts looking for shills will be counterproductive. I agree you shouldnt take anything laying down, well most things, but I also disagree with your presumption that I said &quot;Deal with it&quot; and that it is a strawman. Just from my own personal experience debating with people on this site facts and being clear tend to surpass disinfo. </p>

<p>You need to calm down because I dont understand your solution (Which in itself is a straw man). I do blame the people engaged in lying to people, I do blame the people paid to manipulate opinion and my solution is to remain calm and factual when dealing with them (Anonymously mind you). </p>

<p>Let me toss a hypothetical to you, what do you do when you encounter a user you suspect of being a shill? How do you handle them? How do you know they arent a misinformed user? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is tricky indeed. Shills use the same talking points and strawman arguments. Its almost like they are reading off a script. They may however, be genuine users, so, the recommended practice is to be polite and level headed in your responses. Moreover, even if you recognize correctly that they are a shill, and call them out on it, they will never admit it, rather turn it around on you accusing you of calling whoever you disagree with a shill. Hence, calling out a shill is counter productive. Although, the temptation is real.</p>

<p>Shills could easily be ended, redditors would simply need to beat reddit at their own game and destroy the system in which they have created.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use unsearchable keywords for every thing that you comment on. (example lem0n instead of lemon, ging3r instead of ginger, etc.).  There are bots that search purely off of scanning for keywords.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the hive-mind approach.  Go into a somewhat political discussion and post numerous comments on numerous accounts that will satisfy whatever the advertiser wants.  Once all of your comments gets upvoted, change the content to what you were initially trying to say.  </p></li>
<li><p>Do everything that the shiller does except better.  Bring in 30 accounts and argue/upvote everything in your favor.  It is a lot of work, but annoying as hell to anyone trying to make a point against you.</p></li>
<li><p>If anyone is independently wealthy they can simply hire an overseas firm to counter-shill/ advertise your cause.  If enough people realize that every comment on an overly obvious propaganda post has the word &quot;shill&quot; spammed with a decent explanation of why, then people may begin to catch on.</p></li>
<li><p>Every advertiser has extensive analytics connected to their sales, views, etc.  If Reddit advertising loses it&#39;s credibility then they will simply have no market.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are independently wealthy and wanted to make a big change you could do something along these lines.  Hire an overseas firm to  create a bot that scans for particular linked keywords.  Copy all of these usernames that are obviously shilling over to a database.  Every single time this person posts, another created bot automatically finds them and downvotes them. Create hundreds of bots/ a simple algorithm and BAM. For short money this sort of stuff can be done in low wage/technologically advanced countries.  I&#39;m not sure what reddit does to counter these  bots, but I&#39;m sure all of the new hacks are common knowledge once they are found.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Study what they do, and figure out what can be done to counter every single thing that they do.  The only real way to get rid of them is to fight back HARD.  Sadly enough I don&#39;t think this will happen in the near future.</p>
