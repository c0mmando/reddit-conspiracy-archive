<p>Former PR worker here, 99% of our job is to convince people that something that is fucking them over is actually good for them. The whole concept of &#39;shills&#39; has somehow became a conspiracy theory when in reality it&#39;s just PR workers who are paid by a company to defend their product/service. My last job was defending fracking.
Anytime a post containing keywords was submitted to a popular website we where notified and it was our job to just list off talking points and debate the most popular comments. Fracking was an easy one to defend because you could paint people as anti-science if they where against it. The science behind fracking is sound and if done properly is safe, so you just focus on this point. You willfully ignore the fact that fracking is done by people who almost never do it properly and are always looking to cut corners.</p>

<p>Your talking points usually contain branching arguments if people try to debate back. For example my next point would be to bring up that these companies are regulated so they couldn&#39;t cut corners or they would be fined, all the while knowing that these agencies are either underfunded or have been captured by the very industry they are trying to regulate.
The final talking point, if someone called you out on all your counterpoints, was to simply try to paint them as a wackjob. </p>

<p>Suggest they are crazy for thinking agencies who are suppose to protect them have been bought and paid for. Bring up lizard people to muddy the waters. A lot of people will quickly distance themselves from something if it is accused of being a conspiracy theory, and a lot of them are stupid enough that you can convince them that believing businesses conspiring to break the law to gain profit is literally the same as believing in aliens and bigfoot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything arguing with the shills might help push their agenda.  They know their talking points and they know your arguments, and they are trained to make you look wrong.  It doesn&#39;t matter how much you know about the subject, they know a lot more about guiding the conversation to fit their agenda.  You may be helping them convince on the fence bystanders to agree with them while feeling like they just got both sides of the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good point.  I understand that.  Under those circumstances, the person you&#39;re communicating with has a specific stance toward only ONE agenda and perspective, and won&#39;t allow themselves to be swayed even while fully knowing they are wrong.  That&#39;s just plain evil, stupid, and despicable is what it is.  Very infuriating that someone would be willing to fuck their fellow human beings and, thereby, <em>themselves</em> in such a manner.</p>

<p>Basically any time a company gets caught doing something fucked up it&#39;s our job to minimize the damage, shift the blame, <strong>raise doubt</strong>, justify it, basically anything that will help limit the damage to the companies stock price.</p>

<p>This is interesting to me.  Was just listening to a podcast the other day.  Guy who made the documentary FrackNation was talking about this.</p>

<p>He said that it didn&#39;t matter what points were brought up by the fracking companies.  What mattered were that points were brought up,   no matter how ridiculous.  The oil companies would bring up nonsensical counter arguments, simply so that they could say that there was an ongoing debate on the subject.  </p>

<p>As long as they can say that there is an ongoing debate on the subject, most people will decide that it is too complicated of a subject to look into and see who is right and who is wrong.  </p>

<p>I thought it was brilliant really.  How many times have I been turned off to the truth of a thing, simply because there was an ongoing debate on it.  Many times, I wont even look into a topic.  I just take the wait and see approach to it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you know what&#39;s funny is that the people who come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to spam it with neo-nazi shit and nazi apologism and holocaust denial use <em>all</em> the <em>exact same tactics</em> that this guy says come right out of the shill handbook, same as the JTRIG online manipulation/deception/dilution/distraction guidelines.</p>

<p>You can kind of tell they aren&#39;t really invested personally in the beliefs they post here, but they will use these &quot;branching arguments&quot; so that you can never pin them down and stop them from being stupid(deceitful) or stop them from continuing, because they&#39;ll just branch out with some new thing they copy and paste from a neo-nazi website to associate online conspiracy communities with disinfo/misinfo/discrediting bullshit - while never actually engaging in rational conversation or debate beyond the pre-ordained tactics/scripting.</p>

<p>This is happening here on this website right now. Go to <a href="/r/new">/r/new</a> and look at all of it, there are posters who are dedicated to flooding <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with neo-nazi trash that&#39;s <em>just</em> &quot;on the fringe&quot; enough to not get them immediately called out or banned for it, and they don&#39;t care about it enough <em>personally</em> to really defend their positions or philosophies(which is probably because they probably don&#39;t actually hold those positions or philosophies and they&#39;re just trying to discredit a &#39;conspiracy&#39; community on a major social media website by associating it <em>just enough</em> with bullshit that manipulates the perceptions of the people using the website against taking anything here seriously - and against &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; or worldviews which are alternatives to the mainstream seriously).</p>

<p>This is how &#39;the truth&#39; and meaningful content is combated by the criminals with lots of money - by associating it with so much bullshit that no one outside a dedicated few can find it, or so that people don&#39;t take it seriously even if they do find it via filling in these types of communities with so much bullshit that 90% of everyone just ignores everything that comes out of them, and the other 10% are swamped with shit all day to the point of a complete break down of the ability to intelligently respond or organize their thoughts or views of the world - which is basically exactly like what is outlined in that &quot;Quiet Weapons for Silent Wars&quot; worksheet thing, whether that&#39;s legit or not as a &quot;leak&quot; it certainly is accurate.</p>
