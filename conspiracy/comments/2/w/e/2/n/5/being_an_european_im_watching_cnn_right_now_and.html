<p>I&#39;m serious too. This was one of the top headlines on r/worldnews yesterday. It seems like every day there&#39;s more and more of these ISIS headlines. The one thing they have in common is that they all seem carefully calculated to generate the maximum amount of outrage.</p>

<p>Ten or twenty years ago, executions would have been enough. But today&#39;s public has gotten so desensitized to violence. So TPTB have found it necessary to go to a whole new level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im from the UK and MSM here is full of BS - I haven&#39;t watched the &#39;news&#39; on tv for years and only read a saturday paper for the columns. The sad thing is that probably 90% of people who do read and watch MSM believe it which makes it near impossible to change opinions and make others aware of the real agendas that tptb have.
I toook the red pill when i got online in 99 or so and sometimes wish I hadn&#39;t , I have a very open mind and my mantra of seeing is believing brought me to my first interest, chemtrails, as a week after reading about them I saw two huge ones over my house - but even when you point them out to others all you get is a shrug or &#39;thats just contrails&#39; etc. So trying to inform friends and family about the false flag attacks that happen or the toxic chemicals in food leading to the real reasons for obesity (things like aspartamine, high fructose corn syrup that screw up your metabolism and stop you feeling full.... remember the old joke about eating a chinese then feeling hungry again an hour later? MSG and its still abundent , just goes under different names).
I don&#39;t know what the reasons are we plebs are in the state we&#39;re in maybe it is to get the population down to 500m - that would certainly be great if you were in that catagory.
My worry at the moment is Putin a mafia boss with huge ego and narcasitic undertones who runs a huge empire with the ability to fire nukes...there is so much danger out there one way or another all one can do is live a day at a time - makes it very very hard to bring up a family and hold down a job when you realise that your one life on this earth is 1/3 sleep 1/3 working for the man (in most cases) and 1/3 worrying about what is and might happen.
If there are other beings watching over us I hope they step in and teach how harmony can be achieved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what always makes me laugh about people who tout Fox as some kind of industry leader because of ratings. </p>

<p>You know when I see Fox NEWS? Walking through an airport midday, all the sports bars have every television blaring it and no one&#39;s paying attention. I used to work for a security company and it was a written offense to change the breakroom TV from Fox News. Most people just wore headphones or lunched in their car. Even where I work now, someone powers the TV on in the morning and sets it to FOX in our break room, but they&#39;re never present when I get here and I&#39;m one of the first people in. Invariably, someone else comes in the breakroom, scowls, and changes the station. </p>

<p>Yes, Fox has ratings, but I&#39;d be willing to bet a large chunk of those ratings are ignored boxes screaming into office or lounge spaces with not a single eye or ear captured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the states is putting it back on the books as a legal method of death penalty. If you&#39;re gonna have the death penalty at all, I&#39;d rather have the gas chamber than lethal injection with untested drugs that take 40 minutes to kill someone while they&#39;re awake and in visible agony. European (I think Italian) drug makers discontinued the manufacture of the drugs that had been used, so in some perverse way they actually helped cause the reinstatement of the gas chambers here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that had the Italian suppliers not discontinued the drugs, the US states would still be using lethal injection, and would have never proposed the gas chambers. I agree that the fact that the state kills people in cold blood is completely the fault of the legislators and the electorate.</p>

<p>I oppose the death penalty, period, and I ultimately think the suppliers made the right call. I think it will (hopefully) pressure the states into eventually ending the barbaric practice. But their decision is what prompted Oklahoma to consider using the gas chamber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say that CNN and other TV/radio outlets have infinitely stepped up the fear mongering and propaganda in the past 5 years. They&#39;re competing desperately with the internet, as more people move to online sources for information and entertainment. So, the &quot;news&quot; needs to keep you hooked. Look at what NPR has become, it used to be alternative/niche reporting. Now, the subtle attempts to placate the listener&#39;s ego is all over the place. </p>

<p>When I go to the Y, the Dr&#39;s office, the restaurant that has a TV, with tickers and headlines, I sit where I cannot see or hear it. I literally lost my appetite the last time I could read the screen, while eating. It was stupid and frightening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny in a way what we&#39;re watching in real time. The main stream news outlets were corrupted by money, it&#39;s the nature of capitalism. Now they&#39;ve created a hole thanks to their greed, a powerlessness, a new way to enforce the status quo.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how it started, but the serious oversaturation of the market needs to be considered first. The fact that there are multiple markets competing to give the same facts in the most profitable ways has led to the surge of sensationalism, click bait articles, and a rush to publish before facts are properly checked. Each competing outlet has to outperform its competitors or their business is doomed to fail. This rush, rush, rush creates a vacuum in which real news suffers in a lot if ways. When advertisers get too big to piss off, stories get swept under the rug.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s how it began, a happy accident that has been preyed upon by our leaders. It&#39;s come to a point where we can no longer trust the greatest mediums for communicating ideas to the general public. The public turns a blind eye because they assume their source of news is legitimate, it&#39;s only the competitors that are full of shit.</p>

<p>Now people look for even more alternatives to an already seriously oversaturated market, and so the news gets progressively less reputable. Sources from non journalists, people who didn&#39;t even go to college, or articles written by damn near anyone can get lauded and picked up by the other outlets and broadcast as truth long before anyone fact checks anything. This vacuous idea that expediency of news coverage supercedes the need to verify first has compounded the problem, and in doing so has left a door wide open. This door can be opened by any special interest group with enough time, money, and dedication. </p>

<p>Naturally, intelligence agencies are interested in exploiting this, as are politicians and many others. This is all simple, common knowledge that is available, but there is no real alternative. You can find smaller outlets that are likely more dedicated to exposing the truths about the powerful, but simply don&#39;t have the resources to investigate. Those with the resources to investigate cannot or they have the potential to lose all of their resources. It&#39;s a beautiful catastrophy in slow motion.</p>

We all know that it is Greece&#39; fault (with the help of Goldmann Sachs). As if a debt crisis can be fixed with saving and privatization. Ask Roosevelt how he fixed the 30s crisis for the poor south. The new deal. By normal keynesian investments, e.g. bringing defense industries to the south, not by killing them off, as the troica wants to do it with Greece.
Greece is asking for a new deal, but the banks have no idea about economics and want to loose all their investments. This is getting ridiculous.</p>

<p>At least the european media should be balanced and informed. We all know that US media is non-free and corrupt, even NPR is a pure state dpmt announcement organ via BBC Worldnews.</p>
