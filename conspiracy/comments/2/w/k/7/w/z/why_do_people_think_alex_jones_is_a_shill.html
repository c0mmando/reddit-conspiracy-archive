       This is a serious question.  I used to check out his site somewhat frequently, now I spend that time here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  I totally get that he is a sensationalist, and he makes a shit ton of money advertising products and stuff on his site and radio show, and he is a big mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't get is how people think he is a shill or somehow working for TPTB.  Why would TPTB want a guy like him constantly shouting about things like 9/11, vaccines, countless other topics.  If I am not mistaken, he has more listeners than Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, etc. and his website is listed by Alexa as being in the top 3400 worldwide and top 1300 in the USA, pretty respectable numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am not really a fan of his, and I am open to your comments, help me understand why people think he is a shill please.

       I dont agree with this dude often, but he seems fairly dedicated to this kind of topic. Also, he might not be the nicest or most polite, but again, he might be able to point you in the direction you are looking for... Its worth a shot at least.

       Most obviously, he rarely mentions Zionists -- instead preferring "Globalists".
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, his role is to associate real revelations with crazy ranting conspiracy loons in the mind of the average American, so they will reject  on emotion alone. It's similar to how the hippie movement was astroturfed to make the anti-war movement look distasteful to average Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the role of "good guys" who associate with Alex Jones -- such as Joe Rogan
       <sup>
        **
       </sup>
       -- is to make AJ look benevolent to his fans, if a little looney. He can't be associated with the banker cabal or the whole ruse falls apart.

       He is considered a "limited hang-out" by many.  Does a lot of talking on stuff everybody knows, avoids specific issues, disinfo on other issues, possible connections to organisations known to be fronts for powerful people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell, the higher-ups pay some people / organisations to control what is disclosed, and discredit the stuff that gets too close to the truth. For instance, I have heard him discredit without any logical reason Dr. Judy Wood on her 9/11 theories, and this is the drop in the bucket  convinced me he  fits the above description.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gives the masses a false sense of empowerment,  and real solutions are never put forth.

       Jones won't criticize Jews. He won't even acknowledge that Jews run Hollywood, something so obvious that Jews themselves don't bother to try to deny it. He won't say that the entire American mass media is owned and controlled largely by Jews, or that they use it to promote a pro-Jewish message. He won't admit that Jews have bribed and control Congress. He never says that Jews control the universities and set the agenda on the propaganda that is pumped into the minds of white Christian students. Jones will criticize almost everything, but never Jews. He won't even criticize Zionism, the evils of which are apparent to all.

       I agree, and I still go to his site occasionally.  He is obnoxious and it's annoying to listen to him sometimes, how he talks over people and all that.... But, he does get the word out about a lot of topics that no other famous person talks about, and I think that's a good thing, so that's why I don't understand why people think he has some sort of "double agent" agenda.

       At this point, he's so big that I believe he's had to sell out to someone. There are lines that he will not cross and he also has relationships with Stratfor as was shown in the Wikileaks GI files. But I still think he means what he says and really does think he's fighting the NWO (some will argue that he's playing into their hands or even consciously helps them by acting so over the top, I just think it's his personality).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, if anyone ever criticizes you for listening to him, just say "Go watch Police State 2000. Or go watch Revelations and Warnings." AJ was called a psycho in 1999 for saying that the police will be para-military forces (which they now are). So decide for yourself whether to listen or not. Sometimes for me, even though I agree with everything he's saying, he'll just be ranting to the point that it will make you stressed for the rest of the day. If that is happening, I think that would be a reason not to listen.

       If he was actually even
       <em>
        remotely
       </em>
       a threat to TPTB he wouldn't be allowed the platform he has.  Do you think just any old asshole can walk up to Bohemian Grove with a camera and start filming people and rituals?  Gimme a break, so obvious that he's been co-opted (if he wasn't to begin with), and that's without even getting into his shady connections with Stratfor.

       Having said that though, his site still has some good information on it sometimes.

       He is controlled opposition for those whose are a little more militant. Just like how Glenn Beck is controlled opposition for those who are a little more conservative. TPTB have controlled opposition of both sides of the spectrum in the "alternative news". But, both people will never talk about Zionism and call it out for what it is. That's how you know they are controlled opposition.

       Its a serious question..  people here bash him quite a bit but I wanted to hear the various reasons why people do not like him and/or believe he is a shill.  I don't really care for his personality but his site has interesting articles from time to time.

       I think the system has a good side and bad side. The good side in mainstream have to spew some bullshit to get out some truth. Its so everyone is discredited and ppl generalize so when Jones caters to the extreme right with his immigration talk ppl right there will discredit him and say hes racist and he might be but he does speak some truth. Everyone does it. Its the only current way to get the truth out while having to be fucking batshit crazy unfortunately but it isnt all cut and dry in my opinion. Extract the truth weed out the bullshit from everyone
