<p>Its quite ignorant to believe that the entire sub is represented by just a small proportion of its members. That sounds ironically like discrimination to me. </p>

<p>But, to each his own. Leave if you want. Btw, if you want help in figuring out who the worst offenders are (and who make the vast majority of those posts you are concerned about), then i would recommend lurking on <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a>. </p>

<p>Top 3 today?  The thread in question and an article about organic food sales.</p>

<p>Top 3 this week? A quote from Edward snowden talking about the good ol days rather than releasing the mountains of evidence he&#39;s supposedly sitting on.</p>

<p>Top 3 this month?  TSA agents stealing things and Russell Brand masturbating.</p>

<p>Top 3 this year? A meme, which breaks rule 8.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t like it either; but it&#39;s not new and it&#39;s not shocking.  Mods won&#39;t even enforce rules, they aren&#39;t going to enforce vague content guidelines and the community won&#39;t either.</p>

<p>Back to my comment: I clearly wasn&#39;t saying there&#39;s no brigading, I&#39;m asking people to wonder who is brigading and why.  There are accusations of it being racists or people attempting to paint the sub as racist and I&#39;m saying it&#39;s people who want you to leave the sub behind, like the original poster of <em>this</em> thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;m here to tell you there are plenty of real racists and pretending that just because they are racists they are wrong is the height of ignorance: even a stopped clock is right twice a day.</p>

<p>This sub took the brunt of the 4th exodus from /pol/ and they brought over their levitious attitudes which are generally unappreciated here.  The pervasiveness of jewish involvement in world and media affairs is so absolute that they long ago abandoned proper decorum when discussing jewish activities, such as this subs strong preference the word &quot;zionists&quot; and desperate attempts to avoid appearing racist.  If the opposition has no better recourse than to call them racist and ignore their claims, shouldn&#39;t you take it upon yourself to research their claims?</p>

<p>These people are genuine, they just don&#39;t care what others think of themselves or this forum.  Call them selfish if you want, but they are hardly disingenuous.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy, to me, is that it is a cultural indoctrination that Jewish people go through that creates a constant desire to portray themselves as victims to hide from criticism and gain power.</p>

<p>If you think I hold these feelings for Jews alone, then I am more than willing to discuss the horrible problems that exist among other cultural groups.  I have problems with any system of power that makes its adherents irrational.... no religion is immune from that criticism.</p>

<p>Think there are serious cultural problems in Islam?  You bet there are.  Same with any other cultural group.  There are even certainly supremacy problems amongst WASPs!  In my lifetime, it has been acceptable to be open and honestly critical of every race and religion except for one.  I think it&#39;s time we stop trying to dictate to people what they are or are not allowed to think or talk about.</p>

Until you meet a kabbalist who hates homosexuals but is an active homosexual - who is ruining shit around you by exposing private moments of your life because he wants to keep a german evil spawn in check from discovering his creative powers - because he doesn&#39;t deserve it.....  then you gotta question wether that jew spawn is just trying to justify his own fear and abandonment issues with violence or whether he believes that the german spawn cant be allowed to create because the last time he ate the jew. </p>

<p>Jews hold the strings of money and media and military power and information.  They are the keepers of the myth and holders of the power.... So they get to set the values. Thats it. You bow down to your jew overlords or you die. There is no middle ground. Every person that stood up to a Jew got powned by metaphysical powers eventually. David beats Goliath. Jesus beats death.  Noah beats a flood.  Jews survive. Jews got aliens on their side.</p>

<p>Or so they believe ;)  Really they are just able to love people other than themselves. Thats their power over demigods. And with that power gives them immense insight. </p>
