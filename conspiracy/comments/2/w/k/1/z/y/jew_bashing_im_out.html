       Ya'll have taken the idea that Jewish control of all things to a personal level that doesn't contribute to that conversation. I'm a fan of thinking about what types of hidden controls exist in the world, but posts like "Jewish Student Writes Anti-Semetic Note on Own Door then Claims Anti-Semetism" are just lazy.
Best of luck figuring out the reality of things. I'm going to go away and figure it out for myself.

       The post OP is mentioning looks like serious brigading to get it up to the top.

       Are we at a point where the "good guys and gals" need our own bots to counteract the vote-rigging? ( I seriously hope not, cause who's got time for that kind of metalame drama?)

       You're letting the vocal few win by running away.  There is a very vocal active group that has allowed thier Zionist hate suck in all Jewish people.  It got me really mad and banned for calling out a racist 2 yrs ago.  Since then I learned to spot the racists and adjust my research on this site accordingly.  Quitting only hurts you.

       With over a quarter million subscribers, we are bound to get those users who will abuse our sub for their own purposes and to disseminate their own beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its quite ignorant to believe that the entire sub is represented by just a small proportion of its members. That sounds ironically like discrimination to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, to each his own. Leave if you want. Btw, if you want help in figuring out who the worst offenders are (and who make the vast majority of those posts you are concerned about), then i would recommend lurking on
       <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">
        /r/isrconspiracyracist
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       While i dont like their premise, nor do i like many of the users there, they do have quite the database of the users in this sub that make up the majority of "jew-bashing" in r/conspiracy.

       Big question I have - these posts show up every once in awhile by users who aren't even active in the sub. I'd put good money on the same people posting racist stuff and vote brigading it to the top as those posting "I'm out."

       An observation based on what though? I vote (green, just to fuck with the main parties) and have been incredibly 'activist' in the past though I've calmed down a bit now, I'd be surprised if a large amount other regulars weren't similar. Perhaps you assume too much.

       I dunno, you'd think either one would've been taught how to maintain and use multiple user accounts simultaneously. Not to mention how to score higher karma levels to look more reputable. I notice a lot of dedicated shills have months and months of sports and gaming posts before they feint left or right. This serial and dedicated trolling thing is interesting and different and honestly, kind of entertaining as while it's definitely annoying, it feels harmless.

       It's not a conspiracy, it's old news, and there are very few sub regulars commenting there. The number of votes is ridiculously fishy. You know it's to discredit this sub and you have to wonder who's truly behind it when you see more upvotes for videos about stupid college girls than, you know, actual conspiracies like

       Top 3 today?  The thread in question and an article about organic food sales.
      </p>

       Top 3 this week? A quote from Edward snowden talking about the good ol days rather than releasing the mountains of evidence he's supposedly sitting on.

      <p>
       Top 3 this month?  TSA agents stealing things and Russell Brand masturbating.

       Back to my comment: I clearly wasn't saying there's no brigading, I'm asking people to wonder who is brigading and why.  There are accusations of it being racists or people attempting to paint the sub as racist and I'm saying it's people who want you to leave the sub behind, like the original poster of

       It sounds a little out there and meta, but I am beginning to believe that there are actually a lot of "pretend racists" trying to manufacture concensus in certain ways and smear up conversations. You can tell because they'll argue about stupid conspiracies related to the races they supposedly dislike (like this old news about the attention-seeking college student), but won't engage on any actual conspiracies.

       This sub took the brunt of the 4th exodus from /pol/ and they brought over their levitious attitudes which are generally unappreciated here.  The pervasiveness of jewish involvement in world and media affairs is so absolute that they long ago abandoned proper decorum when discussing jewish activities, such as this subs strong preference the word "zionists" and desperate attempts to avoid appearing racist.  If the opposition has no better recourse than to call them racist and ignore their claims, shouldn't you take it upon yourself to research their claims?

       These people are genuine, they just don't care what others think of themselves or this forum.  Call them selfish if you want, but they are hardly disingenuous.

       There are racists, sure. Everyone's a racist. But what I'm saying is that if you claim to be such and only put forth the most ludicrous stories in an effort to hide the important stories, you may not be who you claim to be.

       The conspiracy, to me, is that it is a cultural indoctrination that Jewish people go through that creates a constant desire to portray themselves as victims to hide from criticism and gain power.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think I hold these feelings for Jews alone, then I am more than willing to discuss the horrible problems that exist among other cultural groups.  I have problems with any system of power that makes its adherents irrational.... no religion is immune from that criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think there are serious cultural problems in Islam?  You bet there are.  Same with any other cultural group.  There are even certainly supremacy problems amongst WASPs!  In my lifetime, it has been acceptable to be open and honestly critical of every race and religion except for one.  I think it's time we stop trying to dictate to people what they are or are not allowed to think or talk about.

       I upvoted the Israelis vaccinating the Ethiopians into infertility and will continue to do so when I see it. Because that is a fucking conspiracy, full stop, and it needs light shined upon it.

       But a stupid video about a dumb attention seeking college student? It's not a fucking conspiracy. Plus, the event happened five years ago - it's old news, not a conspiracy--it shouldn't have been posted on this sub to begin with and there is no fucking way that it was organically and legit voted to the top of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       Rampant antisemitism by agent provocateurs is a great way to discredit and derail any legit questioning of the truly evil forces at work. Yes it has been found that some, some, of those people are Jewish. But all groups have bad apples in them. everyone needs to realize this. It is irrational to blame an entire people/group based on the actions of some.

       Hey. You can call it Jew Bashing all you want. Until you meet a kabbalist who hates homosexuals but is an active homosexual - who is ruining shit around you by exposing private moments of your life because he wants to keep a german evil spawn in check from discovering his creative powers - because he doesn't deserve it.....  then you gotta question wether that jew spawn is just trying to justify his own fear and abandonment issues with violence or whether he believes that the german spawn cant be allowed to create because the last time he ate the jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews hold the strings of money and media and military power and information.  They are the keepers of the myth and holders of the power.... So they get to set the values. Thats it. You bow down to your jew overlords or you die. There is no middle ground. Every person that stood up to a Jew got powned by metaphysical powers eventually. David beats Goliath. Jesus beats death.  Noah beats a flood.  Jews survive. Jews got aliens on their side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or so they believe ;)  Really they are just able to love people other than themselves. Thats their power over demigods. And with that power gives them immense insight.

       This sub took the brunt of the 4th exodus from /pol/ and they brought over their levitious attitudes which are generally unappreciated here.  The pervasiveness of jewish involvement in world and media affairs is so absolute that they long ago abandoned proper decorum when discussing jewish activities, such as this subs strong preference the word "zionists" and desperate attempts to avoid appearing racist.  If the opposition has no better recourse than to call them racist and ignore their claims, shouldn't you take it upon yourself to research their claims?

       These people are genuine, they just don't care what others think of themselves or this forum.  Call them selfish if you want, but they are hardly disingenuous.
