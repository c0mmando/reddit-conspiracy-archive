        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-02-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/O_BlackBetty.html">O_BlackBetty</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Interestingly enough, it seems the powers that be (the wealthies, in case you&#39;re not up to speed) are on about installing  women as our next world leaders, most likely in the hope that men will succumb to their quickly-being-built-into-their-psyches need for maternal guidance in lieu of a world view as enabled by having a man/father as the role model. </p>

<p>Principles as in the ones instilled in men for the past 40(+) years by making sure through the court systems that women are the heads of broken households: regardless of ability, mothers have become both parental role models which is unfortunate because women do not know how to be men <sup>1</sup> . </p>

<p>Of course you, wise and untainted reader, realize that women are followers by nature regardless how independent and ruggedly incisive they appear; it&#39;s unfortunate that the people who run this planet and plot and plan and have wheels within wheels constantly turning to achieve their ends, also know that women are not men and cannot imbue male children with what it takes to be a man. Proof of this is easily found at large in American society by contrasting present day males (any age to about 40 years old) to men who came before that &#39;cut-off&#39; point.</p>

<p>Followers are a good thing as far as the wealthies are concerned... it&#39;s how they get things done. </p>

<p>Ah... the days of Pharaoh are long gone! No more cracking of whips over the slaves to make wonderful things happen. </p>

<p>Well... okay, so not MUCH has changed... just the mindset from the slave&#39;s point of view as to what constitutes slavery.</p>

<p>Think of what women leaders, across the globe, will mean for the planet. </p>

<p>And while you&#39;re thinking about those ramifications, keep in mind that you should be worried.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like emplacing actors as heads of state - just not as obvious. </p>

<p>The middle east and all patriarchal societies, of course, will NOT soon be following the “trend” of installing women as their leaders, for obvious reasons, There is the distinct possibility, as backwards as some middle eastern cultures appear, they realize that women are too easily persuaded to follow and are usually, regardless of independent demeanor, easily manipulated. </p>

<p>Therein lay a bone of contention; old dogma running up against &quot;new and shiny&quot; dogma. </p>

<p>Ah,  the future... ... .. . Such a darkly exciting place!  .. ... . . ....  and considering how well planned it is, you&#39;d think there is no choice left but to fall for the machinations of the wealthies as their overall final scene draws closer and closer... closer with each passing month and year </p>

<p>Most of us, the peon class as viewed from the very tippy-top, are NOT going to make the cut and will, unfortunately, be shuffled off this mortal coil in short order (if you can find them, please feel free to read some of my earlier &#39;rants and insane suppositions&#39; – not that it matters but some of you may feel the need for background). </p>

<p>No no no! Don&#39;t start crying NOW. There&#39;s no point. You&#39;d only be shedding tears for hundreds of thousands of years of mankind slowly becoming followers and relying more and more on people to lead them... Not being responsible for one&#39;s own person is now an artform... one you can appreciate by merely looking around you (that is, if you&#39;re not stuck in the basement 24/7 hacking away on the idiot box (no-not TV... the computer is TV&#39;s replacement) making all your salient points to no one but the bit-bucket.</p>

<p>You really don&#39;t think all these expensive “free social sites” occurred by accident, do you? A way for you to be monitored that you EMBRACE... monitored by people who may or may not have your best interests in mind.</p>

<p>No... no use crying now. We, mankind, had our chance to &quot;make this world a better place&quot; and we didn&#39;t. Hell... most of us sold out. Bye bye soul... hello money! Hell of a deal.
...</p>

<p>Oh! And the global warming thing? Coming along nicely. Greenland&#39;s interior will be &quot;thawed&quot; and ready for use within some of your lifetimes... well, depending on how long you&#39;ll be living, of course. A utopia on an otherwise heavily tainted earth will be built on the new inland sea... a utopia that so small a percentage will see and use that it verily boggles the sensibilities as to how this is allowed to happened... in plain sight... under our noses...</p>

<p>All that special effects nonsense about Elysium and what it portends... as if the wealthies would blow that kind of money on being at constant risk (space IS hostile). There will be no “wealth exodus” to sky borne paradise... why would there be when paradise is right here on earth... for those with the money.</p>

<p>That the wealthies set up utopia on the beautiful inland Greenland sea for a fraction of the cost it would take to build even a small orbiting vehicle big enough to hold them.  There aren&#39;t many wealthies at all, in spite of what the &#39;visible&#39; money grubbers think about how fabulously rich and powerful they are... present day politicians, bankers, brokers, heads of business... all thinking they are the the ones running the planet while in fact it turns out that they are doing the bidding, like most of the world governments, at the behest of the wealthies who actually DO run the planet. Their money is a smoke screen, a crude joke, and won&#39;t keep them any safer than the rest of us when it comes time for the wealthies to assert their global dominion and for the bulk of us to &quot;die off and quit polluting THEIR world. You don&#39;t really think the heirs to this planet are going to allow the scheming, conniving, lying, and generally evil (depending on one&#39;s outlook, naturally) come into their new society, do you? Why would such a knowledgeable group, having invested centuries of planning and manipulation to shape mankind&#39;s “destiny”, trust the very mercenary scum they emplaced with a new society? Answer: the wealthies will not allow any of these possible troublemakers to &#39;stick around&#39;. </p>

<p>Think of how easy it would be for the wealthies to maintain their control from their new “fortress of solitude”... These people who now control the military in most countries, the economies of the world... Think of what happens when communications, travel, money... even the very job the peons are allowed to do, are controlled completely by the ruling class. All technology halted for the lesser castes (no more planes, trains, automobiles and boat rides for the peons who remain). </p>

<p>Space was a wonderful notion, and to be sure, the wealthies will keep enough &quot;technicians&quot; to be able to go there any time they want... for the thrill, you know. They have cars, the best food, the best entertainment (and the way to make more), servants for EVERY aspect of their lives, and complete control of the planet&#39;s population and resources. Completely justified in their eyes as THEY are the ones who got themselves to this position.</p>

<p>Sorry... I digress.</p>

<p>Maybe more later... maybe not.</p>

<p>Women to lead us... coming soon to a theater near you!</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> interesting note - you&#39;ll also notice the growing number of suicides among the American population with the military, specifically, tallying unheard of levels of self termination. This can be directly attributed to males being raised their whole lives by women as the head of house or head of family. As traditional &quot;man values&quot; are being replaced with the way women process thought, men, who are still required to be men, are being overwhelmed and lack the emotional/mental capability to treat incident as a man should (somewhat cold and uncaring, as I&#39;ve noticed). Hence, combat situations are now being &#39;handled&#39; by men (and I still can&#39;t believe this one - women) using mental processes unsuitable for coping.</p>

There are so many different threads crammed in here I don&#39;t know where to start but if you think women are the problem after 2000 years of patriarchal aggression fucking up the planet I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll even bother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where have I said women are the problem?</p>

<p>No, I&#39;ve explained what&#39;s getting to happen, and why, and even some of the circumstances that will allow such things to happen.</p>

<p>Misogynistic? Nope. Looking at an &quot;end run&quot; play coming to fruition? Yep. Does it scare me that so many people will be &quot;sacrificed for the bottom line&quot;? Not so much.</p>

<p>The thing that bothers me most is that we, as a race of people, were doomed because A) we had no plan and B) the next &quot;superior&quot; batch that showed up would have no problem handily removing us just as we overcame neanderthal man.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only recently become apparent that evolution IS still working, though unfortunately, sometimes it&#39;s not a &#39;natural&#39; occurrence but is caused to happen by people making it happen.</p>

<p>Cryptic? You bet big money, you win. Do I intend to clear it up and spell it out to you and all the others? Nope. Wouldn&#39;t do a bit of good.</p>

<p>good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hates women... wow.</p>

<p>No, I really don&#39;t think you have a grasp on what&#39;s been said, and that&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t really expect you to. Or anyone, for that matter. It&#39;s the nature of the indoctrination you&#39;ve received all your life and as I am well aware, it&#39;s a very pervasive and encompassing (complete?) fabrication your in. Kind of like the matrix... except there&#39;s no neo coming to save the day.</p>

<p>No. I don&#39;t hate women. I&#39;ve simply pointed out some of the truth behind what&#39;s happening, and in previous posts have even explained some of &quot;why&quot;.... </p>

<p>Good luck. I expected no less from folks who, like you, respond to this post by completely missing the point.</p>

<p>And, your entire footnote at the bottom.</p>

<p>All of that comes with a denotation that women are inherently inferior when it comes to physical stress (combat situations) and leadership roles. </p>

<p>As i said in my previous comment, i completely disagree with your divisions of genders concerning these attributes, although, when neutering your main points of address, i can essentially say that i agree. </p>

<p>But thanks for the supposition of ignorance and misconception. That i may have embellished the degree of effeminate dissonance your prose represents may be true. But it carries a parallel tune nonetheless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of that is an attack on women. It&#39;s history. It&#39;s fact. It&#39;s what&#39;s happening as we speak. Regardless that it &quot;looks like something else&quot;, everything I&#39;ve pointed out is accurate.</p>

<p>It sounds as if you are more capable of making an idea you don&#39;t like into something not socially acceptable rather than facing the truth and coming to grips with reality. I think that&#39;s an Ostrich&#39;s response, also.</p>

<p>You&#39;re ability to deal with relevance rather than the pablum you&#39;re spoon fed and constantly bombarded with is typical of modern mindset. I don&#39;t blame you as you have nothing to go by but what you&#39;re told, and what you&#39;ve been told is a lie. When someone comes along and tries to relay factual information that falls outside what you&#39;ve been told to accept as reality you attack it by putting it in some category that demeans the information and makes it easier for you to disregard completely... much akin to sticking your fingers in your ears and shouting about &quot;conspiracy nuts&quot; in order to drown out factual information.</p>

<p>You have a very typical outlook and mindset... not unique at all. Exactly as you&#39;ve been programmed. There&#39;s really nothing more to say because I&#39;ve handed you reality and all you&#39;ve done is squinch up your eyes and shout all the louder.</p>

<p>Good luck. </p>

<p>Remember, when you hear the warning sirens and you decide to ignore them, it&#39;s too late to seek shelter when the tornado scoops you up, regardless of the sudden realization that what that siren was saying was true and how you should have listened.</p>

<p>imo, people don&#39;t realize, Hillary ain&#39;t all she&#39;s &#39;sposed to be, everyone has a dark side &amp; being a woman myself, i&#39;m sorry to say i don&#39;t trust her as far i can throw her, that being said, Elizabeth can&#39;t be trusted either. any &quot;good&quot; woman in power has been <em>taken out</em>, gender is no safety net.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Very good let the idea of conspiracy fill your veins. But remember child.... when all are gone and we reduce society down to just the 3. The Father. The Son. And The Holy Spirit (Woman).  It is the Holy Spirit that must create new sons and new fathers. And When the time has come for her to create no more (because she&#39;s being abused and creating the sons that see the father as too callous or as too evil) she will appear in power that no MAN can attain. She will control the mechanism which no MAN has the ability to - Time and Life. </p>

<p>See while MAN has great tricks, woman has the power. She will teach the baby boy the language that he will use to communicate with the people. She will teach the baby boy the nature of life, of hunger, of sustenance. She will teach him how to do evil to ensure survival. She will teach him how to love and how to care for the family. You see the ancient Greek myth of Oedipus or the theory of Jung are one in the same.</p>

<p>Man evolves to the quintessential woman of wisdom, Sophia - so as to guide a woman to her ideal self.  And Woman will evolve to the quintessential man of knowledge of good and evil - Hermes - so as to guide man to his ideal self. The Anima and Animus. Daddys little girl, and Mommas boy. </p>

<p>A woman leader - Queen Elizabeth, Margaret Thatcher, Annise Parker, Golda Mier - they appear when the men have grown weak and apathetic. The men need to be guided to find themselves by seeing an altogether physically weaker being, appear mentally tough.  When the women must be elevated in a society - men will lead inspirationally. And when the change begins to occur, men will lead more as lessons and warnings that we discourage in the coming age. </p>

<p>A woman of power can simply believe the world into being around her. She possesses immense power. To control life. No energy weapon. No top secret spying apparatus. No hidden poisons. Or HAARP. Or CERN. None of these can control her. They will exhaust her as the boys cloud her mind with things unreal. But ultimately the boys can&#39;t be the dog. It is only Ghia that is life.  </p>

<p>The world of Avatar or of the Matix or even Alien makes a very clear statement.  The female is the most important character in the story, often she&#39;s Sigourney Weaver.  Making a girl tell people how to spell Sigourney all her life will make you pretty well suited for these kind of unique woman roles.  In Avatar she is the patron spy of the tree of life (the Kabbala). In Alien she is slayer of the evil of the hunting captive. She is the slayer of a nest of over producing animals.  She is the keeper and lover of the robots.  And in the Matrix, she is the reason for which Neo finds strength to take on a false reality.  She is the guide for man to find himself.</p>

<p>But before we get all revolutionary lets look at the truth of these tales.  Avatar ends with the tree that they lived in destroyed, but the tree of souls still in tact. Its an apocalypse metaphor. Its a revolutionary type of programming. Sure you will die, but your soul it will still be there. Its fine. And if you don&#39;t believe in that, well then you could imagine you are all Avatars. It&#39;s fine.  You&#39;re going to die. Its alright. See heres some 3D stories that SEEM SO REAL THAT CAME FROM SOMEONES MIND. The idea is not that far fetched! BELIEVE THE APOCOLYPSE OF MANS OWN DESTRUCTION WILL KILL YOU, but not take your true self. In fact its quite insidious. The INCEPTION idea of traversing an infinite regress of realities of perception. Dreams within dreams within dreams within dreams... Ultimately they had to simply rebuild the shit and no tree was rebuilding itself to the size that it did for thousands of years. They were granted one person, a half breed with knowledge of the metal sphere and love for the life force, for one ginormous fucking tree. And a big mess to clean up. For what, man to realize that he could not destroy the will of LIFE. And to return to his metal hole with proof that dragons and their keepers are stronger than floating helicopters and missiles.  You can garuntee that the one half breed - disabled in the mans world but empowered in the womans - is eventually going to start the cycle of manhood all over again.  And he has the knowledge to assert his dominance. But when his tough woman says jump... hes going to say how hi. When she says kill that man. Hes gonna kill him. When she says enslave that species,  hes going to enslave that species. Woman has power. </p>

<p>How about the Matrix. What did we learn there. We learned that the matrix was probably a way better place to live. Live in the matrix where you had infinite power over your world....  Or make everyone live in a shithole &quot;New Zion&quot; without the illusion of being free. Trinity is placed in this tale in very much the same way Noah&#39;s wife is in the Kabbala.  The apocalypse serves as an educational tool of the Tinity or the Oracle (both females).  All I know is ultimately life in Zion is going to be pure survival and pain.  They are going to be a slave to wanting to exist in that world. And add babies to the mix, and food... they are a slave to survival.  Most wont survive without sunlight.  And quite frankly it just looked like it smelled heavily of body odor.  No thanks. Still slaves. To feeding and reproducing with women. Woman has power. Ill take the matrix.</p>

<p>And Aliens and Predator, are both the same kind of tale only this is a bit more dark of a statement. Here we got a bunch of ravenous hungry animals that only know how to reproduce because of a woman or queen figure that fucking loves children like an queen ant loves ants.  And well the woman of prudence and wisdom is like, no maam not in my house, you dont get my daughter, and you do not get my spaceship. You thoughtless bitch. I will light you up with the technology of the world that you have so thoughtfully decided to use as your foundation for existence. Well smart woman wins there.  In Alien vs Predator.... again a woman of learning off on the edges... while man kind gets themselves in between an advanced hunter race and an advanced reproducer race.  Advanced hunter race destroys advanced reproducer race with mankind dying in full both as hosts to the aliens and as non hosts. The only survivor is a black woman.  Just as the black woman thinks all is lost, more hidden hunters decloak from the shadows and collect the fallen and present her with a piece of their advanced technology.  And a hybrid predtoralien busts loose and now she gets to be the advanced Huntress species in the hunt for the advanced hyper reproducing predator alien species.  </p>

<p>At that point we are situated with the counter example. Woman as guides of the topology alone, stand no chance against the hunters that mass reproduce. It is this society that woman, to exist, must eventually succumb to a chest buster with a biologically superior component. Since her chest buster will necessarily have to be hunter/alien/woman mix - her offspring is inherently going to be a bit more diverse and prone to survival than the dual mix made of the spawn of three dead soldiers.  The game will play out in such a way that the hybrid survivor technology hunter reproducer alien will enslave and or defeat the hybrid dead soldier species.  And when the predators come again they are going to have quite the cluster fuck on their hands, which they will simply nuke and say fuck it don&#39;t give that black woman a spear anymore. But likely one hybrid predator alien woman is going to ultimately fall in love with some sort of weaker hunter and use that as a basis for siphoning out their tech.  And then the next time the hunters come. They will be captured and enslaved.  Such is the great cycle of genetic competition. All the while, the black woman is going to be in every being of power there is.  Woman inherently enslaves man once again - by genetics.</p>

<p>The moral of the story guys, is woman always has the power so it dont really matter who has the power on paper or in belief. Woman has power in your genes. </p>

<p>EXTRA CREDIT:  Explain how The Hunger Games is the same story again. Explain how Lord of the Rings is the same story again.  Explain how Inception is the same story again. Over and over ad nausium. All the while we have all this programming for mankind to reproduce ad infinitum... we got a big fucking problem with population.... Maybe, just maybe, we need to attack the paradigm from homosexuality as a means to naturally occur and equilibrium state of life on this planet instead of a mass reproduce until whoops fucked that up lets plague it or war it back down to size.</p>

<p>Having luxury in this world is vain at best. It&#39;s not something to aspire for or be jealous about. We are the creation of a just God and justice will be served accordingly. Loving your fellow man and loving God is what&#39;s important.</p>
