<p>How can I get a dialogue going with my; 
&quot;wife&quot;/&quot;parents&quot;/&quot;best friend&quot;/&quot;etc.&quot; about </p>

<p>...not just conspiracies, but anything that relies on the prerequisite of letting go of their confirmational bias(es) and empowers them to assess factual evidence to reach their own conclusion.</p>

<p>The first and often hardest step is to have the evidence itself, actually available; so I took it a step further by compiling the proper accompaniments via documents, news articles, catalogued FOIA requests etc.  This way, you can approach any of the topics from the audio/video productions, or through the correlating documentation.  </p>

<p>I am also converting many of the articles/books/news reports into text-to-speech files.  This is something that I have been learning and perfecting over the last few years.  I can take any  .doc/.pdf/.txt/rtf/html/jpg/.epub/etc. file and have it properly collated, formatted, and converted to an audio file that is comprised of the best sounding TTS voice (Neospeech Bridgette) that incorporates the dozens of tweaks and tricks I&#39;ve learned; along with the option of having the actual text file scroll through the screen as its being read to you.</p>

<p>I love having this available because it opens up the availability to be discerning, digesting and analyzing information when reading a book or having to look at any text whatsoever just isn&#39;t an option.  I&#39;ve been able to absolutely tear through volumes of information and sects of data that wouldn&#39;t be fathomable if stacks of books and PDF printouts were my only option.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;ll end the rambling for now and have a post with more details a little later this evening.</p>
