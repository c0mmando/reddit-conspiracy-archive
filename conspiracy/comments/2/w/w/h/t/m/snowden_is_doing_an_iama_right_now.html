       Agreed.  The whole limited-hangout theory makes no sense to me.  The NSA thrives in darkness, why would they feel the need for a "limited hangout" in the first place?

       They wouldn't, though I doubted him myself as it pays to question these things, then I read this:
       <br/>
       <em>
        The Kaspersky report on the "Equation Group" (they appear to have stopped short of naming them specifically as NSA, although authorship is clear) was significant, but I think more significant is the recent report on the joint UK-UK hacking of Gemalto, a Dutch company that produces critical infrastructure used around the world, including here at home.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Why? Well, although firmware exploitation is nasty, it's at least theoretically reparable: tools could plausibly be created to detect the bad firmware hashes and re-flash good ones. This isn't the same for SIMs, which are flashed at the factory and never touched again. When the NSA and GCHQ compromised the security of potentially billions of phones (3g/4g encryption relies on the shared secret resident on the sim)[1] , they not only screwed the manufacturer, they screwed all of us, because the only way to address the security compromise is to recall and replace every SIM sold by Gemalto.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Our governments - particular the security branches - should never be weighing the equities in an intelligence gathering operation such that a temporary benefit to surveillance regarding a few key targets is seen as more desireable than protecting the communications of a global system (and this goes double when we are more reliant on communications and technology for our economy productivity than our adversaries).

       <br/>
       -Edward Snowden, supposed limited hangout.

       To me this reads like potential misinformation, it implies that the reason for the NSA's blatantly illegal "intelligence gathering" was to spy on "a few key targets" and that the rest of us were just unfortunately grouped into that because the NSA can't weigh its priorities and was
       <strong>
        really serious
       </strong>
       about tracking those "few key targets", rather than what seems clear to me which is that the goal was always maximum surveillance and storage of all public communications.

       Well yeah but the difference is he seems to be saying that the dragnet surveillance was an
       <em>
        unintended consequence
       </em>
       of the NSA originally only trying to go after "key targets" and catching the rest of us in their net, so to speak, whereas to me it seems clear that the NSA has always been working towards total surveillance from its inception - meaning the dragnet wasn't the consequence but was the goal.  Sort of a subtle difference, but a very important one.

       What do you mean?  You have it right there in the quote, he specifically says that the purpose of the "intelligence gathering operation" was for the "temporary benefit to surveillance regarding a few key targets".  It's right there in plain English.  My position is that this statement is bullshit, that these "key targets" don't and have never existed, and that the goal of the NSA has always been to spy on all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you actually believe that the NSA compromised thousands, millions, billions of SIM cards in order to go after a "few key targets"?  Or that the two decisions the NSA was weighing were, "Do we fuck over millions to capture these 'few key targets' or do we instead decide to protect the global system of freedom and privacy"?  Do you actually think that was what they were deliberating over?

       This was never in question, by me or anybody else with eyes to see. George has been endlessly accusing Snowden of being a limited hangout for a long time and my point was that that doesn't look like it's the case. Greenwald however, not so sure, he's the one holding back info.

       Fair enough and I don't claim to know for sure one way or the other but there is more than enough for me to remain suspicious as of right now and not nearly enough for me to claim he and his leaks aren't part of a larger psy-op.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that's the case, who is or isn't "in on it" is a matter of speculation but yes I agree with you that it seems pretty weird that 95% of the documents have still not come out almost 2 years later - and to me it's equally weird that Snowden doesn't seem to care that the information he sacrificed his life for won't reach the public in full for another 20-40 years at this rate.

       I agree it's weird but it was supposedly his suggestion that it was done this way to protect agents in the field etc. He seems pretty on-the-level from what I've just read and I really don't see how his statements in that AMA benefitted the CIA at all, straight-up libertarianism in my view.

       Yeah agreed, he had some interesting answers in the AMA for sure.  I'm curious what he'd have had to say about the agonizingly slow release though, whether he thinks it's justified or fair for the public to sit around for decades, continuing to be spied on with impunity and with increasingly advanced tech, waiting for Greenwald to publish the documents while he (Snowden) grows old in some foreign country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, I remain on the fence but lean slightly toward LH if I had to say one way or the other.  Bear in mind that Snowden himself
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       still be legit in that case.

       Exactly, he may be an unwitting pawn still but I don't think he went the way they'd hoped if that's the case. He's arguing for more citizen control over all aspects of Govt. I tip my hat to him for that.

       Do they?  Or do they perhaps equally thrive on fear and self-censorship?  What's the point of playing God if nobody knows you exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       The other aspect of this is that they could be over-playing their capabilities in the leaks, making people think they're near omniscient, that nothing and no one is safe from their prying eyes, and thus bringing about a "chilling effect", when really their surveillance is actually less widespread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Snowden's leaks could just be revealing the very base level of what's happening and what's been happening, whereas the reality (which he isn't revealing) is far worse.  This is typically how "limited hangouts" are used.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most suspicious thing to me is that now, almost 2 years later, ~95% of the documents or more are still yet to be released.  The effect of this slow release, besides being suspicious as hell to me, is that people lose interest over time, the surveillance continues just as it was, and it all becomes normalized.

       Snowden has nothing to do with the publishing of documents/information.  He released 100% of his documents already.  It's now up to the journalists to publish the documents he provided.

       Do you remember Greenwald's "big leak" that was canceled at the absolute last minute (the one that was supposed to name names) amid "new government information" and then was never mentioned again?  What new information needed to be vetted?  How did it affect the content of the article?  Why is the USG involved in any way with the dissemination of the leaks?  How did they contact Greenwald?  Why was the article never released at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       All questions that remain unanswered as far as I know.

       Or, 4. As Greenwald stated on the AMA:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We've been reporting continuously on huge stories without pause for 18 months, using editors, reporters, and experts from all over the world.
These documents are complex and take time to process, understand, and research.
If we rush the reporting and make mistakes, we'll be doing a huge favor to proponents of mass surveillance, and then people like you will be coming and asking - reasonably: "why did you rush all this? Why didn't you make sure the reporting was accurate before publishing it"?
Snowden expressly asked us to vet the documents carefully and subject them to the reporting process so that the public could be informed in a clear and accurate way. With an archive this vast and complicated, that takes time.
I hardly think anyone can complain that there hasn't been enough reporting done - it's been an unprecedentedly continuous and rapid stream of stories. The public needs time to understand and digest them, and good reporting takes time to do.

       Yeah that's always been his response to anyone questioning the incredibly slow release.  But if the documents are source documents, why would reporting accuracy come into play at all?  We could all read the documents ourselves and come to our own conclusions.  The documents are what matter, not Greenwald's summaries of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I can even understand wanting to vet them properly, fine, but 20-40 years for all of the documents to reach the public (closer to 40 at this rate)?  That doesn't raise even an inkling of suspicion for you?  If not, then we won't see eye to eye here because it does for me.

       I'm sure the documents that will be released will be released before then. Unless you know something we don't? It's also about finding the man power to trove through all these documents to make sure that there is no information contained within them that could some how harm an innocent party, not to mention any legal ramifications that newspapers and broadcast corporations might be liable for, and they also have to redact names (plus who knows what sort of information is contained within the leaks, we don't have all the information, so that hampers us right from the outset). I mean, how many people are employed to check these documents in particular? How many journalists are even willing to touch this stuff?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, if you had the documents, maybe you would speed this process up, but like it or not, it is up to Greenwald and co to decide the best and safest way to disseminate any information they might have, because they are the ones who have it. The fact that they might not be handling this information the way others might, including yourself, doesn't automatically mean there is something untoward about all of this.

       No, I just meant that around 5%, possible a lot less than that, has been released almost 2 years in so it'll be 20-40 years before we have them all at that rate.

       Agreed, I don't know either way, I just stay open (and viligant with regards) to the possibility that there is something more going on - maybe I'm too much of a pessimist, time will tell and for what it's worth I hope my suspicions are unfounded.

       Cool, well I'll continue believing that there is a good reason why only 5 percent of the leaks have been released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, I don't even think the rest of the 95 percent will even be that shocking, just more of the same really. Even though they insist there is some big revelations to come, I can't help but feel that as journalists, they are milking this a bit, giving that the spotlight is on Greenwald, part of him must be enjoying all this attention, could be another reason why he doesn't want to "blow his load" to quick, for egotistical reasons.

       <strong>
        Evidently, four years inside the national security bureaucracy radically changed Snowden's views about executive secrecy. "I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong," Snowden said after releasing dozens of classified documents to two newspapers. Snowden says he got "hardened" later in 2009 as he "watched as Obama advanced the very policies that I thought would be reined in." He now believes the government's spying programs pose "an existential threat to democracy."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Snowden says he concluded that "you can't wait around for someone else to act. I had been looking for leaders, but I realized that leadership is about being the first to act."
