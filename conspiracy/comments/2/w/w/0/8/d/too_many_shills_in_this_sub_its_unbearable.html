<p>Edit: ITT - shills giving us the incorrect definition of shill (correcting our own thoughts for us) </p>

<p>Seriously, count how many accounts replied &quot;shill means someone that doesn&#39;t agree with you hurrr durrr.&quot; These people have the same handbooks, retorts, and lines of replies. Hell, the top (vote brigaded) reply is a shill reply encouraging shills for arguments sake. Neglecting the fact that is there status quo - to disrupt the deeper investigation of topics using baiting and sidetracking. </p>

<p>Anyway. I don&#39;t give a shit you&#39;re a shill, I understand you need some of that sweet sweet money to pay bills, family, ect but it&#39;s annoying that&#39;s your job. </p>

<p>What exactly did I say besides my own point of view that got you worked up? The first two points were my own opinion, as I thought was clear. I should have stipulated that this is just from my own personal view as a user that spends too much time here, and considering that there is no way to know exactly who is &quot;shilling&quot; you and I both know there is no way to provide an accurate source on this. </p>

<p>Could you please provide a source as to why you think that there are shills here since you told me I was wrong that there are few real shills here (As I defined them)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they have a point of view worth listening to</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is again a failure on your end to completely understand what I was saying. Everyone has a point some are stronger than others. What I want to see users on this sub do is let a person say their point and then politely debate it. If what you are saying is factual and clear then you should be able to refute a point not silence a user with the threat of &quot;shill&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop with the false equivalency. We know that shills exist, and they aren&#39;t just &quot;people with dissenting opinions.&quot; How fucking dumb do you think we are?</p>

<p>Pump those brakes home slice and chill the fuck out. Do you think Im a shill? All Im doing is calling for users to be level headed when dealing with dissenting opinions. My point still stands the best way to handle a shill is clearly with good information. If shills exist you wont be changing their minds right? So change the minds of the people who visit this sub by engaging in dialogue, and not tossing out insults or being derogatory, it makes you look ignorant. </p>

<p>The message I am getting from you is &quot;Shills are not a problem if you speak logically to them.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, maybe - but it depends on how you define &quot;problem.&quot; I&#39;m not just talking about winning internet arguments here (seriously who really cares?) The essence of misinformation is to muddy that waters and detract from real conversation.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t your above message be a similar message that someone who is paid to spread misinformation would try to disseminate?</p>

<p>Which is why I support clear concise arguments so that this doesnt happen. So we dont have to fall back on emotional responses which muddy the waters. Shill are going to be posting here whether you like it or not, I wish they didnt exist but the reality they could very well be posting here and I encourage users to remain level headed. </p>

<p>For example if a user was writing something I disagreed with I might make a slight along the lines of &quot;Your comments are nothing but half-assed one liners&quot; or &quot;you dont belong here&quot; it almost immediately discredits that person as being small minded and unable to clearly say what they mean, or at least a lack of intelligence. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s that we disagree on the best way to deal with a problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not emotional, after talking with you for the past hour+, I&#39;m sharing my candid opinion.

<p>By abiding by the rules, you can call out shill-like behavior (usually with links to history), because the word carries <em>weight here</em>.</p>

<p>If anything, Rule 10 has strengthened this sub, as it is rare for an argument to devolve into name-calling and generally shillery. The responses are more powerful and the shills (who most surely exist) are rendered less effective, compared to the other subreddits.</p>

<p>Take nothing personal. Stay on topic. Address valid arguments, debunk false arguments, ignore when they become abusive, agressive and insulting (sometimes, when they overdo it, a short, snarky, witty response is enough to make them stop - TRP AMOG style). Lead the discussion. Why? Because it is not about you, nor the shill regurgitating the &quot;debunkers 101&quot; factoids and distortions, it&#39;s about the guy/gal lurking, reading, coming for the entertainment value and staying for the information, who might, at some point during your argument, have a sudden realization or feel compelled to do h[is|er] own research. </p>

You point out the idiocy of their statement, they make some comment in return just rephrasing basically the same bullshit, you post something like &quot;or just repeat the same thing and ignore the facts, that&#39;s another option&quot;.

<p>I don&#39;t even bother commenting on posts anymore because of the amount of shilling and vote rigging.</p>

<p>How do you define &quot;shill&quot;? Does everyone who disagrees with you count? What about people who are part of organizations that you don&#39;t like who say you&#39;re wrong? I find myself arguing with people who wave their arms are Freemasonry because I&#39;m a Freemason and I know how wrong they are... does that make me a shill? If so, is that a useful definition of shill?</p>

<p>My definition is this: someone who, regardless of what they may know or believe, is supporting a position for ideological reasons or reasons of personal benefit.</p>

<p>For example, if someone works for Congress and edits Wikipedia to make their boss look good because their boss told them to, then that&#39;s a shill.</p>

<p>But if someone works for Congress and edits Wikipedia to make their boss look good because they honestly believe what they are writing, then I don&#39;t call them a shill. I might question their bias, but that&#39;s another matter entirely.</p>

<p>The definition of a shill is someone who advocates for/or against a particular cause, yet pretends to be a disinterested third party, versus someone who has been tasked with or has an agenda.  </p>

<p>It is in their advocacy for or against a particular narrative that shills will always be easy to spot.  They refuse to give ground no matter how many citations you provide.  When they fail to refute your points they pretend like you never made them.  They deflect, they derail, they deride.  When all that fails they resort to ad hominem and logical fallacies.  Also, they typically like to get the last word, no matter how long the comment train goes or who has presented their side more successfully.</p>

<p>You can see these &quot;disinterested third parties&quot; all over Reddit, in partically every popular sub.  Advocacy is fine.  Pretending you are an average Redditor instead of someone with talking points and and an agenda makes you a shill.</p>

<p>As an example, in <a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a> I maintain the flair:  StandWithRand.  I openly advocate for Senator Paul as our next President.  Were I a member of his campaign I would say it proudly, because the truth fears no investigation.  Now, if I went into <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and put up the flair Team Obama, then spent all my time detracting from Team Obama, that would make me a shill against Team Obama.  When I go into <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> I announce I am a libertarian so people know what to expect.    </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories, by their very nature, are going to lack citations because they are, after all, theories.  Those posting the theories do not actually have access to the information that would corroborate their theories (ie.: internal government documents).  If they did, they would no longer be theories (i.e.: it is no longer a conspiracy theory to suggest the government can/does track everything you do on the internet...thanks to Edward Snowden no one can be made fun of or thought to be insane when they suggest that idea).</p>

<p>In my experience many of the folks who post here do so in such a manner as to debunk government lies and obfuscation, versus saying hey, this is how it all happened.</p>

<p>This is untrue. If I want to posit a vast web of US Government conspiracy to implement total surveillance, I can cite mountains of evidence. You don&#39;t have to accept that there&#39;s any conspiracy. You might maintain that it&#39;s all singular action, but the volume and insistence of the attempts to implement such a system in the US makes such an assertion difficult to defend.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some random examples:</p>

<p>The theory of gravity is a theory. We have a tremendous amount of evidence for it.</p>

<p>Now, if someone wants to say, &quot;well, I have no evidence that aliens are controlling politician&#39;s minds, but I want to discuss how likely that might be,&quot; I have zero problem with that. Even when it comes to the things I care about. Want to talk about how Freemasonry <em>could be</em> an evil plot to establish Deism as a state religion? Let&#39;s go! I&#39;ll happily discuss the possibility as a purely logical conjecture. But if you claim that you know this to be true, then I&#39;m going to demand that you support your claim with something more than a YouTube video of a guy charging $20/head to spin tales of &quot;when I was a Freemason I learned all the real secrets!&quot; You&#39;re going to need compelling evidence.</p>

<p>The government would not be acknowledging these programs without the Snowden leak.  Now we have admission from the horse&#39;s mouth, so to speak, and that is far more definitive than piecing together the narrative of a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Trolls do it for the lulz.  Shills do it because they are paid, or it is otherwise in their professional interests to do so.  When they fail to disclose those interests and pretend to be something else, they have become shills.  Kind of like the difference between a slut and a whore.</p>

<p>Of course this is true to some extent, but I think you and I both know that it&#39;s a spectrum. There is citation which is at least better than nothing and there is citation which is arguably worse than nothing.</p>

<p>If you present the latter and numerous people refuse to accept it, then that doesn&#39;t make them shills. Again, <em>I&#39;m drawing a line between quality argument and poor argument.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Online shills certainly exist, we have seen enough leaked official documents over the last few years to know that that is the case. And yes, they probably infiltrate Reddit, it&#39;s worth it for them alongside Facebook and Twitter, given that Reddit is considered the front page of the internet.</p>

<p>But where I would draw the line is whether they frequent this subReddit in particular, I don&#39;t think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (or any of the subReddits included on the sidebar) really have that much of a real world impact that they even need to bother. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take heart.  Even if you don&#39;t get upvoted and reach the top, a few will read your comments.  If you have good ideas or information, people will pick it up and repeat it.  </p>

<p>Think of it like starting a fire.  The shills will try to put it out, but if you start the fire in enough places, one of them will take off and be repeated.  It just takes a bit longer for information or ideas to propagate.</p>

<p>Also, here are a few things I&#39;ve learned:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some get paid by the number and length of reposes you give them, so they&#39;ll simply state the obvious opposite of what you&#39;re saying or twist the logic.  If you get responses like that, you&#39;re best bet is to keep your response short and highlight the twisted logic.</p></li>
<li><p>One tactic I&#39;ve seen is that if you are posting to something current, they will distract you by responding to a comment made over a day ago.  Don&#39;t bite, simply ignore it.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a thick skin and remember that you&#39;re not posting with your real name.  It&#39;s just a login name, so it&#39;s not like you&#39;ve got to defend your character.  It&#39;s O.K. to be wrong or say something stupid.  Just try to do better next time and move on.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s preaching to the preaching to the choir, so nit picking his post is kind of inappropriate.  After all, this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  If he made the rant on say <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> or <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, the level of support needed would warrant your response.  But then again, he should be tailoring his post based on the audience, and to support his position elsewhere would require more detail.</p>

<p>Based on your post, I would start wondering why you&#39;re here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> picking someone&#39;s post apart.  This is a sub for discussing and hashing out alternative theories, not for supporting every little detail.  It is assumed that if you&#39;re here, you already subscribe to some conspiratorial views that are outside of the norm, so you should be much more tolerant.  If not, regulars will assume you&#39;re either a shill or troll from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, that is great advice.   Second, you can get paid for the # and length of responses you get?  I did not know that.  How do you sign up for that?</p>

<p>Finally I  would add, if you know about something, speak your mind.  If you dont know about the topic, STFU, google it,  and learn before you speak. So as to at least give the appearence of intelligence, that is if you dont like being called a dumbass, under any name. </p>

<p>If you are a troll by nature, what can I say, you are who you are. Most people are smart enough to figure that out and dont give a shit what you have to say anyway. Imo trolls often provide much needed comic relief for ones who have knowledge of and take the topics seriously.  </p>

<p>At least for me.  I know stupidity shouldnt be entertaining, but it elimanates many of head ache to see it as that, instead of trying to educate the ones who dont want to or cant learn.</p>

<p>There should be a <a href="/r/specialneeds">/r/specialneeds</a> to send troll users to until they are capable of having adult conversation.</p>

<p>Reading the comments on some posts nowadays is like reading shill handbooks and beginner&#39;s guides. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  When you read through the comments you will certainly see a decent bit of legit discussion, disagreement, and healthy (or sometimes not, but not shilling) debate.  HOWEVER at least 1/2 of the comments, especially on controversial topics or topics that other subs are interested in (Monsanto anyone?  or how about 9/11 etc.) are from people who if they are not shilling, are certainly performing the same service as shills but are perhaps not being paid.  They dont post here except for those specific topics, they are never open to discussion, they strictly support the status quo, and repeat the same thing over and over.  They contribute nothing to the conversation or the debate. </p>

<p>A LOT of people in this thread and other similar threads always say &quot;you just think anyone who disagrees with X theory is a shill!&quot;  Well first of all that is a strawman, but w/e it does happen now and again.  HOWEVER, it is rarely the case, shills and people similar to shills (discussed above) are relatively easy to spot vs. just someone who happens to disagree with you (again for reasons above) and do show up quite often.  Is there some overlap?  Sure, but no where near the extent that some people make it out to be.</p>

<p>To sum up, yes this place is flooded with shills, as long as money is speech and call center-style agencies are a dime a dozen this will continue to be the case.  This place is also flooded with shill-wannabies that love supporting the status quo on their own free time, and that will also be the case as long as the current power structure remains in place.   Get used to it, do not engage them, read their manuals and have constructive discussions with those who have a more open mind!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you decide who is and isnt a shill?</p>

<p>I post about 9/11 and everyone agrees with me since i have taken physics and what happened in real life does NOT agree with science.</p>

<p>I post about global warming and i get called a shill by TONS of people. Yet, once again, I am just posting factually correct science.</p>

<p>So, in 1 case I am a real conspiracy theorist, and in the other case I am a shill. So which one is it???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you care? Does it really matter what exactly they think say or do in here? Almost everyone in here I am sure looks thru downvoted comments and such to see what is really said.</p>

<p>Your need for votes in this sub is not needed we can look thru and see what is said. The consistant bitching about them and name calling when its not the case has got to be the saddest thing ever.</p>

<p>A shill is someone paid to change the narrative or steer the direction of a conversation. This sub isn&#39;t taken seriously anymore because of posts like yours. They make us a community look pathetic and weak. Don&#39;t pay them any mind man. Fuck acceptance and say what you thing needs to be said long as you don&#39;t break the reddit or sub rules. </p>

<p>Now you get a comment taken down then find a new way to say it and repost if its worth it. Too many in here wanna call anyone that won&#39;t agree with them a shill cause its accepted in here and that is stupid.</p>

<p>Fight with your brain and logic not your emotions. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even bother commenting on posts anymore because of the amount of shilling and vote rigging. Reading the comments on some posts nowadays is like reading shill handbooks and beginner&#39;s guides. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got lots of data and aren&#39;t at all relying on anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>(Massive generalisations ahead)</p>

<p>In my experience the existence of what you&#39;re calling &quot;shilling&quot; and &quot;vote rigging&quot; is accepted as staight-up fact around here, and rarely with anything to support it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not even getting close to the general habit of labelling anyone who disagrees or questions as a &quot;shill&quot;. There are plenty of users who seem to be able to do little else.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually hilarious how prevalent the sense of persecution around here is sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False. Accusing users if being shills is. </p>

<p>By abiding by the rules, you can call out shill-like behavior (usually with links to history), because the word carries <em>weight here</em>.</p>

<p>If anything, Rule 10 has strengthened this sub, as it is rare for an argument to devolve into name-calling and generally shillery. The responses are more powerful and the shills (who most surely exist) are rendered less effective, compared to the other subreddits.</p>
