<p>We all broadly agree about 9/11, what more do we need to be upset about? September 11th is still the keystone that holds everything up. I think even this subreddit has become a provider of distractions, we seek out more conspiracies to investigate, to keep our mind away from the known horrors. </p>

<p>The conspiracy community is goaded into violence all the time by all sides. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/terror-threat-homeland-security/">Haven&#39;t heard of the recent DHS warnings?</a> And if they aren&#39;t successful, they will use provocateurs to instigate the necessary violence themselves. This confrontation is inevitable, </p>

<p>Since the 1980s crime has gone down in the United States, but the number of <a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/18/john-oliver/segment-ferguson-john-oliver-says-swat-raids-are-1/">SWAT raids has increased by 1400% since then.</a> Reflect on that for a moment. Are the <em>American people</em> being goaded into violence -- or just the &#39;conspiratards&#39;?</p>

<p>Are you aware of the events in Ferguson, Missouri? That was sort of a test run or a model for other future domestic operations. Similar but more sophisticated versions of this model have been used in the past, like in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">Operation Gladio.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the Ferguson crisis seemed engineered, to an extent. There are hundreds of cases of blatant police misconduct and the ones that blow up in the media are, importantly, extremely divisive. When there are a thousand cases of power abuse that everyone could get together and agree on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thought is that an act of violence in a large group of people is a catalyzing action, but it can go either way. One nutjob taking out an innocent teacher because they read an article on a conspiracy website that made them insane with anger (which is an all-too-easily obtainable emotional condition for humans), well that can be the beginning of a publicly supported campaign to shut down alt-news websites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, its really going to be up to the divine and people&#39;s intuition. I dont think violence helps, it creates patterns of abuse that can some times not be undone. I think Gandhi was best and handling this. YOu can stand up to violence, but not act out of violence yourself.
You cannot allow yourself to be controlled by emotions, work at it. Meditate, read books on controlling and silencing your mind. The less we react from emotions, the better of we will be. because its all a game anyway this reality is a simulation, were here to learn how to be better human beings and everything that happens to us is a reflection of that.</p>

<p>When you are responding to a post with a statement about how they don&#39;t make sense... then that&#39;s a good sign that you are attracted to them. You can&#39;t say anything that they would find interesting in response. And you can&#39;t let them alone in their confusing commentary.
