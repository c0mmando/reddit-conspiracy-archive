       I'm not going to jump to any conclusions, but a couple of these recent scandals are light on the evidence and heavy on the emotion.

       We all broadly agree about 9/11, what more do we need to be upset about? September 11th is still the keystone that holds everything up. I think even this subreddit has become a provider of distractions, we seek out more conspiracies to investigate, to keep our mind away from the known horrors.

       Maybe you're not aware of this but the logic in your statement amounts to something like this: Why go out and seek new, scary and interesting experiences? Stay with what you know to be familiar and safe.

       The conspiracy community is goaded into violence all the time by all sides.

        Haven't heard of the recent DHS warnings?

       And if they aren't successful, they will use provocateurs to instigate the necessary violence themselves. This confrontation is inevitable,

       Since the 1980s crime has gone down in the United States, but the number of
       <a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/18/john-oliver/segment-ferguson-john-oliver-says-swat-raids-are-1/">
        SWAT raids has increased by 1400% since then.

       Reflect on that for a moment. Are the

       Are you aware of the events in Ferguson, Missouri? That was sort of a test run or a model for other future domestic operations. Similar but more sophisticated versions of this model have been used in the past, like in

       I agree that the Ferguson crisis seemed engineered, to an extent. There are hundreds of cases of blatant police misconduct and the ones that blow up in the media are, importantly, extremely divisive. When there are a thousand cases of power abuse that everyone could get together and agree on.

       This is true, they need us to be perceived as threats so they can take action, Just dont fall victim to it and stay peaceful but firm in your conviections in all situations, work at doing that in small things and you can do it much eaiser in big things.

       My thought is that an act of violence in a large group of people is a catalyzing action, but it can go either way. One nutjob taking out an innocent teacher because they read an article on a conspiracy website that made them insane with anger (which is an all-too-easily obtainable emotional condition for humans), well that can be the beginning of a publicly supported campaign to shut down alt-news websites.

       This is true, its really going to be up to the divine and people's intuition. I dont think violence helps, it creates patterns of abuse that can some times not be undone. I think Gandhi was best and handling this. YOu can stand up to violence, but not act out of violence yourself.
You cannot allow yourself to be controlled by emotions, work at it. Meditate, read books on controlling and silencing your mind. The less we react from emotions, the better of we will be. because its all a game anyway this reality is a simulation, were here to learn how to be better human beings and everything that happens to us is a reflection of that.

       I don't agree with you, most of the simulation theory advocates I run into use it to excuse hedonism and nihilism. It doesn't matter, it changes nothing, even if it's true.

       I already answered your question on if it changes things, it changes everything the more you look at what reality really is. Im sorry you don't see that. If you confine yourself to only this reality you will miss the important stuff.

       Gandhi only succeeded because of the implicit threat of violence, that would be unleashed if he had failed to accomplish independence through non-violence. The British were scared, not compassionate.

       No, Gandhi succeeded because he showed the world that what the British was doing is wrong. Thats the whole point of non-violent resistance. Its to make people reflect on themselves. Most people can not live with them selves if they knowingly allow others to suffer and some people cant operate with bad intentions when the world is watching.

       Myth. Power. Value.  When you got people believing in evil of each others choices, then you don't got people believing in the evil of our environment especially when ignorance and failure to look at the data slowly lead us to the role of necessary evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution?  Find a way that what you are reading isn't evil. But is in fact either misinterpreted or not fully understood. Always see the good in the world, and you will only be surrounded by what is good.

       You should recognize evil, but justify it with a greater good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately you should always reduce to the following structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hunger is evil, but necessary so we can have cute little babies and be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until
      </p>
      <p>
       Babies are evil, but necessary so I wont be hungry when im old and cant buy my own food.
      </p>
      <p>
       However you see that little tit for tat of life - is what is the ultimate truth to your world. Is life good. Or is it evil.

       I find it disconcerting that you use the words "evil" and "greater good" in the same sentence without being forthcoming about your Machiavellian predisposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is not about good, or evil. The world is both good
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       evil. It is a Baphomet, and to master such a creature you need balance. I would argue that our world is out of balance and tipped in the favor of evil -- for now.

       And while you argue, you project out disharmony. I do not argue. I simply state that the two are there until ultimately the overarching experience is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is indifferent to morality.  It is human behavior that is good or evil. And I believe that good will always be the collective goal of all life.

       I don't have the key to your cipher so I'll throw you one in return: Lucifer is the most beautiful angel of light, but his symbol is the Moon, and his light is a reflection of the Sun. Oh and "Cosmic Love is absolutelely Ruthless and Highly Indifferent: it teaches its lessons whether you like/dislike them or not."

       Cosmic Love is a long journey. For to understand love at the cosmic level, you must understand a time frame that is several billion orders of magnitude longer than the one our mortal coil is confined.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you do have the key to the cipher. Lucifer can shine the light but only a wee bit using kindling or gallium arsenide and electricity. Its not enough light to illuminate the moon though. And its not enough light to heat it up to sustain life.  But the SON. The SON is the light. And the SON's light gives life to the entire solar system. The SON illuminates cosmic darkness which is COSMIC LOVE.

       But I do not look mad. And, more importantly, I do not feel mad. And, most importantly I do not act mad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the only communication that took place between me and you has been visually exchanged, and you said that I "sound" mad which means you perceived the information through hearing - it must mean you are projecting audio onto visual information that is angry. Try to read it in a hopeful, or at peace voice.

       Its like the perspective i portray is the sum of the identities i have encountered in my life.  And since I encounter and remember only beautiful souls, the perspective I portray is always going to be beautiful and good.

       When you are responding to a post with a statement about how they don't make sense... then that's a good sign that you are attracted to them. You can't say anything that they would find interesting in response. And you can't let them alone in their confusing commentary.  You are compelled to say nothing to them, by judging their words confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Realize, you and I, are part of the same mind. And any point you encounter someone where all you can think to say is how they are unclear.....  that means you really just want to kiss them. And thats what you should do.

       No, Gandhi succeeded because he showed the world that what the British was doing is wrong. Thats the whole point of non-violent resistance. Its to make people reflect on themselves. Most people can not live with them selves if they knowingly allow others to suffer and some people cant operate with bad intentions when the world is watching.
