         15-02-02: Ukrainian army shells Donetsk again, finally hits the factory where rebels fix their vehicles and tanks. This is 50 meters from the week ago bombing of the bus stop. That week all Ukrainian MSM and world MSM talked about how it was the rebels who shot themselves and their city. But now that a strategic location is hit... it's probably the rebels again right? It couldn't be that Ukraine was trying to hit this factory last time too...

          Documentary of the guy who filmed the night shelling of Luhansk.
         </strong>
         The Ukrainian channels say that the separatists shot their own city. And the host even jokes that "again, the Russian humanitarian aid canned food exploded". At 2:40 he shows unseen part of video. You can see the GRAD firing onto Luhansk. The rockets took 46 seconds to hit. He calculates the rockets fire a little bit slower than the rocket itself. You hear the sound 1 second before the shells flies over you. 46 seconds x 330meters/s = 15km away. At 9:52 he calculates the distance on a map. Figures out it was from "Makarov" village which the entire area is under Ukrainian control.

        Interesting tidbit. The shelling nearly stopped - or maybe I just haven't seen the videos, but after DNR/LNR went on the offensive, Ukraine stopped shelling cities.

       How dare these "terrorists" defend their homes from a tyrannical government?

       If the armed seperatist movement insists that the city of atrlanta now belongs to them, occupies military bases, and holds "elections" to gain legitimacy... sorry, it is an open move then.
      </p>
      <p>
       And surprisingly, if I look towards my understanding, I am pro russian here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, consider this:
      </p>
      <p>
       I would absolutely accept that the ukraine becomes a fully fledged NATO member, if in turn the US agrees to have cuba become a russian protectorate and allows russia to store all their atomic bombs there, pointed at various US cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because yea, it is too often forgotten that the ukraine is basically only 300 miles from moskow. You can not say, well, the russians need not to worry about shit, it's not like we want to station troops there just because now it's a member opf NATO, if you do not in turn allow for things like "russian troops on cuba", or such.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my honest feeling is:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the pro-russian minority really believes it's their right to seperate from the ukraine as its own country, shucks, who am I to argue with that? Fuck, arguing against that would be arguing against the will of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they then turn around, and go, "well, now people are not ok with us becoming the pro russian government, people actually want us to return to the ukraine, and they kind of answer every shot we fire with atillery fire", then fuck, what did you exopect to happen? What did you honestly think would happen, would everybody just quietly accept what you did? That they had no other choice?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, it seems stupid, callous and plain old mean to fire on civillians, but the people of that republic or wossname of donezk took that as an opportunity of choice, when they voited to seccede.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not want to live in an active war zone, which is something I absolutely support, you know where the russian seperatists are, thank them for turning your area into a warzone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you can't eat your cake and have it too, and you can't declare seperation from your state and then bitch about when some people expect you to actually defend your territory.

       see, the problem is slightly, that washington, and the whole of the US, has been doing this around the world, and we did not say shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, yes, we need to fight overseas wars. Oh yes, we need to liberate this and that, oh yes, it was neccesary military intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       The price of this is, you can no longer point fingers and say this was exceptional, don't do it, because the reply will allways be, USA did it first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back a group of military rebels to overthrow the government? 
cause insurrection? fire at civillians? Carpetbomb said civillians? destroy the local economy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck it.
      </p>
      <p>
       USA did it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just so you understand the feeling in moskow right now, imagine for the last few yeears, people have shat on the US. Called them weak, pussies, whores, hookers of the world, That their brand of democracy comes with a corporate sponsorship, and that you can not trust anything they say, because they are amerifat. The last wars they won were 1945, and only because they waited till the last possible moment to intervene, and went in gloy hounding.
      </p>
      <p>
       That mirrors roughly what you hear about russia, the russian bear that lost its teeth, since the fall of the soviet union, it is powerless, it is harmless, all bark no bite.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the next step would be to imagine a coaklition of china and russia sponsoring the occupy wallstreet, and the black lives matter movements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally, flying them out to fancy dinners, sending money, weapons, training....
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, everybody would scream, but that is fucking insane, can't you see, the russkies and the chinamen are doing this to hurt the US, they plan to overthrow us, domestic terrorists!
      </p>
      <p>
       And everybody else would go, but, don't you think black lives matter? Don't you think wallstreet is out of controll? why are you fearing this, this is the will of the people, we are only helping it along.
      </p>
      <p>
       and you get the same damn reports, how at the last oxccupy wallstreet protests, the russian embassador joked with the chinese one that the american pigdogs will never see this coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaders of the protest movement were basically sponsoired, schooled and bought by peking and moscow. When cornered, both go, well, we have a deep tradition of social activism, and a tradition of putting workers rights in font of corporate rights, it is only logical that you as a protestor or a country would choose the superior alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anbd then, the worst case. 
You suddenly have reports that a soviet backed group of revolutionaries won the elections in mexico, and you realize, that this time, american corporations are out of the deal. Mexico has already been quartered, sized up, and all the contracts went to soviet and chinese companies. Not a single one for an american company left.

      <p>
       And suddenly, america realizeds that at that very momnt, chinese and russian troops are 300 miles away from the boarder.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the world is laughing at their otrage. What are you afraid of, it's only a humanitarian operation, after all, the states of the communist league are only existant because of the cold war, but now adays, it's just business. Wellcome to the communist revolution 2.0 , comrade, oh and by the way, this is reaöly silly, bvut if we catch any secret agent missions in mexico, or more of your boarder hopping agents, we will see this as a direct act of military agression, and immediatelly retalliate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, a very small group of mexico goes, nope, we don't want to, we want to belong to the us. In fact, we are the United states of america, no longer mexico, and poof, they break off. And they start fighting with the soviet troops, their backs near the boarder. and scream over the boarder, help us, we dont want to learn russian, we are ethnically american. USA, USA....
      </p>
      <p>
       Woul the americans sit this out? 
Fume helplessly, and go, you are right, we didn't get it on paper that soviet backed troops may not be stationed near the boarder of america?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would it funnel mexican nationals that hopped over the boarder into the military, train them, and then send them back, because in truth, it does not care anything about tht fucking small strip of land near guardalahara, it just likes the idea of these people fighting their wars?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would the american people remain silent?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect, because this is hypothetical, most of the americans, like most of the russians, would be like, "kk, if they want to be soviet, let them, I am cool with that", especially since the US is so incredibly diverse and big, just like russia. 
But the hardliners, the "Patriots", the "Militiamen", would look at the situation, and go, wait a mi8nute, they think we are weak? Lets show them that we aren't!!! Turn mexico into a glass crater if they go! USA, USA, USA....
      </p>
      <p>
       The very same is happening right now with the conflict in the ukraine. You have ome legitimate interests of the civillians ( actually be themselves, governed by themselves, perhaps with a hopefull eye towards russia), that are legit. 
You had the rumors that the US was heavily involcved in the maidan riots, that the infamous snipers were hired by us interests to allow the revlutionaries the possibility to gain international support.
      </p>
      <p>
       you have the US looming like a shadow over the ukraine, stretching out its corporate hands. Sure, it is true that most us citizens will notr see a dime of the wealth they would gain from the military and private contracts overseas, but hell, it leads directly back to the us.
      </p>
      <p>
       a ftting carricature would be a troop of children, near the knees of the kindergarden teacher. 
The us baby, incredbly fat and with sunglasses, surrouned by the NATO babies, goes, "Ma'am, Ma'am, we all planned to steal just one cookie from the cookie jar, but then russia came and stole the cookie jar. Punish him!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then we have a russia, on the other side of the cookie jar, a baby in diapers that is essentially a bit too buff and grown up, but shirtless and boarderline gay, going, "They don't even like these cookies, they just wated some so I could have none. "
      </p>
      <p>
       And the kindergarden teacher holds the coopkie jar, which has "ukraine" written on it.

       I have no doubt against that. I understand your feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me if this roughly hits the nail on the spot:
      </p>
      <p>
       You are cuba in the 1960 havanna missle crisis. 
you do honestly not know if you should learn english, keep your own language, or start learning russian.
      </p>
      <p>
       "the west" plays the rule of the UDSSR, and obama plays crustchov(spelling unclear, he is worse then cummerbaux. ). It seems it has the fingers in many pots, and bort all those pots look so untasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putins russia is playuing the role of america, with putin as a 1960 version of a slightly more homosexual john F kennedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody talks about this and that and intervention, and support, but most likely, the people of the ukraine would be the happist if they coul solve their problems on their own. But on the other hand, like the 1960 cubans, you are unsure if you should piss one side off.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, that whole hullaballoo about d-town ( donetzk, excuse my spelling), as seen from a distance, seems to be the prelude to the cuban miussle crisis, the bay of pigs invasion. of course, russia, just like the us back then does not send its own troops, rather it sends people from there it trained, fed, cultured, and armed, asnd in some cases even salaried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me if this rings true.

       where is there any truth in this ? there is not even proof. One of these videos ive seen posted earlier somewhere else as russians shelling the same place. exact same video. dont accept anything as proof where there is none. As stated earlier though im not saying this stuff didnt happen. i just want people to see that you dont have to be on either side in this conflict as both sides are bullshit

       "This side is wrong, so the other side is right." is a logical fallacy. No one is right in this Conflict both commit atrocities in this war. As its the case in most wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also their is no proof in any of these videos other then people on a video on the internet saying that this is indeed what happened. Posted on Pro-Seperatist(Pro-Russian) accounts no less. Im not saying its not what happened just these are not good sources. Like i wouldnt trust a Ukranian account about what the russians did to them. You people say you are looking for the truth but still you take it easy on the truth when its good for your point of view. Still im not saying none of it happened.

       I didn't said it was military. Military refused to fight its own people until late May. They even was escorted by neo-Nazy "commissars" on their way to Donbass. You can find videos taken in May where regular troops are commanded by black uniformed Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the Western Ukrainian Nazi and CIA-backed crooks in the captured Parliament. You can find a video broadcast from Rada that day, Feb 23, 2014, whan they canceled so called "language laws". They was also suggesting to strip Russians from citizenship and was proposing many similar ideas. They just won a coup so they were full of ideas and happy. Deputies for non-Nazi parties was escorted by people with baseball bats or were absent, their voting cards were stolen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simultaneously there were ongoing standoff between Russians Orthodox Christians and Nazi mobs bused to Lavra in Kiev and Pochaev.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simultaneously they destroyed several Russian monuments all over Western Ukraine in just 2 days. I heard loud noises when someone was trying to damage Victory Monument in Lvov with my own ears. Some time before that, many street shops was sprayed with labels like "SBU owned" or "Kike owned" or similar, just like before Kristallnacht in Germany in 1938. I seen people attacked on the streets. This was like a declaration of war on Russians by the Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Please find TSN or Channel 5 broadcast from the Rada on Feb 22 and 23, 2014. Its all there.

       It's the Feb 23 that is most important. On Feb 21 Yanukovich signed agreement with the Maidan that there will be peaceful transition of power. Westerners agreed to be guarantors, Polack guy in particular. Then for some reason the same day he fled. It would be funny to find out someday if Putin told him to do so. On Feb 22 Deputes of the Rada received direct instructions from US ambassador, his statement probably still can be goggled. He ordered them to summon and start working. So the Feb 23 was important day. It was Sunday, I turned on one of the Nazi's TV channels although they gives me nausea and seen it all. To summarize their message to the people, they said exactly what Svoboda's witch Farion was saying for years - Russians, pack your suitcases and leave to Muscovia.

       Hey, I have another question for you. You keep referring to the Ukrainian leaders and their supporters as Nazis. Do you really think they are National Socialists?
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider them Fascists, but not really Nazis. Are you using the terms interchangeably, or are you referring to something else?

       Svoboda used to call itself some "Socialist National" party before. So they probably are National Socialists or just a mock up of it produced by the rich commie leader's sons wannabe fascists. Because that who they actually are, all of them. Timoshenko's party used to be just regular populists but when Maidan started they instantly changed to the extreme Nazi rhetoric. Timoshenko herself was discussing how she want to kill Russians with nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really it doesn't matter too much, after they trying to kill you for the first time, you really stop trying to distinguish them.

       So my next question then, is 'why?' Do you think this is more about population control, or baiting the Russian forces into a response for Western/Globalist propaganda? Or perhaps something else...

       Well, Russia probably started to consume too much of precious natural resources that it was suppose to dig from the ground and ship to the West for golden billion people's consumption. Things started to deteriorate fast about six month before the Maidan started and for the West it was excellent opportunity to reset Russia's state to the 25 years back. That's how this world works I guess.

       You could have linked to evidence supporting your positions, i.e. "The Ukrainians did
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       attack Russian populations 2 days into the conflict"
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead you offer nothing but unsourced claims. Why do you think
       <a href="/u/RusIvan9">

       "makes shit up and hopes people will believe him"? Can you provide some links for your claim?

      <p>
       Contribute to the discussion or I will dismiss your claim as unsourced and unfounded.

       Yeah, I know all your Nazi tricks, pal. Ukrainians likes to play with wording a lot. Like if Ukrainian Constitution protects Ukrainian people, will it cover the people of Ukraine? Apparently not, being citizens of Ukraine is not making Russians an Ukrainians. They are still subhumans and South-Eastern slaves to the fine Title Nation judging by what's going on in Donbass and elsewhere.
