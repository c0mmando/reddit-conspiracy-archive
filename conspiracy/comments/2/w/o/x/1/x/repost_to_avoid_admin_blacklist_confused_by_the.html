        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post has been removed twice. The first time I inquired as to why it was removed the mods explained that a link triggered the spam filter. The post didn&#39;t contain any spam or violate any rules so the mods reinstated it. </p>

<p>Minutes later it got removed <em>again</em> and it was explained to me that something is triggering an admin blacklist -- which overrides mod approval. My post contained a change.org petition, a Wordpress site, a Twitter page and several YouTube clips, and I was careful not to include personal information. Obviously an admin wouldn&#39;t blacklist popular and credible domains -- so they must be blacklisting specific URLs.</p>

<p><a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> suggested that I repost and include a note stating this post contained blacklisted information. In order to avoid the blacklist, I&#39;ve <del>removed</del> some of the URLs I suspect to be triggering it. Enjoy, the interviews are worth listening to. </p>

<p>And if you&#39;re completely new to this story, check out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2w4tdy/update_on_whistleblower_hampstead_uk_paedophile/">this thread</a>. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Here are interviews with Sabine McNeill, a German activist who is in contact with the mother of the children who came forward with allegations of extreme sexual abuse and ritual murder. She is the one who uploaded the videos, which in turn went &#39;viral&#39; (and are now being deleted by Google). Since then a warrant has been issued for her arrest in the UK, where she was living. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpan44oZlg8">Interview with Breaking Truth</a> [10:35, Skype, poor quality] </p>

<p>McNeill has initiated a change.org petition to bring attention to this issue, which can be found <del>here.</del></p>

<p>She also has a <del>Twitter page</del> which she updates regularly. She has set up a <del>Wordpress site</del> which is tracking this case. </p>

<p>McNeill has a legal team and she seems to be quite serious about pursuing this. It&#39;s important to remember that this case is real: the police investigation confirmed that these children had bruising and scarring in and around their genitalia, so severe sexual abuse has occurred. The question is why the police haven&#39;t launched a formal investigation into not only the mother and her partner, but their father, the school and the church where these incidents allegedly took place. </p>

<p>Anyway I hope this gives you all some context. </p>
