Why would they destroy Sandy Hook School before anyone could examine it, and then buy the alleged shooters house for $1.00 so nobody else could get it; and then destroy his things before anyone could examine those. Why has $27,000,000.00 been gifted to Sandy hook survivors and the City Of Sandy Hook; it had never happened before, though millions have also been gifted to the alleged Boston bombing victims since.</p>

<p>The fact no one seemed to care too much (no protests, no demands for actions/accountability, etc) means they are correct: either everyone is an idiot or no one cares enough to act.</p>

<p>Osama, even though he was never connected to 9/11 nor wanted by the FBI, was still one of the major reasons of the invasion and subsequent occupation of Afghanistan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s set aside for a moment whether or not it happened so we can answer your question. It&#39;s a practice that has a lot of history to it, a leader&#39;s body can carry with it a lot of power after death, probably the craziest example of this I can think of is the multiple kidnappings of Alexander the Great&#39;s body by his generals as they fought over who got what parts Alexander&#39;s empire. </p>

<p>Hitler was burned and thrown into a river, Gaius Marius&#39;s ashes and bones were thrown into a river by a rival, Christian martyrs&#39;s remains were often thrown into rivers as well. These are all acts to disperse the power surrounding these remains, a group being able to gather around relics of significance can lend a lot of power to their cause, bodies of waters have traditionally been a great way for the opposition to stop this from happening.</p>

<p>So in Osama&#39;s case, why would we do it? Well, what would you do with it? Bury it in an unmarked grave? Bury in a marked grave and guard it? The body wasn&#39;t going to be left at Osama&#39;s home right so the Navy Seals took it back to their closest base of operations, a ship. Once the body is on the ship you&#39;re going to do what with it? Like I said, bring it to America and bury it? Fly it back to Pakistan and bury it there? You&#39;re going to dump it in the ocean after gathering pictures and any samples from the corpse that you want. Did you want them to return it to America and hand it over to Dateline to perform an autopsy? </p>

<p>Those are the two reasons you&#39;d dump his body in the ocean, to counteract the power that his dead body could confer to his followers and conviennence; whether this happened is a different question.</p>

<p>But, to entertain you, why do you think there is any possibility of confusing the president of the united states and the leader of al-qaeda?</p>

<p>One lives in the white house, is african american, works as a president which is one of the most public jobs in the world and appears daily in the media.</p>

<p>Other is an arab terrorist leader who spent his last decade in hiding, dresses in traditional afghan garments with a long beard, appeared in media through pretaped videos.</p>

<p>Why would someone worry about mistaking the two?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t find &quot;any other mainstream sources&quot;, because I don&#39;t fucking care to look. It&#39;s not my theory to prove. The point was, you are under the impression that &quot;Usama&quot; was this strange new thing being put out just before the staged Abbottabad Raid. My point was it&#39;s not a new thing and it goes back to W&#39;s presidency. You&#39;re wrong. Flat out. What&#39;s worse is you didn&#39;t take the time to fact check your own theory before putting out bullshit conjecture then tried to turn it around as if your point wasn&#39;t that is was suddenly just used before the raid. Furthermore, the fact that you assumed I exclusively get my news from one source explains way more about you than it does about me. You don&#39;t know me, but have fun pretending you do. </p>

<p>P.S. I never claimed any other &quot;news&quot; channel made references to &quot;Usama&quot;. I just made the point that it predates Obama. Re-read comment thread if necessary. </p>

<p>Edit: Also, at the time I&#39;m referring to, Fox News was more commonplace than CNN, which before then was the go to channel during Desert Storm. </p>

<p>Stick to Fox, then, but don&#39;t get whiny when people accuse you of being a Foxnews fanboi.</p>

<p>If you can trouble yourself to expand your horizons, here are some WhiteHouse.gov references to &quot;Usama bin Laden&quot;.</p>

<p>They are contemporaneous with the 2011 Abbottabad raid. All prior references appear to be to &quot;Osama&quot;. Just sayin&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue isn&#39;t whether or not I&#39;m a Fox New fan, which I&#39;m the furthest thing from. As if you really fucking care. I don&#39;t trust any of them. They&#39;re mostly a lot of bullshit with some sprinkles of truth, which is besides the point. The issue is the fact that in your mind &quot;Usama&quot; became a thing just prior to the raid. All I said was it&#39;s not something that just became a thing as it was referenced quite often on Fox News- when I was a kid. That&#39;s it. I didn&#39;t care then, but I remember it being used and everyone parroting it as if Osama had released a statement to the world. After, I said that, you changed your tune to dismiss them as a news outlet. Seeing as Fox News took off as a major news channel after 9/11 and especially during the lead up to the Iraq War, I would say it was pretty common source for most Americans news, therefore it was a common form of spelling prior to Obama being nationally known. Which is before the goddamn raid. That&#39;s the point. You&#39;re a fool if you can&#39;t see that... or a Master Troll. Honestly, it&#39;s up in the air at this point. Either way, I&#39;m done. Have fun pretending you&#39;re right or superior in any way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is the spelling they used in &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot; because the case agents at the CIA who spoke Arabic believed this was the correct translation, not Osama. But generally it is like the difference between color and colour. They are both the same word yet spelled slightly different based on what culture is translating it.</p>
