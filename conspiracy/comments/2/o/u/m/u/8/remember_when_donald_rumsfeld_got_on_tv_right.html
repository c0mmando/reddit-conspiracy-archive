       Rumsfeld got on TV, right after 9/11 and the Anthrax Attacks, but before the DC Sniper?
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumsfeld – the Secretary of Defense – told us that we had been attacked by a world-wide secret terrorist group called “Al Qaeda.” “Al Qaeda” was headed by Usama Bin Laden, who was acknowledged to have worked for the US in the past – and that this formidable terrorist group “Al Qaeda” was headquartered in secret underground caves in Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumsfeld provided us this cartoon of the underground caves. Sure, it looks like something I would have drawn when I was about 10, playing GI Joe and Cobra Commander. This would have been Cobra Commander’s Underground Lair, I would have made it out of legos perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Tim Russert of CNN is sitting there and Donald Rumsfeld is showing us this cartoon – remember, most people actually thought there would be another set of buildings blowing up or that they would be getting anthrax letters – and Russert has this sort of critical look on his face.
       <strong>
        But Rumsfeld is being totally serious, he’s like, yep and there is more than one of these underground caves too!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://hipsterracist.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/binladenscave.gif">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At one point they even suggested going out and buying duct tape and plastic to cover your windows in case Al Qaeda hijacked crop-dusters, flew over the cities, and sprayed everyone with chemical weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republicans – went on TV and intoned this stuff quite seriously. To question any of this narrative was to be a “conspiracy theorist” and you had to take Donald Rumsfeld’s cartoon underground cave very, very seriously, otherwise you were “fringe.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually they interviewed some US soldiers in Afghanistan and asked them about Osama Bin Laden’s underground caves and Al Qaeda in general. He said, yeah, they found a cave, about 6 feet high and a few dozen feet deep, that the Al Qaedas had kept some supplies, some clothes and food and a few guns. But no multi-level fortified – with their own electricity! – sophisticated underground bunkers that Donald Rumsfeld had told us about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing about the internet – you can go back a few years. Go back a few years, say, to the 10th year anniversary of 9/11. Who was a cheesemaker? Who was writing bullshit? Who was peddling the same old shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go back to when ISIS was debuted. Who bought it, or pretended to buy it? Who wrote VERY VERY SERIOUS articles about the new Clash of Civilizations and how ISIL was … whatever, something bad? Who spent time attacking the “conspiracy theorists” – people that didn’t buy whatever latest Reality TV Show they were showing – and maintained they were more “serious” than others, and took the opportunity to distance themselves. Go back a few years, look at who attacked the critics, look at those who attempted to isolate and discredit those who called “bullshit!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Hindsight is 20/20 they say. I take a look at the leading lights of the WN blogosphere and some people don’t look so credible anymore now do they?

       Before I knew what was going on, I was already distrustful of this guy. He is a sociopath, a broken brained subhuman. Nothing he has done has been good for the world, he is simply a bully.

       If you're into this as much as you say, I won't even have to admonish you to watch the whole thing. I discovered it maybe 2 years ago, and I sat rapt from beginning to end.

       Manipulation has always been with us. 9/11 snapped it into focus.

       After 9/11 the manipulation became very "in your face".
