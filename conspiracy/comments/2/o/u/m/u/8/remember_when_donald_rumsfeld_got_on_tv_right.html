        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Rumsfeld got on TV, right after 9/11 and the Anthrax Attacks, but before the DC Sniper?</p>

<p>Rumsfeld – the Secretary of Defense – told us that we had been attacked by a world-wide secret terrorist group called “Al Qaeda.” “Al Qaeda” was headed by Usama Bin Laden, who was acknowledged to have worked for the US in the past – and that this formidable terrorist group “Al Qaeda” was headquartered in secret underground caves in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Rumsfeld provided us this cartoon of the underground caves. Sure, it looks like something I would have drawn when I was about 10, playing GI Joe and Cobra Commander. This would have been Cobra Commander’s Underground Lair, I would have made it out of legos perhaps.</p>

<p>So Tim Russert of CNN is sitting there and Donald Rumsfeld is showing us this cartoon – remember, most people actually thought there would be another set of buildings blowing up or that they would be getting anthrax letters – and Russert has this sort of critical look on his face. <strong>But Rumsfeld is being totally serious, he’s like, yep and there is more than one of these underground caves too!</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://hipsterracist.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/binladenscave.gif">https://hipsterracist.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/binladenscave.gif</a></p>

<p>At one point they even suggested going out and buying duct tape and plastic to cover your windows in case Al Qaeda hijacked crop-dusters, flew over the cities, and sprayed everyone with chemical weapons.</p>

<p>The Republicans – went on TV and intoned this stuff quite seriously. To question any of this narrative was to be a “conspiracy theorist” and you had to take Donald Rumsfeld’s cartoon underground cave very, very seriously, otherwise you were “fringe.”</p>

<p>Eventually they interviewed some US soldiers in Afghanistan and asked them about Osama Bin Laden’s underground caves and Al Qaeda in general. He said, yeah, they found a cave, about 6 feet high and a few dozen feet deep, that the Al Qaedas had kept some supplies, some clothes and food and a few guns. But no multi-level fortified – with their own electricity! – sophisticated underground bunkers that Donald Rumsfeld had told us about.</p>

<p>The best thing about the internet – you can go back a few years. Go back a few years, say, to the 10th year anniversary of 9/11. Who was a cheesemaker? Who was writing bullshit? Who was peddling the same old shit?</p>

<p>Go back to when ISIS was debuted. Who bought it, or pretended to buy it? Who wrote VERY VERY SERIOUS articles about the new Clash of Civilizations and how ISIL was … whatever, something bad? Who spent time attacking the “conspiracy theorists” – people that didn’t buy whatever latest Reality TV Show they were showing – and maintained they were more “serious” than others, and took the opportunity to distance themselves. Go back a few years, look at who attacked the critics, look at those who attempted to isolate and discredit those who called “bullshit!”</p>

<p>Hindsight is 20/20 they say. I take a look at the leading lights of the WN blogosphere and some people don’t look so credible anymore now do they?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re into this as much as you say, I won&#39;t even have to admonish you to watch the whole thing. I discovered it maybe 2 years ago, and I sat rapt from beginning to end. </p>

<p>Manipulation has always been with us. 9/11 snapped it into focus. </p>

<p>After 9/11 the manipulation became very &quot;in your face&quot;.</p>
