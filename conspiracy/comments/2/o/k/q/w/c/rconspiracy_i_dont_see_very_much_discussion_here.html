        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is my basic understanding of this issue. If I have of this history mixed up, please correct me and provide some links!</p>

<p>Lester and James Crown are the son and grandson, respectively, of General Dynamics billionaire Henry Crown.</p>

<p>Henry Crown was born in 1896 and died in 1990. After founding the Material Service Corporation, later merged with General Dynamics. By the 1960&#39;s, Henry Crown wielded massive control over General Dynamics</p>

<p>His son Lester Crown was born in 1925 and is still alive. Both Lester and his son James (b. 1953) have close connections and many appointments (board directorships, think tanks, philanthropy etc.) within the world of finance, military, and industry. A quick look at the ties institutions like J.P. Morgan Chase, General Dynamics, the Aspen Institute, the US State Department etc. will reveal many board directorships, close relations, etc.</p>

<p>Regarding Lester Crown:  </p>

<p>&quot;Among those who appeared or offered affidavits in his behalf: Three former Secretaries of State, two former Secretaries of Defense, and former Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce. Henry Kissinger praised Crown&#39;s &#39;&#39;extraordinary probity.&#39;&#39; Robert McNamara had &#39;&#39;every confidence in his integrity.&#39;&#39; David Packard, co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard Company and head of a Presidential commission that had just recommended sweeping changes in the organization of the Defense Department, vouched for his &#39;&#39;trustworthiness.&#39;&#39;&quot; (NY Times, &quot;The Ordeal of Lester Crown,&quot; 1986) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/magazine/the-ordeal-of-lester-crown.html">link</a></p>

<p>Also, a quick look at websites like <a href="http://www.usmep.us/international_board/Lester_Crown.php">this</a> will reveal many other connections to groups associated with military, State, and finance figures like Zbigniew Brzezinsk, Chuck Hagel, Brent Scowcroft, Paul Volcker, and James Wolfensohn, to name a few. Simply browse through the drop down bars.</p>

<p>Now, I suppose this isn&#39;t &quot;Old Money,&quot; in the sense of the old European families, the Church, etc. However, in regards to American History, this family has been around since the turn of the century and has formed many connections that merit some research. To go into them in depth would be a long task.</p>

<p>Anywaysâ€¦ THIS to me seems to me like a glimpse at real core of the American military-inustrial complex. This is a fairly old and powerful with much influence in banking and government. This is rooted in their deep position within the world of Chicago politics. </p>

<p>All I can say after my research is that these intersecting interests between the banks, the military, and the US government, requires the Crown&#39;s to be considered more closely. These are the barons of war and finance who will benefit from armed conflict no matter the enemy. Indeed, it is hard for one to suspect that their span of influence will not be used to actually encourage war.</p>
