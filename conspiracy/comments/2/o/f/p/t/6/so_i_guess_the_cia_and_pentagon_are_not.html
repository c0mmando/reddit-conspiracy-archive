    <div class="md"><p>What you are seeing is that they do not have control. Everyone wants control. Everyone does what they can to have control. There will always be a power struggle between any two parties. But it is like gravity in that it is not noticeable when the parties in question are small or have little control over each other. </p>

<p>Given the opportunity any man would make you his slave. Any man foolish enough to believe that isn&#39;t true would be a slave. Power normally flows in the direction of power. Meaning people with more means use those means to increase their means. It is in every citizens interest to stem the flow of power to the government, because when that power becomes too great it always leads to the same thing, and if you think revolutions are bloody and terrible look into the conditions that lead to the revolution.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people who recognize that pot is not the demon it was made out to be. The internet has allowed those voices to spread, and amplified them. That is why this racket is finally coming to an end. But it is not, as you seem to be insinuating, going out without a fight. There is still a lot of pressure to stifle the pot industry; such as banks refusing to do business with pot shops and DEA raids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The possibility to be able to control does not imply the desire to control. We do not know the U.S. Government&#39;s desire indeed they have said nothing positive or negative about their desire to control. If they have controlled, which I don&#39;t believe they have, why would they control the enactment of Marijuana? Have they truly given up control, performed a Hail Mary (that is an American football maneuver) (meaning have they done a seemingly crazy thing and permitted Marijuana (e.j. Control)), or are they (as I believe) actually a f*cking Democrasy. Not liars all along.</p>

<p>Was the Internet just a way to lose control, or was it in fact a U.S. Military technology given to the world? And what great human beings would give such a thing to the world? Why would they not stop Marijuana? No, my friend. You are right they do not have control, but &quot;Everyone wants control&quot; is not definitive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Control is an advantage in every situation. Anyone without a desire for control is a retard. The obvious limiting factors being if you can successfully gain control and how much it will cost you. It is not required for someone to tell you they want control for a reasonable person to know it to be true.</p>

<p>You may think that sometimes you would rather someone else take charge of a project so you don&#39;t have to worry about the details. This does not mean you don&#39;t want control, but rather that the control you are giving up is insignificant to the peace of mind you would gain; or you are dumb. </p>

<p>Desire for control is simply a human quality, given a minimum intelligence.</p>

<p>Also it is not the Government that wants control but the people who run the government. If you work for the DEA you will want the expansion of DEA powers because by extension you gain that power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That being one aspect, I agree with your prediction of the positive effect (others might see differently, we really can&#39;t know except scientifically/experimentally). There is another aspect why regulation is necessary. For example butane extraction (I&#39;ve been armchair researching) leaves butane polutants in the concentrate if it&#39;s not purged correctly and could cause health problems. Vaporizor pens are also risky because metals, plastics, etc. used in them are unregulated. Personally I think corporations should be the ones who are regulated and the natural people should be more free than they are.</p>
