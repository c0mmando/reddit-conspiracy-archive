<p>Yep. Only it&#39;s worse.</p>

<p>Your government is actually a military dictatorship (and has been for longer than you realize), which creates legal fictions of your self at birth, which it uses as collateral for loans to a private banking system, which creates the currency you and I use for daily transactions out of thin air, which it loans to your government (remember, your future taxable earnings are the collateral) <em>at interest</em>.</p>

<p>You cannot make this shit up, it&#39;s truly the best story I&#39;ve ever heard, even if it was fiction. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, the news is telling me that the government <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBLNohqquRk">tortured some folks</a>, which those that were paying attention knew anyway.</p>

<p>So what do you think this corporation known as the United States will do legislatively while we are distracted with the new <em>CIA is bad</em> narrative? Thank baby Jesus it&#39;s almost time for holiday popcorn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and we&#39;re still figuring out the depth of corruption.</p>

<p>The best I can figure is: In the late 1800s, the nation The United States of America was replaced by a corporation, THE UNITED STATES. &quot;Citizens&quot; are corporate property, by some trickery of your birth certificate and obscure legal language.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not a ton of info out there on this. Here&#39;s what I did find. If I were having a child, I would research this much more deeply.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Here&#39;s a short video speculating that CPS would take your child, but nothing conclusive: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmHHkDHU2eQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmHHkDHU2eQ</a></p></li>
<li><p>This narrative appears to be more positive -- they not only successfully refused to register their child, but they got a passport as well:

<p>Sort of. It formed a municipal corporation for the specific reasons if governing the 10 x 10 square of land authorized by the Constitution <strong>for</strong> United States almost 100 years prior.</p>

<p>But, if you read further, it goes into specific detail for the roles of the House and Senate of the <em>United States</em>, not the <em>United States of America</em>, and changed the rules a bit as far as elections go. Some say enough to have it be separate and distinct from the original governmental structure (take special note of how they are elected according to the DCOA). They also vacated the contracts and charters of Georgetown and Washington, which make no sense if they were forming the original, or organic, governmental body (which is noted as being a corporation, along with the ability to sue and be sued).</p>

<p>You have to start thinking - <em>what were these guys up to?</em> Changing the rules, much like the Constitution did 100 years earlier (ratification used to be unanimous under the Articles, now only 9/13 necessary? Hmmm...)</p>

<p>And then when see what happens in further legislation by this corporate body which was nearly identical to the Constitution <em>for</em> the United States this Constitution <em>of</em> the United States was them reinventing the wheel <strong>again</strong>, and look at the destruction it has wrought since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. I would guess that Child Protective Services would step in. (In my case, I was born at home, although my folks later got a birth certificate for me. Probably doesn&#39;t make a difference, but I dunno really.) Let&#39;s google around and try to find out.</p>

<p>Lemme check on that second question.</p>

<p>So what if you refuse to get a birth certificate or SSN for your child when they are born?</p>

<p>There&#39;s not a ton of info out there on this. Here&#39;s what I did find. If I were having a child, I would research this much more deeply.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Here&#39;s a short video speculating that CPS would take your child, but nothing conclusive: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmHHkDHU2eQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmHHkDHU2eQ</a></p></li>
<li><p>This narrative appears to be more positive -- they not only successfully refused to register their child, but they got a passport as well:

<p>Also, am I reading your link right that the Act of 1871 created Washington DC, so it could act as a base of operations for the corporate bankers to take over since the actual constitution would not apply within the geography of &quot;Washington DC&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sort of. It formed a municipal corporation for the specific reasons if governing the 10 x 10 square of land authorized by the Constitution <strong>for</strong> United States almost 100 years prior.</p>

<p>But, if you read further, it goes into specific detail for the roles of the House and Senate of the <em>United States</em>, not the <em>United States of America</em>, and changed the rules a bit as far as elections go. Some say enough to have it be separate and distinct from the original governmental structure (take special note of how they are elected according to the DCOA). They also vacated the contracts and charters of Georgetown and Washington, which make no sense if they were forming the original, or organic, governmental body (which is noted as being a corporation, along with the ability to sue and be sued).</p>

<p>You have to start thinking - <em>what were these guys up to?</em> Changing the rules, much like the Constitution did 100 years earlier (ratification used to be unanimous under the Articles, now only 9/13 necessary? Hmmm...)</p>

<p>And then when see what happens in further legislation by this corporate body which was nearly identical to the Constitution <em>for</em> the United States this Constitution <em>of</em> the United States was them reinventing the wheel <strong>again</strong>, and look at the destruction it has wrought since.</p>
