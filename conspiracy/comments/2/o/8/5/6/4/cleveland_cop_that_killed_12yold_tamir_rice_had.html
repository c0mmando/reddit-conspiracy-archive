       CLEVELAND, Ohio — The Cleveland police officer who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice had issues with handling guns during his brief tenure with a suburban police department.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Nov. 29, 2012 letter contained in Tim Loehmann's personnel file from the Independence Police Department says that during firearms qualification training he was "distracted" and "weepy."
      </p>
      <p>
       "He could not follow simple directions, could not communicate clear thoughts nor recollections, and his handgun performance was dismal," according to the letter written by Deputy Chief Jim Polak of the Independence police.
      </p>
      <p>
       The letter recommended that the department part ways with Loehmann, who went on to become a police officer with the Cleveland Division of Police.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I do not believe time, nor training, will be able to change or correct the deficiencies," Polak said.

       Has anybody seen the surveillance video released by the Cleveland PD? The toy gun looked real because the orange guard was removed and there are several instances of him pointing it at pedestrians.

       So if they thought he was a real threat why did they drive up within a few feet of him? If he really had a gun why didn't they keep some distance and try to engage him with words first?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those cops fucked up bad and there is no defending them on this one. Think about it, if that gun had been real they would have been both dead. If his gun had been real they drove right up to him and he could have shot both of them extremely easily.
They fucked up badly.

       Because of the way they parked, you can't see the kid getting shot. Thus, there is no way to know if he reached for it or if it was even visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I thought I was getting into a gunfight with a handgun,  I'm getting as close as possible to my target. You'd be surprised at how hard it is to make a chest shot at distances as short as 10 yds. (Go to your local pistol range and observe some time.) The only way I'm putting distance between himself and me is if I have a rifle or shotgun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, he pointed what appeared to be a real gun at innocent bystanders several times. That is when he put his life in jeopardy. The only reason we are hearing about this is that it suits the needs of TPTB.

       That's the thing. They DO have rifles and they still decided to disregard everything they were ever taught on handling openly armed individuals. In fact, driving up as close as you can is one of the dumbest things to do unless you want to get yourself killed. It is not standard practice to pull as close as you can to engage a possible threat. Especially one that hasn't presented itself to be an active threat i.e. firing indiscriminately or
       <del>
        purposely endangering
       </del>
       firing purposely to endanger the lives of others. Either way, it's still a very stupid thing to do even if he was an active threat. At that moment he was an inactive threat. They fucked up. Period. Regardless of the age of the suspect, regardless of whether it was a real gun, regardless of whether he reached for it, regardless of whether or not he was waving it around; their deliberate disregard for police procedures is why he's dead. Those officers were negligent in their duties and their negligence killed him. If he had been a 20 year old with a real gun doing the exact same thing; the officers still fucked up by unnecessarily putting their own lives at more risk, which is why they are supposed to stage at a safe distance while using
       <del>

       their vehicle as a barricade. That being said, you're absolutely right about it only getting attention now because it serves the present agenda.

       Yeah, the fact that he was just a dumb kid had nothing to do with all this bad publicity.

       i agree -- i always wondered why (and definitely
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       ) some people get hired as law enforcement, it's becoming clearer to me now.

       So if they thought he was a real threat why did they drive up within a few feet of him? If he really had a gun why didn't they keep some distance and try to engage him with words first?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those cops fucked up bad and there is no defending them on this one. Think about it, if that gun had been real they would have been both dead. If his gun had been real they drove right up to him and he could have shot both of them extremely easily.
They fucked up badly.
