        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is actually two questions but with the main point that there doesn&#39;t seem to be any place anywhere on the internet that focuses on either of these ideas. Sure there are many places that include them (which itself is a success, pathetically) but none that exclude everything else.</p>

<p>I feel like literally everything else is just fluff that detracts from what needs to be discussed, whether intentionally or not (and if it is, shouldn&#39;t really matter. that&#39;s just more fluff).</p>

<p>In regards of &quot;Actual causes&quot; there needs to be precise discussion regarding what actually causes the major global problematic events.</p>

<p>For example, there should be discussion on how Ukraine became how it is today. What was the political situation before the resignation of President Yanukovych? How have the people&#39;s voice (conflicting as they were, but data on majority opinions and their locations should be considered) influenced or been accommodated by the resulting events?</p>

<p>On the other hand, what is the true cause of Isreal&#39;s creation and how does it relate to international opinions of this nation today? Understanding how exactly the Ottoman empire fell and how the British handled the resulting mess (particularly in how they decided upon what would become of Palestine at the time) should be crucial context in getting a grasp of what is happening today; also all the events that happened in between.</p>

<p>This level of understanding should also be applied to Ukraine but regarding that history I am much more ignorant. But I don&#39;t see these things ever being discussed. This is enough of a post so maybe I will start another thread discussing what I mean about the lack of conversation regarding potentials for a positive future. But then again, to even begin to consider future potentials one must be completely aware of the present and to do that a complete context must be grasped which best comes from analyzing the chain of cause and events that arose from history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea these two places are where I go to see what people think of the world (also RT, specifically the crosstalk show. Also Al Jazeera. Maybe CBC. Google News World category is actually really good too for current events) There is too much of the fluff as I said in world politics and even here though?

    <div class="md"><p>So I got through the video finally...</p>

<p>What were the protestors that got sniped protesting? Does this matter?</p>

<p>How does sniping these people benefit the forces behind the snipers? I&#39;m betting it&#39;s just chaos so that no one notices the puppet government being made. So yea, fluff and irrelevant (other than the fact it&#39;s meant to create irrelevance, there&#39;s isn&#39;t any other insight to gain from this)</p>

<p>So the main protesters are literally led by a Neo-Nazi? What is the relevance? Sure everyone knows that the US used radicals in the area to establish a puppet government. That&#39;s just what they do. But how does this relate to what the ukranians what?!? That&#39;s the most important thing to consider yet no one discusses this...</p>

<p>So the new government manages to push for a Referendum which opposes their masters wishes. What does that mean for the situation in Ukrainian politics?</p>

<p>None of this answered my question of why there was instability before the US interfered. Also, I never asked for proof. We all know that the US wants geopolitical instability anywhere there is resources for them to steal, mainly Oil. Their only GOD is Gold Oil and Drugs right? No that&#39;s actually prejudice. We have to understand what is really going on.</p>

<p>To be able to see how a corrupt nation can become stable and good again we have to see how it got there in the first place. The US doesn&#39;t instigate, they are too dumb to do that. They only capitalize on any slight instability in the first place!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, get creative. can&#39;t you think of like a million different inventions for the specific problems?</p>

<p>For example, some sort of currency that doesn&#39;t involve any banks. Oh wait that exists it&#39;s called Bitcoin. Or another example if there some platform to instantaneously send information to each other and organize alternatives to all the things that give them power, oh wait that&#39;s called the internet. Specific platforms don&#39;t exist but maybe they do, but don&#39;t get popular because ther are backed by specific ideologies that not everyone can agree with. So mainly what&#39;s stopping us is division and difference in beliefs. Even the smartest people can&#39;t agree on ideologies...</p>

<p>Plus... let&#39;s say what you said happens. even if everyone suddenly became aware and knowledgeable how would that help? Sure there would be less consumption but the powers already have so much resources they don&#39;t need anymore to keep us suppressed (though they continue to pillage the world for more, presumably &quot;just in case&quot;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting you said that, had to look it up. But if I understand you correctly, then it&#39;s as if your implying that there is some sort of alternate system that once it gains traction (kind of like you said earlier rolling down the hill) then it&#39;s all good since eventually it will reach critical mass and over take the existing system</p>

<p>but I don&#39;t see any real alternative system (yet) I think it needs to be invented first</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That only begs the question of &quot;what now&quot;</p>

<p>People only seem to be obsessed with getting others to see the corruption that they see. But how would that really change things? I&#39;m not saying it won&#39;t but if you don&#39;t know how it will then that&#39;s really lacking in foresight isn&#39;t it</p>

<p>The train of thought that cauesd me to post this thread really started when I asked myself if I was to really convince my friends to see what I see (and some do, other&#39;s can easily be convinced since I&#39;m not dumb), then what if they ask me what now? Those that already see the truth often just become complete pesimists and get the mentality of &quot;if you can&#39;t beat em join em&quot; ...or if anything they just further their quest for understanding which is good.</p>

<p>I actually have ideas of a &quot;what now&quot; but was just wondering what others think.</p>

<p>On the other hand I don&#39;t like to believe that the only thing fueling those in power is greed. If it is that&#39;s really easy to fix but it probably isn&#39;t. The biggest societal problems are usually due to misunderstandings (aka prejudice)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to take action now focus on actions you CAN do.  Stop using the system.  Stop buying unnecessary things, (ie- new phones, gadgetry, etc).  Stop watching tv (except for useful shows like woodworking and soldering maybe).  Focus on learning about things that&#39;ll help you out in the long run.

    <div class="md"><p>After forming a community then what?</p>

<p>Your right but that sounds like a really slow inefficient process. There needs to be more awareness on a global scale. I fear at this rate the global police state will come much faster than any local community can form, and by that time it will be much too late...</p>

<p>Also obviously a person doesn&#39;t change the world alone. If anything they would need to lead the rest of the world. I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do, lead the world of reddit. But then again, isn&#39;t that what all red-pilled redditors are trying to do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That only begs the question of &quot;what now&quot;</p>

<p>People only seem to be obsessed with getting others to see the corruption that they see. But how would that really change things? I&#39;m not saying it won&#39;t but if you don&#39;t know how it will then that&#39;s really lacking in foresight isn&#39;t it</p>

<p>The train of thought that cauesd me to post this thread really started when I asked myself if I was to really convince my friends to see what I see (and some do, other&#39;s can easily be convinced since I&#39;m not dumb), then what if they ask me what now? Those that already see the truth often just become complete pesimists and get the mentality of &quot;if you can&#39;t beat em join em&quot; ...or if anything they just further their quest for understanding which is good.</p>

<p>I actually have ideas of a &quot;what now&quot; but was just wondering what others think.</p>

<p>On the other hand I don&#39;t like to believe that the only thing fueling those in power is greed. If it is that&#39;s really easy to fix but it probably isn&#39;t. The biggest societal problems are usually due to misunderstandings (aka prejudice)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people need to invent their own democratic process to circumvent the false democracy currently in place.</p>

<p>That can easily be done. Any polling and such where everyone can agree on what should and shouldn&#39;t be done. And courses of action for those things to happen if massive petitions or spamming calls to governors or the UN is not working. I think it&#39;s time I posted the other thread since everyone else is so fucking clueless</p>
