        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For many years now my quest is to understand reality. I sacrificed a convenient and happy (ignorant?) middle class life in Central Europe in order to explore, study and understand reality. I always had the feeling that something was entirely wrong with this world. Since i was in kindergarden i had this feeling and that is what will always drive me to explore and understand more.</p>

<p>I grew up with the internet and it still is the focal point of my existence. I always was and still am interested of as many opinions and viewpoints of reality as possible. The internet made this possible and created a platform where everyone could talk his/her mind. I like philosophies, theories and even conspiracies for the reasons that drives and inspires them. I don&#39; really care if a view is right or wrong, i mainly want to draw a picture of reality by understanding the whole of humanity.</p>

<p>I come now to a point where i get more and more convinced that the world is actually something like what we would define as &quot;hell&quot;. Or to say it more accurate, until humanity forced its way out of the ruthless animal kingdom of survival we all lived in hell.</p>

<p>Hell is by definition endless suffering. So isn&#39;t it true that survival was exactly that? Always afraid, either too hot or too cold. Either starving or getting eaten by another lifeform. Consumed by fear and survival.
What if we escaped this scenario with what the bible calls the fall or eating from the tree of knowledge (and i don&#39;t want to become religious, but i see everything - like religion or philosophy - just as important as anything else and symptoms of it) from this hell?</p>

<p>We humans just started to become conscious about 40k years ago with the emergence of cave drawings in Asia and Europe. Isn&#39;t the unconscious mind nothing but a sarcophagus of automated reactions and behaviour which the soul has to endure? The body could easily be described as a prison for our soul which only purpose is to survive as long as possible. And what happens if your body dies? Your soul just wanders into the next body to suffer the next life, like the Buddhists tell us. We also started to use the environment and technology in order to reduce suffering (clothing, shoes, tools, fire etc.).</p>

<p>You might now claim that this world is not black and white, not only dark and evil. I don&#39;t deny that there are also good things in this world, but did you notice that those positive things are only created by something from within and ourselves? The only love we receive is the love we create. The only love we receive is from other people. Yes, we started to domesticate animals and they give us love too, but this was almost exclusively after our collective quest out of primal hell.</p>

<p>We lived in pure primal hell, we created hope and discovered positivity and love through it. We started to cultivate those positive traits, we started to work together and develop tools in order to create a social hierarchy and culture, and to defend our loved ones. We developed language communication of increasing complexity in order to nourish our social structures and culture. Language enables us to work more effective together against the evils and the dangers of this world. Technology and communication is what literally transcended humanity out of the animal kingdom of endless survival.</p>

<p>The wealthy western world still is with one foot in hell. Wars, inequality, populations of depressed and miserable people, the guilt of living on the cost of others. Because lets face it, the western world is only wealthy because we have gradual slaves around the world that do most our work and who enable us to live like this - India, China or Africa. Not to mention the wars we fight for energy ressources in the Middle East and the (still) cheap oil we receive because of military presence and power structures which lead back to colonization.
Earth is a prison planet of some sorts for evil spirits or what ever you wanna call it. We are seemingly alone in infinite space. There aren&#39;t any exits and there isn&#39;t anything we are able to perceive that is above us that would help us. There is no god and we have to suffer. It&#39;s perhaps a cosmic prison for evil spirits and the wardens are higher lifeforms. Perhaps it&#39;s like in the Matrix, that we simple aren&#39;t equipped with the sensory tools to understand and sense our chains.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that exactly what the Buddhists talk about with the wheel of life? They try to achieve to reach nirvana and break out of this dimension, by being good and repent their sins.</p>

<p>We live in infinite space on this one small planet. Even with light speed we couldn&#39;t escape this universe.
I think what humanity created with technological and human cooperation is an arrow of progress which is driven by the primal fear of going back into past hell and this arrow is only possible by our hope of escape.
I hope someone likes to get into more detail and discuss my theory. Also i might have the sense that this is common knowledge and everyone already knows it, so perhaps i am just the last retard that gets it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are ready for Buddhism my friend. The universe, according to most forms of Buddhism has 6 realms - the wheel of life that you mentioned. The hell realm, the ghost realm, the animal real, the human realm, the demi-god realm, and the god realm. The human realm is said to be right in the middle of the spectrum of suffering, and that existence itself (as our perspective of existence is a delusion) is suffering. As long as you don&#39;t overcome the feeling of suffering when living in this world of suffering, you&#39;re in a kind of hell. Hell is just one point on a spectrum of suffering and there&#39;s plenty to go around. The specific suffering for each person is different, but it&#39;s all suffering and you&#39;ve been able to mention a lot of examples. You are not able to sense your chains, that&#39;s right, but you don&#39;t fix it by being good and repenting your sins. That would only improve your karma and get you a better rebirth while infinitely cycling through reincarnation. You &quot;escape the matrix&quot; by being enlightened and breaking through the illusion of your existence. Buddhism has the six ayatana or six gates, and your current level of consciousness is constricted to these senses only. When you break through the false, &quot;self-other&quot; duality, understand the Buddhist concept of &quot;emptiness,&quot; you&#39;ll see the universe differently and be free from the self-imposed mental prison that you&#39;re in. Then you will have woken up from this dream of life and experience &quot;reality&quot; for the first time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go listen to some Alan Watts, Eckhart Tolle, and Ram Dass lectures on youtube. You&#39;re right and wrong about this idea. Hell is in your mind, and if you&#39;re miserable, you can have all the material shit on the planet and it won&#39;t alleviate your misery... on the other hand, given you can find food, shelter, water... all you need is love. No hippy bullshit. Find the excitement in fear, don&#39;t allow anxiety to rule your feelings towards the future, instead live in the moment and really engage with other people. Look them in the eyes, see that we are consciousness moving through a dimension we call time. Go watch the Mandelbrot set on Youtube... then imagine if that played out in all directions for an infinite amount of time. There you are.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t get your opinions from the Internet, especially r/conspiracy this place is shill city! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve definitely thought this before. Your perspective is similar to that of Buddhism, so you can imagine many people have thought it before ;) It&#39;s a scary thought, though. It is my perpetual philosophical struggle to move between your hypothesis and a couple of other viewpoints.</p>

<p>I guess contrasting to this is Taoism, which asserts that this earthliness is also godly, our sin being to have deviated from the will of nature; if we can live in harmony with and according to the laws and lessons of nature, then that too is a kind of nirvana.</p>

<p>Part of the hell of this place is not knowing if there will be existential consequences for our actions. Are atheists truly convinced they will never face any judgement? I can&#39;t believe they are. The evil machinations of man are awful and many, so what sense of morality that believes in no existential consequence for their actions can resist such temptation? Thus, I cannot believe it.</p>

<p>But yes, to think, this world would be far less hellish if we actually KNEW what the fuck was going on. WHAT happens after death; WHY are we here. Nobody knows this. If we knew one way or another we could get on with just doing whatever we want and to hell with the consequences, or strive to live morally, learn and improve with the knowledge it leads to an actual spiritual ascension.</p>

<p>But, we don&#39;t. So we never truly devote ourselves to one pursuit or the other, because we fear the consequences or fear that our efforts are futile and worthless.</p>

<p>Even that, though, hints at an escape. Perhaps that&#39;s the joy of having real faith in a religion or lack thereof. To be truly committed to a metaphysical model would feel great, I imagine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>someone say that though being on earth is a very challenging place to be, full of suffering, Earth literally means hell, because of this it allows for a chance at great progress and development of consciousness awareness if you approach in the right way.. Nothing is learned from an easy life.
As long you don&#39;t take things seriously, and always remember that nothing is permanent, theres nothing to get anxious over.
This is the world of mana. Constant change.
It is rather a crude existence. To be moved by desire for possessions and achievements and things, but it will always slip through your grasp without fail. people can easily become trapped.
If people allow themselves to be pulled into it its hard to get back out.
An endless cycle it could end up being. But eventually people have to climb back out of the hole they dug for them self.
I recomend 2 things for reading. Unveiled mysteries by godfre ray king.
And power of now by eckart tolle</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be hell because we&#39;re trapped in the physical realm, or at least what we perceive to be the physical realm if this is a hologram or computer simulation.  This is also described in Christian terms also- correct me if I&#39;m wrong.  The flesh is corrupt.  The body craves this thing or another and is never satisfied.  People are willing to do evil acts if it satisfies some need the body craves and this is the problem.  Anything to keep the meatbag going and the mind happy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My quick attempt to format for the OP:</p>
