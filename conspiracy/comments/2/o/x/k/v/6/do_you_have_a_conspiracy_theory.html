<p>Right on brother. Preach.</p>

<p>FTFY. Sheep are unaware of the sheepiness (my new favorite word, by the way). Congratulations. Welcome aboard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can only try our best to live the happiest sheep lives possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Not <strong>only</strong>. Your job now is to educate yourself on your unsheepiness. And then, when the time is right, and you see a fellow sheep that you care about, that you love, that you cherish, walking by a mirror, you need only to point them towards it. Sometimes the mere reflection is enough to snap people out of it. Others need you to draw a diagram for them. You need not yell</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WAKE UP SHEEPLE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A la Alex Jones, that is not effective. Just a polite respectful nudge toward the mirror&#39;s direction. It is their responsibility to look, as you cannot look for them, and it is their own journey.</p>

<p>But you are not allowed to go back to the flock and pretend to be a sheep again. Partly because it will not work (at least for me, I have tried), but because in all likelihood, you are now forever changed, and they do not want you any more. <em>But we do</em>.</p>

<p><em>I do</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve kinda always seen it, but like I&#39;ve just never had the power to change it, so all I&#39;ve wanted to do is accept it, and focus on the shit that makes me happy. E.I family, friends, partners, sports, vices. I see it, and I want to change it, but the only thing people pay attention to is money. But like most people,  I owe money let alone have any to be able to get anyone&#39;s attention. I know it&#39;s me kind of laying down and taking it in the end, but if i think about it too much, it will just make me miserable. Thanks for opening up your arms to me, and making me feel wanted.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m picking up what you&#39;re putting down, former sheepster.</p>

<p>But!  Do. Not. Despair.</p>

<p>You are doing everything as you are supposed to. You cannot change the world in one fell swoop - you must first focus inward, on yourself, and accept certain things - but one of them <em>is not</em> the possibility that you cannot leave this world in a better condition then you found it.</p>

<p>Now - imagine a scenario where everybody feels that way. I. Mean. Everyone.</p>

<p>But we&#39;re thinking too big right now comrade - we&#39;re focusing inward. Gotta get right mentally. Gotta realize that every single day (unless you&#39;re like that gas-mask wearing off-the-gridder from last night&#39;s self-post extravaganza) you have thousands of opportunities to improve things. This isn&#39;t a strange way of saying</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pick up that can, citizen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But a way of saying - smile. Look them dead in the eyes and see who even looms back. Most are too scared oe skittish to even do this anymore, they&#39;d rather be buried in their Galaxy S8 than have a normal human interaction. Smile at every single person you see in the elevator, in class, crossing the street, cutting you off on the road. At some point, they&#39;ll smile back, and maybe you&#39;ll realize we&#39;re all on the same team. We&#39;re all little cogs in this machination we call Life, and when the cogs stop working, the machine loses its power.</p>

<p>When the cogs reorganize for <em>their benefit</em>, and not the machine maker, that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about. But it starts with you holding the door for someone <strong>tomorrow morning</strong>, smiling, wishing them a nice day, and <strong>fucking meaning it</strong>. Pay for that dude&#39;s coffee behind you in line tomorrow and hope he pays it forward. </p>

<p>The sum of our actions is far larger than any individual, and we have lost the way.</p>

<p>Tendons tend to rust with time. Qires misplace their currents. There&#39;s no better time to Flee The Factory, friend, but we cannot do it alone. And it starts tomorrow for you.</p>

<p>Long days and pleasant nights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try everyday to show at everyone as much as possible, and manly for my own benefit, positivity I have found, attracts positive things in life for me, and negativity has only attracted negative things. Sure I can&#39;t control everything, but I can control my attitude, and how I let things affect me and I can hope my positive mentality rubs off on people who need it, and attracts me to others who carry it. I love the feeling of connecting with a stranger, whether it is just through a look, or through a conversation. Everyone has something interesting to say, if you take the time to listen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;i&quot; in &quot;iPhone&quot; and &quot;iPad&quot; stands for Illuminati.</p>

<p>Siri never sleeps. She is always listening, and transcribes every conversation within microphone range to text, to be indexed and uploaded to Apple the next time you sync with iTunes. That, along with your GPS locations throughout the day, periodic pictures from the front/rear cameras, your phone conversations and social information, all your text messages, all your username/passwords...</p>

<p>And iTunes has you positively identified when you setup your account with your financial information.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s no easy way to disable the microphone or the cameras, you can&#39;t even remove the battery, and you just have to take iOS&#39;s word that the GPS has been disabled. (I have my iPad2 in Airplane Mode, and it still tries to use the GSM radio every 30 minutes or so -- throws an error &quot;SIM card not found&quot;.) The iPhone6 even collects your fingerprint. And iOS is closed-source, so you can&#39;t even audit the code.</p>

<p>So Apple has all this information on you, cross-referenced with your identity.</p>

<p>You just had to bite that Apple, didn&#39;t you? (Check the <a href="http://www.logostage.com/logos/Apple.png">logo</a> -- note the symbolism of the bitten apple from the Garden of Eden, the tilted all-seeing eyeball, and the Saturn swoosh.)</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Apple product line is inventory control for the Illuminati. We humans are the inventory, their most valuable (and difficult to manage) asset.</p>

<p>Again, I just don&#39;t think that certain types of &quot;fun&quot; aren&#39;t very intelligent.</p>

<p>Trying to come up with &quot;the best <em>fake</em> conspiracy theory&quot; really sounds like something conspiratard would do - not this sub - and conspiratard is basically a parasite subreddit that was specifically created to try to make anyone look stupid who isn&#39;t willing to blindly follow TPTB narrative on everything.</p>

<p>See, the problem with this mentality right here that you show is that you (I imagine) aren&#39;t understanding that that particular sub might not only run with whatever you ask or suggest, but actually use those questions/suggestions to spur on more ideas to come back to this sub and troll it with - passing along false information as true so as to confuse things even more than is already the case.</p>

<p>My question essentially is:  Why would you want to give them any more fuel to continue trolling with?</p>

<p>&quot;Well I was joking, man.  Lighten up.&quot; might be your response, but it&#39;s not all that funny when others with negative intentions actually <em>do</em> possibly use your ideas to soil the already muddied waters that individuals who are really trying to do some real investigation are trying to clean up.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I take exception to it.  It blurs the lines between what is b.s. and what isn&#39;t - and that is the LAST thing that anyone trying to really figure things out should want.</p>

<p>Okay...so let me see if I&#39;m understanding this question correctly.</p>

<p>&quot;You are given as much money, and popularity and attention [as] you need to get one truth out there to the populas, but you can only tell the people <del>of</del> one theory that you yourself believe<del>s</del> to be true.&quot;</p>

<p>If I&#39;m reading this right, all you&#39;re basically asking is &quot;What one theory that you believe to be true would you get out to the public??&quot;</p>

<p>One of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Off planet beings and civilizations have been and currently are visiting this planet.</p></li>
<li><p>We are not human beings that occasionally have spiritual experiences.  We are spiritual beings currently having human experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>All the racial, ethnic, gender, social, class, religious divisions, etc that exist are all false indoctrinations brainwashed into the masses to keep us separate and antagonistic to one another because this division makes us much, much easier to control and manipulate.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure which one I would go with, as all three truths are indeed pretty darn important.</p>

<p>I feel you and people like you don&#39;t think <em>enough</em>.  I guess it&#39;s just a matter of perspective.</p>

<p>You expressed a different thought in each sentence, and I was/am respecting you enough to actually respond to each different thought pattern separately.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually called attentiveness, respecting, and honoring another I&#39;m communicating with.</p>

<p>Many people who aren&#39;t used to doing this call it &quot;thinking too much&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;d ultimately go with the third one, I guess, as uniting together as the one human family that we are I feel would help the entire race and the planet <em>immensely</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>People like me, just realize that life is short</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And people like me realize that this idea could not be further from the actual truth because the fact of the matter is that life is, in fact, eternal.  Personal identity exists independent of the temporary, ephemeral, physical vehicle it occasionally manifests itself in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>over thinking things that we can&#39;t change is just going to bring on more stress</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly do you mean when you say &quot;over thinking&quot;, however?</p>

<p>If you really stop and think about it - a thing you&#39;ve admitted you don&#39;t do/like to do - then you&#39;d realize that, while there are some things we can&#39;t change, there are some things we can, and not worrying about all the things we actually <em>can</em> change ensures that you end up being a mindless nothing flung this way and that by every change that takes place in your life.  As such, at least <em>some</em> level of volition is not a bad thing.</p>

<p>Knowing how to differentiate between what you can change and what you cannot is <em>not</em> a bad thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d personally would rather just to live a simple life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As would I, but don&#39;t confuse &quot;simple&quot; with &quot;unquestioning&quot; or &quot;unthinking&quot;.  Those can be <em>very</em> different things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and focus on the lighter side to life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s all good and well, but if life itself decided to accost and attack you with the <em>heavier</em> side of things and you&#39;re just focused on the lighter side of things?  Then you&#39;re likely to get blindsided by what happens and will likely end up pretty messed up, if not traumatized.  And <em>that&#39;s</em> not good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rather than letting my brain run too much</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  To each their own.  If we lived in an &quot;easy&quot;, no-thinking-required kind of world, then this would likely not be a bad thing to do.  However, it seems that this planet is rife with manipulation and forces covertly working to exact one nefarious end or another upon us.  Under those circumstances, a brain that doesn&#39;t &quot;run too much&quot; is simply all too easy to manipulate and take advantage of...usually to the individual in question&#39;s great detriment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and letting it destroy me with all the negative things in life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s fair.  I understand that sentiment.  However, the fact of the matter is that there ARE a lot of difficult, negative, harrowing things that happen in this life, and a lot of times what you don&#39;t know CAN indeed hurt you very badly.  For that reason, it doesn&#39;t seem like a horrible thing to at least have SOME semblance of a focused, responsible mind that is aware of the negative things that <em>can</em> indeed happen.</p>

<p>Doing such never ever needs to &quot;destroy&quot; you or make you think about &quot;all the negative things in life&quot;.  You don&#39;t have to go <em>that</em> far with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe in your perspective, I do not think enough, but its not because I do not know how to, its because I&#39;m simply just a happy person when try not to over think things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the fact that you were previously willing to link some images that were obviously designed at least to <em>some</em> extent to ridicule or make fun of another being for not &quot;lightening up&quot; shows that you do indeed have a less than positive side to you not very far from the surface.  That side shows that you&#39;re <em>not</em> quite as &quot;light and happy&quot; as you might want to let on.</p>

<p>Being &quot;happy&quot; at the expense of others...is not ultimately being a very good person.</p>

<p>...but then again, perhaps that&#39;s the key here...Perhaps you might not be interested at all in actually being a &quot;good&quot; person, but, instead, are only interested and focused on simply being &quot;happy&quot; regardless of what else is happening or at whoever&#39;s expense that &quot;happiness&quot; might happen under.  If such is the case, then so be it.  However, such a modus operandi tends to always be self-defeating because happiness at the expense of goodness ultimately corrodes the happiness itself (since it&#39;s actually not <em>real</em> happiness), and those individuals that comport themselves in this way usually end up all the worse for wear in the end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not able to disconnect my emotions from my thoughts, so the deeper I think, the deeper I feel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, although you don&#39;t seem to understand this fact, this is actually a GOOD thing.  You likely see it as a very frightening and bad thing - a thing that means that you can only think &quot;happy thoughts&quot; at all times or you&#39;ll end up feeling horrible.</p>

<p>Well, life and existence is actually much, much deeper than that, and there are levels of reality that are 1) very enriching, but that 2) can only be accessed as you delve deeper into reality...passed the &quot;shiny happy thoughts&quot; only...past the pain and the difficulty.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not willing to pass the pain and difficulty that exists at the 3ft depth because you only want to be &quot;happy&quot;, then you&#39;ll likely always stay in the shallow kiddy pool area of existence and that&#39;s it.  If you&#39;re willing to go deeper, however, then what will happen is that - yes - you will indeed likely come across some serious difficulty and pain and discomfort, but if you keep going, you will also be able to encounter a level of goodness and positivity as you go deeper that you never would have ever been able to experience at the shallower depths of &quot;only happy thoughts!&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You probably are not as emotional as I am</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know you, so I can&#39;t say if I am or am not as emotional as you are.  I <em>can</em> say that I value emotion greatly, and, well...people that aren&#39;t emotional don&#39;t tend to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ghjgt/iama_person_who_gave_a_complete_stranger_cpr_this/">risk their lives for complete strangers</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it may be easier for you to disconnect all your thoughts, from your emotions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually strive <em>not</em> to.  I strive to do the very opposite of that.  I strive to make my mind and my heart and my thoughts and my emotions one collective entity all working together and in unison with one another.  I just also strive toward making them be able to go as deep as they can into the very marrow of existence itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so using your brain to think on such a deeper level is probably something that brings you happiness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say &quot;happiness&quot;.  Using my brain, I have found, is just one (but not the only) manner of being better able to asses the world around me is all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where as I get mine from keeping it simple. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>You might not know anything about this...but you seem more apt toward working in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga">Bhakti Yoga</a> realm of things, while I am more wont to work in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga">Jnana yoga</a> realm.</p>

<p>They both ultimately lead to the same Oneness, the same Source, in the end though, so either or is quite alright.</p>

<p>People like me, just realize that life is short</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And people like me realize that this idea could not be further from the actual truth because the fact of the matter is that life is, in fact, eternal.  Personal identity exists independent of the temporary, ephemeral, physical vehicle it occasionally manifests itself in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>over thinking things that we can&#39;t change is just going to bring on more stress</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly do you mean when you say &quot;over thinking&quot;, however?</p>

<p>If you really stop and think about it - a thing you&#39;ve admitted you don&#39;t do/like to do - then you&#39;d realize that, while there are some things we can&#39;t change, there are some things we can, and not worrying about all the things we actually <em>can</em> change ensures that you end up being a mindless nothing flung this way and that by every change that takes place in your life.  As such, at least <em>some</em> level of volition is not a bad thing.</p>

<p>Knowing how to differentiate between what you can change and what you cannot is <em>not</em> a bad thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d personally would rather just to live a simple life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As would I, but don&#39;t confuse &quot;simple&quot; with &quot;unquestioning&quot; or &quot;unthinking&quot;.  Those can be <em>very</em> different things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and focus on the lighter side to life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s all good and well, but if life itself decided to accost and attack you with the <em>heavier</em> side of things and you&#39;re just focused on the lighter side of things?  Then you&#39;re likely to get blindsided by what happens and will likely end up pretty messed up, if not traumatized.  And <em>that&#39;s</em> not good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rather than letting my brain run too much</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  To each their own.  If we lived in an &quot;easy&quot;, no-thinking-required kind of world, then this would likely not be a bad thing to do.  However, it seems that this planet is rife with manipulation and forces covertly working to exact one nefarious end or another upon us.  Under those circumstances, a brain that doesn&#39;t &quot;run too much&quot; is simply all too easy to manipulate and take advantage of...usually to the individual in question&#39;s great detriment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and letting it destroy me with all the negative things in life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s fair.  I understand that sentiment.  However, the fact of the matter is that there ARE a lot of difficult, negative, harrowing things that happen in this life, and a lot of times what you don&#39;t know CAN indeed hurt you very badly.  For that reason, it doesn&#39;t seem like a horrible thing to at least have SOME semblance of a focused, responsible mind that is aware of the negative things that <em>can</em> indeed happen.</p>

<p>Doing such never ever needs to &quot;destroy&quot; you or make you think about &quot;all the negative things in life&quot;.  You don&#39;t have to go <em>that</em> far with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe in your perspective, I do not think enough, but its not because I do not know how to, its because I&#39;m simply just a happy person when try not to over think things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the fact that you were previously willing to link some images that were obviously designed at least to <em>some</em> extent to ridicule or make fun of another being for not &quot;lightening up&quot; shows that you do indeed have a less than positive side to you not very far from the surface.  That side shows that you&#39;re <em>not</em> quite as &quot;light and happy&quot; as you might want to let on.</p>

<p>Being &quot;happy&quot; at the expense of others...is not ultimately being a very good person.</p>

<p>...but then again, perhaps that&#39;s the key here...Perhaps you might not be interested at all in actually being a &quot;good&quot; person, but, instead, are only interested and focused on simply being &quot;happy&quot; regardless of what else is happening or at whoever&#39;s expense that &quot;happiness&quot; might happen under.  If such is the case, then so be it.  However, such a modus operandi tends to always be self-defeating because happiness at the expense of goodness ultimately corrodes the happiness itself (since it&#39;s actually not <em>real</em> happiness), and those individuals that comport themselves in this way usually end up all the worse for wear in the end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not able to disconnect my emotions from my thoughts, so the deeper I think, the deeper I feel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, although you don&#39;t seem to understand this fact, this is actually a GOOD thing.  You likely see it as a very frightening and bad thing - a thing that means that you can only think &quot;happy thoughts&quot; at all times or you&#39;ll end up feeling horrible.</p>

<p>Well, life and existence is actually much, much deeper than that, and there are levels of reality that are 1) very enriching, but that 2) can only be accessed as you delve deeper into reality...passed the &quot;shiny happy thoughts&quot; only...past the pain and the difficulty.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not willing to pass the pain and difficulty that exists at the 3ft depth because you only want to be &quot;happy&quot;, then you&#39;ll likely always stay in the shallow kiddy pool area of existence and that&#39;s it.  If you&#39;re willing to go deeper, however, then what will happen is that - yes - you will indeed likely come across some serious difficulty and pain and discomfort, but if you keep going, you will also be able to encounter a level of goodness and positivity as you go deeper that you never would have ever been able to experience at the shallower depths of &quot;only happy thoughts!&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You probably are not as emotional as I am</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know you, so I can&#39;t say if I am or am not as emotional as you are.  I <em>can</em> say that I value emotion greatly, and, well...people that aren&#39;t emotional don&#39;t tend to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ghjgt/iama_person_who_gave_a_complete_stranger_cpr_this/">risk their lives for complete strangers</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it may be easier for you to disconnect all your thoughts, from your emotions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually strive <em>not</em> to.  I strive to do the very opposite of that.  I strive to make my mind and my heart and my thoughts and my emotions one collective entity all working together and in unison with one another.  I just also strive toward making them be able to go as deep as they can into the very marrow of existence itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so using your brain to think on such a deeper level is probably something that brings you happiness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say &quot;happiness&quot;.  Using my brain, I have found, is just one (but not the only) manner of being better able to asses the world around me is all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where as I get mine from keeping it simple. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>You might not know anything about this...but you seem more apt toward working in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga">Bhakti Yoga</a> realm of things, while I am more wont to work in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga">Jnana yoga</a> realm.</p>

<p>They both ultimately lead to the same Oneness, the same Source, in the end though, so either or is quite alright.</p>

<p>Sure maybe one day your type will rule the world</p>

<p>What &quot;type&quot; is that?  Rule the world?  Why would my &quot;type&quot; <em>want</em> to?  What is the benefit in that?</p>

<p>Better to rule <em>yourself</em>.</p>

<p>and I&#39;ll probably always be a simpleton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na, man.  I&#39;m not calling you a &quot;simpleton&quot;.  Never did.  I&#39;m just saying that this life seems complicated and difficult, and it definitely seems that there is more going on here than just &quot;being happy&quot; is all.</p>

<p>I know with everything that I am, that if I died tomorrow, I will have lived a life I loved, a life that fulfilled my soul.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great.  Awesome.  No sarcasm.  That&#39;s good for you.</p>

<p>If I died <em>right now</em>, I would know that I lived this life trying to do the best that I absolutely could with things, and I&#39;d hope that that would at least count for something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that is enough for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah...Well, that would <em>have</em> to be enough for me...because that&#39;s all I have.  Doing my best is all I have...and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>I would know that I at least did as best as I could.  I would know that I am absolutely not perfect, but that I did the best that I could with what I had/what I was given.</p>
