       I would like to remind the users of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that EVERYTHING here is considered controversial on other parts of reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can speak freely about 9-11 truth here because the mods protect this space against people who would have it otherwise.  So when you see something you don't like, don't be so quick to become that guy who tries to shut down the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can speak freely about Sandy Hook because the mods protect this space against people who would have it otherwise.  When you find something you don't like, don't be so quick to try and shut it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can speak freely here about UFOs and Aliens, We can speak freely about CIA torture and Israeli aggression. etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This latest AMA (The announcement for Cole) that has so many feelings hurt isn't any different.  If something here offends you then YOU need to click on a different page, a different article or maybe even just take a break from reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't fair for you to enjoy this space when the topic is something that you are interested in and then to flip a switch and make this space a miserable place when the topic moves on to something that you find offensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       9-11 conspiracies are offensive to people.
Sandy Hook conspiracies are offensive to people.
Boston bombing conspiracies are offensive to people.
anti-government/military conspiracies are offensive to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you get offended, be careful not to become the troll that ruins your own favorite subjects.  And if you do become that troll, don't be offended a second time if you get removed from the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some things are controversial, even for us.

      <p>
       Good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of my mutant mod powers, I have the ability to "see" comments from users that either are new or shadowbanned accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       These comments appear "faded" compared to normal users. If you're a mod in any sub, you can see them.
      </p>
      <p>
       To prevent constant account creation and brigading in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , new users have to wait a few days before posting to the sub. After that point they're not restricted.
      </p>
      <p>
       As mods, we can see these new users and their posts. I almost always approve these comments and posts, as long as the poster seems genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if a comment is faded out and clicking the user name brings me the dreaded "page not found" screen, I automatically know the user has been shadowbanned.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I approve the user's comment (as long as it's appropriate, which it almost always is), and then I inform them of their situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's pretty much the limit of what we can do.

       One side benefit of shadowbanning (if I understand this correctly) is that the banned user usually doesn't realize that it's happened. I would guess that it might take them a while before they realize nobody is responding to their comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This should delay them from setting up a new account for at least a little while.

       It's essentially a "punishment" that can only be given by the admins of reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Users can be shadowbanned for a variety of reasons, and they generally have to do with breaking reddit's terms of service, such as brigading, doxxing, and other dastardly deeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think sometimes IP addresses are blocked as well, so newly created accounts from the same location are similarly screwed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shadowbanned users can, however, message the mods of any subreddit. These messages are shaded with a reddish pink color that's really obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mod mail is frequently spammed by shadowbanned users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes, however, shadowbans are unjust or mistakes. Some users opt to contact the reddit admins, plead their case, and the bans can be reversed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it happens, certain "types" have been trying to get me shadowbanned for years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since I haven't broken any rules, their efforts are just silly. The year+ worth of reddit gold I've been given probably helps my account's standing as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that clears a few things up. If I got anything wrong maybe someone will chime it and correct me.

       Sorry I'm not trying to be dense, and thanks for the reply - but do you mean they are banned in the traditional sense of the word, and their IP is logged to show newly created accounts in the future?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are banned but can still message admins to over turn it if it was a perceived mistake, as a posed to banned banned where they can no longer use that account?

      <p>
       Are banned from the sub?

      <p>
       Or comments colour is altered to notify admins 'hey look at this guy'?

For a shadowbanned user their account appears normal - they are able post comments and so on, upvote etc. However, nobody else can see them (or their comments) and if you click on a shadowbanned user's comment page you get "page not found". In other words, it might take some time for a shadowbanned to user to even realise they're...dead. Mods, however, see dead people.

       It is odd how they dont just delete an account. See with shadow ban you cant send messages either. What you can do is edit comments or posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also downvote but you cannot upvote. And as a mod you cannot approve your own posts cought by the spam filter.

       It was explained to me by another admin it was for bots but works just as good for real users too.

       Admin wont go against one of their own either. I find that admirable myself. The ones I know personally are good folks thou. They make decisions together for the most part. And are not the free speech haters some portray them to be.

       Maybe not but I don't know how to explain the huge amount of manipulation and censorship that goes on on this site without the admins being at least passively complicit.  They either let it happen or they help it happen, I don't really see a third option.

       Who knows. I came to the realization that the site is free (not costing us users anything)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also that its entertainment.  Technically they owe us nothing as admin or as owners of the site. So we really cant bitch about it. Now if you had to pay then yes that would be different.

       I've accepted this as well - the problem comes because reddit has a reputation (that it's worked hard to cultivate) of being user-driven where posts are voted on organically and peoples' opinions are reflected in the vote totals for comments and posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is simply fiction.  It's not how the site works at all.  And in my opinion it says something about the admins that they allow so much corporate shilling and vote manipulation to occur.  Maybe I'm imaging it but it's all seemed to have gotten worse since Aaron died.

       This is more controversial news sub then conspiracy anymore. The majority of people post something and never comment on it themself or weigh in about how they feel on what they posted.

       Or they have nothing but a history of submissions and no comments. I dont like that myself.

       Christianity is a false religion designed to destroy true spirituality. It is a religion designed to make the "Gentile" a slave who worships the Jewish false god Yahweh, a sacrificial lamb for his demonic lordship.

       Well said. Cultural Marxism attacks white heterosexual men who don't cut off their penises ("cisgenders") as they are the biggest threat to the NWO. Traditional values are also under attack. It's all quite "progressive".

       You know what I've always wondered about the Jesus story, if they could place the door on the tomb, why couldn't a group of people just come back after the fact , move the door again, and removed the body and hey presto - he's achieved apotheosis.

       When you find out when the New Testament was written and
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">
        collated into a single "book"
       </a>
       you will realise that literally everything in it is a work of fiction. Jesus was not a real person, just like Sherlock Holmes was not a real person - a pure work of fiction. There is no historical or documentary evidence that a Jesus of Nazareth (or any other character in the New Testament apart from Herod) existed from the supposed lifetime of this person.

       Not really, archaeology is pretty evident. Thousands of years of evidence sorta paints a chronology of evolutionary ideas... especially when ideas are used for political reasons because then there is

       I'm trying to explain to you that we do have a way of knowing, it's called Archaeology and/or Anthropology. There is
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       evidence dictating his evolution from a pagan canaanite god... that came from a mesopotamian god.... those gods were worshipped and attributed man-made manufactured qualities based on the behaviour of the time... however...

       This is where you're actually spot on; most of the pagan deities from antiquity were derived from
       <em>
        astronomical interpretation
       </em>
       - The peoples of that ancient far eastern civilisation used the stars and the night sky as basis for their theologies. :)

       That may even be the most likely interpretation. However, I tend to think of Yahweh and Ra as the same evil spiritual entity, who goes by many names. Whoever he may be, he is the great deceiver. If he exists. That he does, I am not certain. But there is evidence that some evil force does exist that is beyond the flesh.

       Astrology does interest me. And it seems that the "elite" are quite infatuated with it, and with the gods as well. Lots of things indicate that astrology/astronomy is a lot more important to our everyday lives than science might have us believe.

       You sorta need to know the political systems of the past or else you just won't understand any evidence or specifics.

       <em>
        political

       Yes! Christianity in its early stages was a fairly populist movement of individual 'spiritual' activity (or at least locally decentralized with an evangelical) but the establishment of the many archbishoprics around the Mediterranean later on created regional dogma, which was then polarized between East and West (Roman Catholicism).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the schism, pretty much all dissenting sects not conforming to the dialectic were wiped out and their texts for the most part too. Regardless of whether any of these sects were 'right' doesn't matter, it just shows that the same divide and conquer strategy has been used in every age and for every nonconformist movement.

       Mmmyea exactly. Basically as you explained it, early christianity was actually a Caesarian cult trying to convince jews that the flavian dynasty were their messiah... as imaginable that didn't go down too well so they had to heavily change it's dogma in order for it to convert a large number of levantine people. However it was always just a roman controlled sect of generic judaism until much later when
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       (before constantine, speculated to be a political body (oligarchs) linked to the old Mithras cult, based on political mannerisms and such there is a hint of some persian involvement too) completely changed it. They introduced new mythology, incorporating new rituals and beliefs based on other local religions (paganism, zoroastrianism, mithrazism etc.). This is also when their founder 'st. paul/saul' and messiah 'Jesus (Yeshua)' first appears (about 100-150ish years after their apparent existence, leading archaeologists to believe they were both made up.

       Well, the moderators don't apply the rules equally to all users. I personally have been targeted and warned for BS twice. I started reporting a lot of users for personal attacks after I was told that even calling someone "ignorant" is a personal attack (if I do it at least), but they are almost never warned, even though their attacks are far more offensive, proving I was targeted specifically. The moderators aren't really doing their jobs. Worse, they're targeting users like me who they disagree with instead of applying the rules fairly. They are even changing the enforcement of the rules specifically to attack me. They also don't seem to believe they have any accountability whatsoever. I was hoping
       <a href="/u/Ambiguously_Ironic">
        /u/Ambiguously_Ironic
       </a>
       would stand up against these obvious abuses as he seems honorable, but apparently not.

       Correct.  There's the quantitative application of some rules (where almost anyone will get the ban hammer if they do "such and such") and qualitative application (where other factors get weighed as well and sometimes the ban hammer won't get dropped on one user where it would on another).

       Well...that's...weird, and I wonder if there is more to the whole situation than being warned simply for calling someone "ignorant"...because I myself can be a fucking

       asshole on here (lol), and even though I've been warned before, I think I would have been banned a LOOOONG time ago if calling someone "ignorant" was a bannable offense...cuz I've called many people a LOT more than just "ignorant". lol

       Ohhh.  Wait a minute...I just noticed your user name.  I
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       you and I might have gotten into a bit of a "spat" not too long ago (if I remember correctly - which I may not, since there are literally SOOO damn many people that I get in online "spats" with) and I think I remember feeling that you were being pretty nit pickingly antagonistic...or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know.  Again, I don't really remember what the conversation was even about - and really I don't even care, in all honesty - but, if (again) I'm even
       <em>
        vaguely
       </em>
       remembering correctly, I think your approach to conversations with other people on here is generally antagonistic in nature...even if you're not specifically calling people bannable things, you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, I think you might fall under the "qualitative" parameters I mentioned above.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the moderators AREN'T by any means perfect, so it's not like I'm sticking up for any individual in particular here.  I'm just calling the shots as I personally see them.

       There are a few immediate perspectives with regard to this possibility:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They are and that is indeed pretty fucked up.

       <li>

         They're not, and you're 1) a pretty shitty user, and 2) being a bit paranoid.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm not saying which one it is, as I don't know for sure myself (so don't get upset or offended, because I'm
       <em>
        not

       saying that the second option is necessarily the case), just saying that there

       I didn't feel it was your being "blunt" that was an issue.  I think it was something else - though I don't remember what.  It wasn't the bluntness.  It, I think, might have been either sarcasm or some snarkiness or whatever.

       Either way, it's all good.  Not worrying about that at this point at all.

       But one should definitely understand and keep in mind the law of balances.  If you have group A that takes advantage of group B for generations, and you want to make some attempt at
       <em>
        balancing
       </em>
       that horrendous
       <em>
        imbalance
       </em>
       that A was responsible for, then you actually
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to institute various programs designed to RE-balance B in such a manner that they are now given opportunities that they weren't given before; opportunities that A might not get...but that's only because A
       <em>
        started off
       </em>
       in a position of power and authority that B never had ever
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's, in one sense, imbalanced and "unfair" that B gets certain concessions that A doesn't, but the reason that B gets those particular concessions is because A is advantaged overall to an extent that B has
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       been in the first place.

       When one doesn't think about it too deeply, I guess it does and would seem like a contentious topic.  However, when one looks at the issue objectively, one understands more that there is a great imbalance that is trying to be re-balanced, and, as such, things end up being similar to how things are now regarding this issue.

       The punishment you experience is likely almost nothing compared to that which many African Americans do as a result of the endemic, violent, oppressive, and institutionalized racism and slavery that was set in motion from as far back as the initial forming of the United States and is

       I cannot agree more, and what Europeans have been responsible for is an injustice that runs so multi-generationally deep that it will not and has not gone away just because a few decades have passed.

       Wow.  You

       think that the African American race
       <em>

       Either way, it ultimately doesn't matter because we should ALL simply put aside our bs indoctrinated "isms" and come together as the ONE human race that we most definitely are.  TPTB make sure and keep the majority of the population at odds with one another and make sure that people are kept antagonistic toward one another through race, religion, financial and sociological tags, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really is all bullshit, and so long as you or me or anyone continue to think that any one race should be favored above any other, we are ALL losing regardless of who we are.

       Okay wait a minute.  You don't think it's due to racism.  This implies, however, that you DO think that African Americans DO have it a lot worse than Europeans (just not "due to racism").

       In one sense, I don't think it's valuable at all either.  I'd prefer to not compare ANY racism of ANY people, as I feel we're all ONE PEOPLE AND ONE FAMILY.  However, I think it's even more important to make sure and
       <em>
        stomp racism out entirely
       </em>
       first...and you can't stomp it out without first ACKNOWLEDGING ITS EXISTENCE...and you can't acknowledge the existence of the horrible racism that exists against African Americans by spending too much if any time trying to make it seems like Europeans have it worse (!?!? Wut? lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       No one's saying that Europeans don't have problems.  We ALL have problems.  However, in terms of the issue of racism in the United States, there are two groups that have had it worse than ANYONE - the natives and African Americans - and anyone even TRYING to say otherwise just...simply is NOT paying any attention to almost
       <em>
        anything

       whatsoever.

       Somehow you don't realize that you're the one arguing for racially divisive discriminatory policies and comparing discrimination levels, asserting that "blacks have it A MILLION TIMES worse (e.g. whites should not complain) OMG" which is divisive. Equal treatment is the only answer, but that is not what you want, you want disparate treatment, you want to continue discriminatory practices such as affirmative action.

        But one should definitely understand and keep in mind the law of balances. If you have group A that takes advantage of group B for generations, and you want to make some attempt at balancing that horrendous imbalance that A was responsible for, then you actually have to institute various programs designed to RE-balance B in such a manner that they are now given opportunities that they weren't given before; opportunities that A might not get...but that's only because A started off in a position of power and authority that B never had ever at all.

       That was somewhat tried awhile back. Iirc around 80-85k subcount. I think what they did was require an account be at least 30 days old in order to post or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if it worked or not. I've been around since aprox 45k subcount so I've seen some shit go down in this sub and these days everything just seems really calm and mellow to me.

       It has been working like that since.  It works put pretty well, we ban a troll and then they automatically get snagged by automod when they make a new account and try to evade the ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only draw back is that there are occasionally legitimate new users who also get snagged, but we manually approve those users.

       Seems like a decent idea to me.  Of course there will be many that will get their panties in a wad about that.
       <em>

       .  That's likely an indicator that they want to be able to post whatever they want from sock puppets - preventing which is the whole point of instating that rule.

       obvious ones should always be banned asap imo. force them to be at least a little subtle about it. some are already of course. the techniques they employ have certainly evolved over the last year or so. for instance often you will see them use the "i agree with blah but..." or "i would never say blah but..." and they hardly ever try to go against the flow re:911 any longer.

       the users who were banned were banned for attacking people and mods.

       The AMA announcement isn't the place to ask mods to leave their post as a mod, unless of course the intent is to shut the AMA down.  Which isn't going to happen.

       False equivalency? Just because a known or obvious trolling account is banned does not mean its some sort of conspiracy. If you read the side bar, it explains both ;conspiracy' and 'theory.' Neother of which have to do with troll account removal. Perhaps if the idea of a troll account was anyone not following a certain narrative, but that's not the apparent case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is, there are known conspiracies on reddit to censor certain topics - its not that hard to see really. This sub however, is not one of them.

       In violation of the rule that was added a little over a year ago to enable mods to ban whomever they please. Not only that but you've been accusing specific users of shilling and brigading so I guess you can just ban yourself now. Or are mods exempt from rule 10?

       It is exactly how these situations have been handled for a long time.

       If you start name calling and trolling people you get banned.  So no, its not a threat of more stringent moderation, its just that the community here rarely misses the people who get banned because they don't really add anything of value...

       I agree. I enjoy questioning theories to test their merit under scrutiny. Some people aren't fond of that, but questioning is all part of an honest discussion. Scrutinizing is part of honest discourse. And anyone who questions the ideas here is called a shill or something similar. That is not ok because as soon as you start calling people shills,  the conversation can go no farther. If name calling is the first response, then the theory probably doesn't hold much water. Discussion is the key.

       This is simply not true. The people who get called shills are the ones who are trying to deny, denigrate and stymie discussion of alternatives to the official version of events.

       I would agree that shill is thrown around a little too liberally in here, but we did add that word specifically to rule 10, so it hasn't been as bad as it once was.

       firstly,
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't just ban people.  I banned two people who have been kicking this Gage AMA horse for weeks after its dead.  Its a dead horse! We aren't going to sacrifice a mod over it.  If anyone is blinded by anything, it is these 2 users who are blinded with anger so much that they are trying to ruin our next AMA.

      <p>
       second, I'm not stepping down.  Its not going to happen.

       Lastly, We use stickies to give air to topics that get habitually down voted by brigades.  We will also keep doing this because the brigades are a daily fact of life here.

       A point that needs to be made is the contradiction between the sentiments of "up or down vote everything you see here" and "if you don't like it, go somewhere else."
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are content rules overall for the sub, and I understand that your post here is probably geared more towards the comments and the conversation, however the lines that still seem to exist (unwritten or overt) seem to me to be hurting the sub almost as much as the shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, we need more detailed conversation. So when a post comes up that says something like "9/11 was done by Echelon with holographic planes from satellites in outer space," down vote it sure, but put forth evidence in the comments to correct the person to a more likely theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we just abolish every post that leans a little too far out there, those people (if they're NOT shills) will leave us, rather than be educated on the scientific method and realistic speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: If we get too overzealous, we'll likely lose members and end up looking like the neck beards we're trying to fight against.

       This statement applies to two situations, if something is highly up voted and you don't like.. oh well! Go somewhere else! No need to shit up the comments section and spam the report button.  And the other situation is, if you are here in /conspiracy and all you ever do is down vote stuff (you know who you are) then why exactly are you here in the first place?  Go somewhere else.

       The problem as I see it is that all conspiracies are not created equal. Conspiracies that turn out to be true ("Hey, we're torturing a lot of people") obviously have more legs to stand on than the more far out ones ("Hey, does this look like an Alien spaceship?")
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the more "serious" conspiracies are hurt by being grouped in with "less serious" conspiracies (however every user of this sub might have a different list for what is and isn't a serious conspiracy)...

       a violation of rule 10, or does it only apply to accuse mods?  Serious question.  I have nothing against the user, but if you're going to 'warn' someone you need to do it universally.  Otherwise you're being hypocritical.  Just sayin.

       There is a big difference between attacking specific users or this sub as a whole, and making a general statement about new accounts. Also, if you haven't noticed, each time a ban happens, they get other users who come in here saying "lol hypocrites" and so on.

        a violation of rule 10, or does it only apply to accused mods? Serious question.

       I responded to that. I'll let the mods speak for themselves about warnings. It seems to me that you're just trying to find a reason to be angry. The mods already give trolls too much leeway. I personally think all trolls should be banned.

       Maybe... I'm honest enough to admit that it has been a bad day and I might be interpreting things in a negative light.  That being said, it still seemed hypocritical to me.  But that is just my opinion, and what's that really worth?

       This comment was 4 months ago, it had nothing to do with the Hitler documentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're telling me that your main account was 2 years old but never made a comment until a 2 day period that started 4 months ago, and immediately started talking about how "conspiracy really hates the Jews" and you feel like this was unjust?
      </p>
      <p>
       We ban these sleeper accounts all the time, we see them on a daily basis.  I think your whole story just unraveled before our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So since that isn't the account that got banned for "politely voicing your concerns about the Hitler documentary" would you care to keep listing your banned accounts so that we can get to the bottom of this unjust ban you keep talking about?

       So what was the other account you got banned? The one you claim was voicing your concern about the Hitler doc.

       Can we see that one as well or is it equally incriminating?  You could always plead the 5th!

       Why doesn't your story about being unjustly banned for voicing concerns about the Hitler documentary, match up with the actual events that took place?  Could it be that you've had so many accounts banned here for trolling, that you've lost track of which is what?

       What? We are complaining about you and axol_p pushing Holocaust revisionism by pinning an AMA at the top of this sub, right after faking a Richard Gage AMA, and you're the same mods who threw up a red hitler poster and hitler revisionist doc during 9/11. You banned multiple users including me for calling out these failures as mods. Your judgement is poor and the power you hold is too much for you and your buddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discussing topics is different than pinning shitty holocaust AMAs after faking a Gage AMA. You cussed me out and gave me zero warnings before banning me and others.

       Well..considering the jews being involved in er thang and its always considered controversial says a lot about it being more than likely true? I dunno about yall but it sure seems like a hot button issue. Otherwise I agree we should remain open minded about a lot of stuff since we can be.

       look at
       <a href="/r/guns">

       , which has a dedicated hate subreddit for it. Look at what's happened in the gaming community, with
       <a href="/r/PCMasterRace">
        /r/PCMasterRace
       </a>
       constantly getting caught brigading and
       <a href="/r/games">

       , too, which I've heard is the subreddit with the most interventions from the admins over death threats and harassment.

      <p>
       Other subreddits have people that hate them, but no subreddit is so quick to ban then
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I don't want to jump on the band wagon witch-hunt against the mods (cos I don't think it's productive) but I too had been banned from this sub (old acc), as a result of 'disagreeing', this is a genuine issue and should be addressed.

       From your attitude and they way you talk to the people in this subreddit it does seem you have a chip on your shoulder or just immature. Why are you constantly arguing with the people in the subreddit you mod?  Does this not strike you as a problem?  It's just getting pretty ridiculous.

       I think I have done this in the past before, and I've gotten  a lot better about that kind of thing. 
Just because I think something doesn't mean that I'm correct because my ego tells me that I'm right. 
I think a lot of people suffer from that.

       Anyway, I will do my best to keep this kind of thing down on my part.

       If there is a difference, it doesn't matter because we will still allow it to be discussed freely without people like you trolling them for it.

       Also this is a warning, if you continue to disparage people in your comments you will be banned.  Nobody cares if you're offended or what you think is retarded.

       You guys do realize there is literally nothing you can do here right? You could somehow prove half the mods here are Zionist Jewish Nazi black presidential cabinet members.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would do nothing, you have no power other than creating something else and not coming here anymore. Which still wouldn't really do anything because you won't get even 25% of people to leave here. No power whatsoever.

      </p>
      <p>
       the users who were banned were banned for attacking people and mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       The AMA announcement isn't the place to ask mods to leave their post as a mod, unless of course the intent is to shut the AMA down.  Which isn't going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: to be clear, nobody was banned first and a reason found later.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I held my tongue for quite a long time watching 3 users trying to destroy and derail the announcement thread before I told anyone to fuck off, I am only human though.

       It's essentially a "punishment" that can only be given by the admins of reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Users can be shadowbanned for a variety of reasons, and they generally have to do with breaking reddit's terms of service, such as brigading, doxxing, and other dastardly deeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think sometimes IP addresses are blocked as well, so newly created accounts from the same location are similarly screwed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shadowbanned users can, however, message the mods of any subreddit. These messages are shaded with a reddish pink color that's really obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mod mail is frequently spammed by shadowbanned users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes, however, shadowbans are unjust or mistakes. Some users opt to contact the reddit admins, plead their case, and the bans can be reversed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it happens, certain "types" have been trying to get me shadowbanned for years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since I haven't broken any rules, their efforts are just silly. The year+ worth of reddit gold I've been given probably helps my account's standing as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that clears a few things up. If I got anything wrong maybe someone will chime it and correct me.

       In violation of the rule that was added a little over a year ago to enable mods to ban whomever they please. Not only that but you've been accusing specific users of shilling and brigading so I guess you can just ban yourself now. Or are mods exempt from rule 10?

Looking at your comment history you don't believe in the NWO, you don't believe the government carried out 9-11, Boston bombings, sandy hook and think man made global warming is real.

       Im blunt and that offends people so they respond with hostility and I respond in kind. I am also fed up with sheeple who for example try to make everything about cops a racial issue of evil whitey vs innocent black while simultaneously ignoring legalized discrimination  against whites (affirm action). That is one contentious topic. Others are leftism and the jewish question.

        But one should definitely understand and keep in mind the law of balances. If you have group A that takes advantage of group B for generations, and you want to make some attempt at balancing that horrendous imbalance that A was responsible for, then you actually have to institute various programs designed to RE-balance B in such a manner that they are now given opportunities that they weren't given before; opportunities that A might not get...but that's only because A started off in a position of power and authority that B never had ever at all.
