        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No matter what side you fall on regarding guilt or innocence, these recent verdicts aren&#39;t about black or white. These recent verdicts are about the completely broken, fake Grand Jury process.</p>

<p>In order to believe the Grand Jury in both these cases are impartial, you have to believe that 14-25 supposedly &quot;random&quot; people agree with the DA 100% of the time. They never think the DA is wrong over a 1-2 YEAR period. That is, until a cop is involved. Then, suddenly these same 14-25 people who have agreed with the DA EVERY SINGLE TIME suddenly disagree with that same DA.</p>

<p>Who in their right mind thinks that is remotely possible all over the country? 100% indictment rate for citizens, 0% indictment rate for police officers?</p>

<p>This clearly shows just how corrupt the Grand Jury process is, and just how controlled the citizens are by our police state.</p>

<p>The scary thing about it is, the people who are on the grand jury dont want to be there. &quot;Just do whatever, I want to go home.&quot;</p>

<p>That happened. In a grand jury I served on. Luckily, I was able to convince my grand jury that those cases are real, they mattered. </p>

<p>Scared the piss out of me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty much true for every jury.  Being a juror is a pain in the ass.  it&#39;s often dull, uncomfortable and stressful.  Heck, it&#39;s dull, uncomfortable and stressful for me and I&#39;m at the plaintiff&#39;s table.  </p>

<p>For the most part, the juries I&#39;ve seen (not grand juries, we use the preliminary hearing system here and if you think grand juries are effed up, you should sit in on a prelim sometime) have been attentive for the most part and took their instructions and their job as jurors very seriously and professionally.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, there should be a separate, independent panel with a special prosecutor for cases involving police officers.</p>

<p>Of course, neither grand jury decision negates the families&#39; ability to bring civil suits, which is where the real ju$tice is.</p>

an effort to revive the person.  Simple CPR would change the whole outcome yet nobody seems to be discussing that. It should be a mandatory policy that to carry a gun you must be trained in basic life support and are required to employ it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, its a prosecuters job to present the case as a crime or not. When the prosecuter works for the same local/state government as the offending officer, 10/10 they will present the case as self defense to save thier butt&#39;s and the butt&#39;s of the department involved. Its not the grand jury thats the problem, there is a need for third party arbitration and presentation of the incident instead of the party investigation and &quot;prosecuting&quot; itself </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude the rabbit hole goes way deeper than that, you are just skimming the surface.</p>

<p>We dont live in a country with constitutional protections. We are all slaves to government that declared military rule back in 1866 when 9 states walked out of congress. After that the Command and Chief (the president) declared martial law and brought all states under military rule. We still live in that world today.</p>

<p>All courts are statue courts, brought under authority of government with the commander and chief at the helm. They can ignore or change any laws at any time if its in the interests of whats called public policy. (necessity) to keep public order. Look it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way I heard it put, actually somewhere here on reddit, was as such:</p>

<p>The grand jury only indicts based off evidence. If enough evidence is apparent to warrant a criminal trial, then they will indict, otherwise they don&#39;t. Most citizens in positions that go before a grand jury are indicted because there is less of a burden on them to prove there was particular intent. Point is, the state has the monopoly on the use of force. As such, they (prosecutors) MUST make the case show the officer acted with intent to reach the outcome, and most likely, that the outcome was somewhat premeditated. The other issue is more systemic and would be harder to eradicate as its more on who feeds who. The prosecutor likely would have been given evidence from the very LEO he&#39;s supposed to be trying to get indicted. If that&#39;s the case, that same prosecutor would (and likely should) have records checked for anything by that LEO in case there were other issues, in the case of an indictment. If there was any question and those prior cases were thrown out, then that prosecutor now loses stats which can negatively affect their career and the office they work for.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t justify it, doesn&#39;t make it right, but it does make <em>sense</em> as to why it happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I agree. Thats just what was explained that made some more sense of it. But one incident we have no video so thats sort of understandable. The other we do....</p>
