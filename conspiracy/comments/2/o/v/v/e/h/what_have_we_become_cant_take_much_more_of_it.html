        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>this world is so fucked up.
the level of stupidity in the world is just... there are no words for it.
I can&#39;t stand living in this society much longer.
its torture watching all of the morons of this planet throw shit at each other.
I imagine a higher being watching us from above sees us as disgusting beasts.
Is it any wonder they never bother to interact with us?</p>

<p>we are worse than any other plant or animal on this planet.
At least other animals live in harmony with their environment. they are at peace
and live quietly and fairly.</p>

<p>But us. jesus christ.
we just destroy everything in our path. ourselves. the environment. the planet.
what are we doing? really.
where are we trying to get to?</p>

<p>striving for the next gadget. hoarding material goods.
I watched an apple iphone commercial on tv last night and I almost vomited in disgust.
what the fuck is this shit?
with the holiday season upon us, we are even worse than usual.
its the tradition we have of shopping and gifting random trash merchandise from china that adds nothing to our lives.
trample each other to death at walmart so we can have another tv.</p>

<p>Its the more, more, more mentality, more of everything. give it to MEEEEEEE!</p>

<p>my smart phone has 10,000 apps! but I need more!
My Tv has 500 channels! more please.</p>

<p>the grocery store has an entire isle of potato chips with shelves stacked above my head, and an entire isle of soda.
But we need more options and more choices.</p>

<p>people argue and bicker over pointless shit. read this conspiracy thread for example.
front page top post is another racial tension sensationalist bullshit.
divide and conquer. just what they want.</p>

<p>the great conspiracy is how stupid we all act together.</p>

<p>Its all so pathetic and sad that all you can do is laugh about it.</p>

Everyone is only out for themselves. I am considering being a Hobo hopping trains. I really want to contribute to something good but I seem to have no idea where to look for an good organization that pays a living wage? Any ideas?

    <div class="md"><p>I did take a break from the news stuff. In fact i cant stand watching the news or reading the paper anymore. its all so fake and deceitful. the newscasters are so phony and full of shit. they talk and act like fucking robots. and and the papers no better.
every news outlet reports the same stories.
Problem is its not just the news that&#39;s the problem. its the people all around you everywhere.  everyone is so fake and self absorbed.
Its like we all lost our way a long time ago. been drifting in haze of physical and psychological distractions. and we&#39;ve been heading into disaster, now about to reach its destination.
the only good thing is that we can rebuild something new and better from this pile of burning shit we&#39;ve created.</p>

All these years they&#39;ve been working hard to get ahead and to find out the government doesn&#39;t have their best interest in mind is too much. They won&#39;t look even if they can see through the cracks because it&#39;s too much to bear. But most do not even notice.

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t responded to a comment concerning religion in a while strictly because I am tired of trying to get people to see it my way and I their way. However, your comment bothered me. If the God that <a href="/u/SquareHimself">/u/SquareHimself</a> is referring to is the one that I am thinking of, the God from the Bible, then this God is not everything that the human mind wants. In fact, a lot of people choose not to believe in this God because they do not want to have moral &quot;guidelines.&quot;</p>

<p>I always wondered, just because evidence is lacking, does it mean nothing is there? Science is constantly making/tweaking discoveries. Sure, you can choose to have science approve of what you believe but if you do that, I wouldn&#39;t consider it fair for you to &#39;push&#39; your beliefs on others.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying people should believe whatever they want to believe, what I am saying is that I feel that we should be a bit more tolerant and respectful. <em>Whether you agree or not is up to you.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You fundamentally misunderstood. </p>

<p>While everyone is free to believe what they want to believe, I was correcting SquareHimself on his own purported beliefs, as prescribed by the religion most frequently referring to the creation mythos as the property of one God. </p>

<p>Christianity itself points out clear as day that it&#39;s God is in all of Creation, inside of you and me and rocks and trees. God is literally everything, there is no separate sentient entity. Therefore, you are just as much God as he is and as I am. WE are all God. The respect that is given to the Biblical entity YHWY is misplaced, as it should be respect for ALL OF GOD&#39;S CREATION. Including each and every other human being. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll forgive me, but perversions of religion to cover for man&#39;s faults (and the now endemic systems of control that directly disrespect everything Christianity claims to stand for) is far more offensive in time, space, and souls than any singular post I could make on a website. And the Unknowing like SquareHimself propagate the damage done in His name by going about their life co-signing to the FARCE they were sold by a business called The Church. </p>

<p>Whether you agree or not is up to you, but I remain spiritual. Even and especially in the face of dogmatic brainwashing and propaganda propulsion. That is what &quot;Christ Consciousness&quot; directs us all to do. </p>

Sometimes i wonder weather those in power know the world id coming to end or some shit and thats why they dont give a shit about us or the environment </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brother. There is something odd here you&#39;ve noticed.
We are in a school, prison, farm of some sort. You&#39;re not alone. Those who seem to begin to figure it out seem to become more reclusive. More pieces fit the puzzle. You will also. Allow time and fate to do what must be done.  </p>

<p>Best wishes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you. Seriously, I&#39;m so disillusioned that I sometimes struggle to function on a daily basis.<br/>
All I see is lies and corruption. Meritocracy? Don&#39;t make me laugh.<br/>
And worst of all, we seem to moving away from justice and equality. Which is surprising seeing how decrepit we are/have been.     </p>

<p>The only solace I take is that historically, people have always felt like this. Every generation thinks that things have never been worse. But on the whole humans live better lives now than ever before.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing to do to help people. Seek right knowledge and truth. The level of consciousness the general public possesses  is low. Millions still watch the tel-lie-vision. Millions are dosed with fluoride on a daily basis. There are people who are so deeply entrenched inside the mindset of this system. This is Satan&#39;s system, how? Do your research and you will know. We are at a very precarious position in our timeline. Many <em>will</em> die, there is no question about that. It is already happening before our very eyes however, no one will notice until its happening to <em>them</em>! &quot;My people perish for the lack of knowledge.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our society is what happens when you abandon morality, civility, honesty, and common decency in favor of excess, pornography, violence, and corruption.</p>

<p>We need a return to religion, so that we have a moral code to live by. Some of you don&#39;t like to hear this? Fine. It&#39;s still the way it is.</p>

<p>If there isn&#39;t a moral revolution and a return to some renovated form of Christianity, then Islam will take over. What we have now is a moral vacuum. A vacuum demands to be filled.</p>

<p>Morality isn&#39;t something a society can arbitrarily cast aside. It is a necessary part of a healthy society. A formal, organized religion provides a moral structure for a society. That&#39;s why there is no human society without its religion.</p>

<p>I agree that at present Christianity has become inflexible and hidebound in its teachings, but there have been hundreds of different Christian schools and sects and fraternities over the course of the last two thousand years. Christianity is adaptable. It needs to be transformed into something the average modern person in the West can embrace.</p>

<p>Talk about abandoning all religions is futile and silly. It is never going to happen. If Christianity is destroyed, Islam will take its place. Think about that, all you who are so keen to see Christianity done away with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did take a break from the news stuff. In fact i cant stand watching the news or reading the paper anymore. its all so fake and deceitful. the newscasters are so phony and full of shit. they talk and act like fucking robots. and and the papers no better.
every news outlet reports the same stories.
Problem is its not just the news that&#39;s the problem. its the people all around you everywhere.  everyone is so fake and self absorbed.
Its like we all lost our way a long time ago. been drifting in haze of physical and psychological distractions. and we&#39;ve been heading into disaster, now about to reach its destination.
the only good thing is that we can rebuild something new and better from this pile of burning shit we&#39;ve created.</p>
