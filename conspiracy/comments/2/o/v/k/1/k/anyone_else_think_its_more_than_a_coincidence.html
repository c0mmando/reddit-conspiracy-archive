    <div class="md"><p>So the authorities didn&#39;t care about the hundreds of thousands of torrents for copyright infringing material but they&#39;ll take it down for one legal torrent?</p>

<p>That&#39;s more than a stretch.  Especially since there are many many trackers out there still up.  This has done nothing to reduce the availability of one torrent.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve raided the pirate bay how many times.  Without some evidence to the contrary I&#39;d say coincidence.</p>

I&#39;d guess you might argue that they wouldn&#39;t want to lose out on all that money; Yet once you realize that money is(these days at least) a means of control, that argument doesn&#39;t hold much weight.</p>

<p>edit: i do agree though, that tpb wasn&#39;t taken down for this single vid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>anything THAT open to the public that&#39;s illegal HAS to be a trap. Its like that group &quot;Anonymous&quot; don&#39;t you think its weird that it has NO structure? Its just a scapegoat name people use, it started off as a troll protest during Scientology raids online. Now its suddenly a &quot;hactivist&quot; group, its almost like anonymous is a way to boggle down the hackers INTO a group. Instead of a group of silent unnamed activist they threw in a hipster name and a VERY common mask people can buy at any costume shop or store, and now through that the police/government/etc have a pot to throw people in...or rather they threw THEMSELVES in it. You should read about the sales of the Guy Fawks mask after anonymous became public. I bet if you did research and found out the company that makes the mask and produces it probably has pretty shady connections </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anonymous died years ago. Now it&#39;s a bunch of activists posing for hacktivist who probably have never heard of a IRC board before. Anyone who believes Anonymous is still around probably doesn&#39;t know what Anonymous was really about. Hacking and witch hunting. Those masks and quotes (or &quot;structure&quot;) where all a product of newfags trying to make a real movement. But what the public don&#39;t understand is Anonymous was suppose to have no icons (especially corporate trademarks) or statements like &quot;we are legion&quot;. Anonymous was designed to have no structure, no leadership, no icons. It was originally a suited guy with a question mark over his head, which evolved into a green suited man, which lead to some faggot photoshopping Guy Fawks mask over it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sick and tired of this new Anonymous, it has become everything hacktivist fought so hard against many years ago. Corporate dominance over the public. Today, like you mentioned, Anonymous is nothing more than a method for corporations to profit from and allows the Government to identify who&#39;s anti-establishment. All the real Anons were either arrested and restricted access to the Internet years ago, or simply moved to a different hacktivist group like lulsec. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anonymous is like being a hippy. </p>

<p>You knew you were part. You know how it was back then. You remember the LOIC, and you still have your favorite version backed up. You remember the brown box. You remember the operation chantology. </p>

<p>Nowadays, you look back, and you look at anonymous today. Sure, it has changed. It has become more open, more ambivalent. 
Todays anon is unable to code, does not have anythjing in particular against scientology, and mostly tries to be different. </p>

<p>But now, the guys from back then are grown up. Some have kids, all have jobs, and we can no longer spend all night on irc. But never assume that the spirit is dead. 
never assume that there are no longer the oldfags out there, who would know your pain, and would host your files, simply based on the promise of good pics, and the knowledge that you were like them. </p>

<p>You can kill anonymous with newfags... But you can&#39;t kill the spirit of anonymous. Because the spirit is immortal. It infects old and young alike, and it never lets them go. 
And yes, even though I dread it, spirits are bullet proof. </p>

<p>To end this with a quote that is only slightly changed.... ( I believe Hunter would look favorably on this...)</p>

<p>“It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era — the kind of peak that never comes again. 
(Anonymous) in the early days was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run... but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the net. Whatever it meant...</p>

<p>There was madness in any direction, at any hour. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning...</p>

<p>And that, I think, was the handle — that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn&#39;t need that. Our energy would simply PREVAIL. There was no point in fighting — on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave...</p>

<p>So now, less than six years later, you can go up on a silent channel at night and look towards IRC and 4-chan... and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark — that place where the wave finally broke, and rolled back.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well lets start with how torrent sites work, nothing on The Pirate Bay is actually from The Pirate Bay, its all peer-to-peer meaning that others provide the content and Torrent sites are just the network that people use to get it from one another. Back before torrent sites were common place this was a great thing because everybody was file sharing with one another and groups like the RIAA were not hip to that type of medium of piracy. Now this isn&#39;t the first time The Pirate Bay got shut down, and its probably one of the most popular torrent sites out there so don&#39;t you think its funny that it would keep its original name and site after being found out once already? It doesn&#39;t make sense, that would be like if a drug dealer kept the SAME stash spot after the spot got raided once or twice already. The government has a tight lock on sites like that and USE all the people downloading as ways to catch the offenders. Now average downloaders are not going to be arrested or fined, it would take forever. So what they do is they look at WHERE the downloads are coming from, lets look at the Silk Road now, Silk Road is a well known &quot;deep web&quot; site where folks can buy all kinds of drugs in various quantities. How is it STILL active after being busted and its not like its a secret site, its for sure a trap. Whats the best way to catch drug dealers? Provide the drugs and they will make their way to the people. </p>

<p>I think they&#39;re trying to make a stand. They have their own political party as well. They want to make a positive change. Just my opinion of course.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what they do is they look at WHERE the downloads are coming from</p>

<p>How does that help them? The downloads are coming from everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems you have more questions than answers by your response. To clarify a few things. In your stash analogy, TPB has moved its servers or &quot;stash&quot; country to country for a long while. Peter sunde is an actual activist of the pirate party. The laws that &quot;prevent&quot; piracy were written by people with the tech savvy of a 16th century pirate. The TPB is as much of a honeypot as your local postal service. Some one can send you herb or you could accidentally received it or even legally have the right to own it, either way, the USPS is not a trap and neither is TPB. Its just sadly losing a great battle to change the way we think of information. </p>

<p>The video is <a href="http://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/192366/We_Need_to_Talk_about_Sandy_Hook__Full_Video_in_Higher_Quality/">still easily available online</a>, it&#39;s not being suppressed. </p>

<p>Personally I wonder more if this is related to <a href="http://bgr.com/2014/12/05/sony-pictures-hack-passwords-and-ssns/">the recent Sony leak</a> where a lot of private information from Sony (including celebrity information) was put online. Sony has enough ties in Hollywood that they could have forced action from the Sw police. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally feel that piracy plays into the hands of tptb.  Let people &quot;rebel&quot; by &quot;stealing&quot; yet in doing so get them to consume the distraction.  I&#39;d guess you might argue that they wouldn&#39;t want to lose out on all that money; Yet once you realize that money is(these days at least) a means of control, that argument doesn&#39;t hold much weight.</p>

<p>edit: i do agree though, that tpb wasn&#39;t taken down for this single vid.</p>
