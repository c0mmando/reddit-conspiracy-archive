    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for giving a reasonable response. I read that with an open mind but it did not resonate with me. I am on the right track for me and my family. I bought a house and started fixing it up before I woke up. I am still doing that. It may be in vein but I am not ready to walk away from that just yet. </p>

<p>I do everything the best I can now but it does not sustain a working class guy with a family and a mortgage. Not to mention he is talking about being a blogger! He isn&#39;t talking about hunting or homesteading for survival!</p>

<p>Can I ask what you do for a living?</p>

<p>I think we are on different paths and I am OK with that. May the odds be forever in your favor!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me restate what might be a common occurrence when the rebellion really kicks into gear:</p>

<p>The biggest problem here.</p>

<p>Step one, states will put forth their police forces and militarize them towards said mob of the entire population of towns that begin the process of taking back america.</p>

<p>Step two, attempt to tear gas and/or shoot non-lethally where applicable at angry mob until they call it a night because they&#39;ve been too scared to challenge the police.</p>

<p>Step three, repeat until they all stop and go back to their legal slavery lives. As seen in ferguson.</p>

<p>Or.</p>

<p>Step two, the mob of the entire town fights back without hesitation with whatever force is required. The national guard is now called in.</p>

<p>This can go two ways. One, the crowd is shot at and dispersed and will not reform because of all the deaths.</p>

<p>Or two, they fight at the national guard and/or enough members decide the enemy is the state, finally, and join the cause. At some point the military will split off between those who believe and those do not, which will likely cause a giant civil war.</p>

<p>And it will begin like this all across america, in the best case scenario. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d disagree. Non violence creates a passive acceptance only to fool those into believing they have obtained victory. The civil rights movement is a prime example. I would argue that violence is the answer but to a degree. Throwing molotov cocktails at a fence of police trying to control the crowd is not the answer. &quot;Storming the bastille&quot; is the answer. Don&#39;t be a rebel, be a revolutionary. Perspective is 90% of the game. The civil rights movement was a compromise between those affected and those affecting. The problem with this is that those affecting still get what they wanted out of a compromise and left those affected in a worse situation than they were (except for the fact they are accepted by the masses now)</p>

<p>Campaign finance reform? Everybody wants it - but nobody wants to out a solution that we can all agree on (and you know if Washington gets to make the solution it will be wrought with loopholes).</p>

<p>Police state? Same comment.</p>

<p>Drone striking sovereign nations with a 4% kill rate? Same comment.</p>

<p>A corrupt private organization creating the currency of this country, constantly manipulating and manufacturing crises to further extract resources from the people? Same comment.</p>

<p>An economy built on war, which means degrading, destroying, and killing people to survive? Same comment.</p>

<p>Endless snooping/spying on people (both in the Homeland™ and abroad)? Same comment.</p>

<p>An overreaching federal government into people&#39;s private lives (in jail for smoking plant? Come on now...)? Same comment.</p>

<p>If only there was a political party that holds these values as important, instead of decisive stances on abortion, gay rights, gun control, etc, I am willing to bet <strong>far more people would be into it than you realize</strong>, which is by design, of course. The false right/left red/blue paradigm is a control mechanism, and you all fucking know it if you&#39;ve read this far.</p>

<p>There are far more disaffected, middle-aged people than you realize. You are told to just &#39;wait until the Boomers die off, then we&#39;ll have change!&#39; But this is a message from those who are in power <em>because of the boomers</em>, and are basically telling you to just wait. Are you sick of waiting?</p>

<p>How many if you here have problems with those issues above? They are not <em>partisan</em>, they are real issues that cannot be co-opted like the Tea Party was. Those issues aren&#39;t <em>wedges</em>, they are real problems that can have real solutions and can be used to unite us, not drive us further apart, and this fictitious political party starts as soon as You want it to.</p>

<p>Because I&#39;m fired up, I&#39;ll close with a fantastic speech performed by Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator in 1940:</p>

<p>The most effective way to take them down is to stop funding them.</p>

<p>If you fight them and you&#39;re paying them to fight you then you&#39;re just an idiot. Stop paying their taxes and stop using their money. With enough people doing that they won&#39;t even have the funding to do any violence in the first place.</p>

<p>Just stop funding them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s cheaper and less destructive.</p>

There&#39;s not much you can do. In addition, this hurts my community if done on a large scale.

    <div class="md"><p>Pay as few of their taxes as possible. Get onto alternative currencies.</p>

<p>Baby steps. I don&#39;t pay tribute [Federal Income Tax]. Is it the end of the world? No. But they don&#39;t get my money. When a stable alternative currency comes along I can use it and I won&#39;t be tied to their bullshit money system. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t do it all at once. You do it in steps.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to add that the government has no duty to protect you and will not protect you (Warren vs D.C. / Lozito vs. NYC). Every time you give them money you&#39;re giving an unaccountable group of violent people money to do something they will not do. The best thing is to deny them all support and contribute to groups that actually <em>will</em> hold to their promises.</p>

<p>Baby steps. You don&#39;t scale a mountain in a single bound.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A.) Only since earlier this year. I expect they&#39;ll turn their attention toward me now that they&#39;re doing this whole ObamaCare thing. Since I don&#39;t give them money and I have zero communication with them the only way they can impose their ObamaCare fine on me (I&#39;m too poor to afford ObamaCare ironically), they can only fine me. Which must happen through the tribute system [Federal Income Taxes]. </p>

<p>When wil they turn their evil gaze at me? I don&#39;t know. For now I&#39;m too poor for them to care about. I&#39;m too little for them to make a show trial out of me. So I slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>B.) If I get harassed I&#39;ll be putting a plan into action. I&#39;m slowly detailing the plan now so that if it does need to be initiated I can do so in an almost machine-like rapidity.</p>

<p>C.) I do not have a credit card. As soon as I can get off their money system I&#39;ll do so. I don&#39;t want their credit and I don&#39;t want their money. I&#39;d rather use a currency that isn&#39;t debt-based. A bank that doesn&#39;t use fractional reserve lending is a bank I&#39;d support.</p>

<p>Literally the only reason we&#39;re locking into the USD right now is because they violently impose their tribute system on us [Federal Income Taxes] and we can only pay tribute in USD. Once you no longer pay tribute there&#39;s no need for their bullshit money.</p>

<p>D.) Non-compliance on all levels is the only thing that can stop them.</p>

<p>Just refuse to play their godamn games.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop eating big macs, squat, stop working in a situation where you&#39;re even getting a w2 unless the job is worth more than contributing to the beast, be ready to go hungry and/or die. It requires a bleak and intense resolve that few of us can claim to have; I certainly don&#39;t yet despite fancying myself ahead of the wake-up curve. I suspect that as we&#39;re pushed over the edge more often as time goes by, those that don&#39;t actually drown or fight each other for the scraps can help form a net for the newer members of the down-and-outery, and make it easier for people to make that choice in the future.</p>

<p>This is a lot easier to do once we&#39;re going hungry and dying anyway and driven to being critical of the whole thing, which still isn&#39;t the case for the majority of us and part of why we&#39;re not seeing much coherent conversation between the current movements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you actually can stop your employer from taking your taxes out. All they&#39;re doing is an estimation anyway, and if you get a &quot;refund&quot; at the end of the year, that just means that your employer took out more than you &quot;owed&quot; (see also: you allowed to be stolen) for that year.</p>

<p>Not a lot of people know this, but you can claim as many exemptions as you want with your employer, to the point where you get your entire income on each check without being taxed. It&#39;s the exemptions that you file when you file your taxes each your that have to be accurate. </p>

<p>I claim 3 right now (single non-homeowning male) and it gets me to where I basically break even each tax season. I&#39;d rather not get a return than loan the scumbag goverment my money for free. The year prior I had claimed 4 and ended up owing a little bit of money.</p>

<p>In theory, if you wanted to stop funding them (at least through income tax) you can claim however many exemptions you need to get your full check each week, and then not pay your income tax at the end of the year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tipping point isn&#39;t a set thing.  It will happen naturally.</p>

<p>The only thing keeping the US afloat right now is the fact that, for most Americans, there&#39;s still food on the table.  When these issues begin affecting the majority of people&#39;s daily life to a degree they can&#39;t ignore any more, then you&#39;ll start seeing real civil unrest.</p>

<p>Many of us are well aware of the problem and we can see it coming down the track, but most people will deny it&#39;s existence until it&#39;s right upon them.  It&#39;s the fault of the human mind.  </p>

<p>Stay in the short term and treat the symptom not the root.  </p>

<p>If there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s going to destroy humankind, it&#39;s that mentality.  It&#39;s THE most dangerous thing about us and If we&#39;re going to survive the next 200 years, that mentality is the one that has to change.</p>
