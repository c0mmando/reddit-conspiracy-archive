       <p>
        Now in case you missed it, yet another bankster has been suicided.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms. Melissa Millan, 54, described as being a “senior vice-president at Mass Mutual” and a manager with Citigroup was found stabbed to death on a popular jogging trail near her home. Sadly, Ms. Millan was also a mother, and our hearts and prayers go out to her family at this time at the loss of their loved one in such a cruel and despicable manner:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now, if one scrolls down a bit in this profile, one comes across this notation:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “Sr. Vice President
      </p>
      <p>
       MassMutual Insurance
      </p>
      <p>
       2006 – Present (8 years)
      </p>
      <p>
       General management of BOLI, Executive Group Life, Worksite DI businesses, and expansion into worksite and voluntary benefits market.” (Bold and italicized emphasis added)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is extremely intriguing, for as many who have been tracking the banker suicide stories have noted, many of the victims had BOLI policies.
       </p>
       <p>
        BOLI, you’ll recall, are “Bank-Owned Life Insurance” policies, payable to the bank if the person on whom the policy is issued suddenly decides to take walks off of tall bank buildings or to be stabbed to death on a jogging path.
       </p>
       <p>
        In other words, Ms. Millan was heavily involved in an aspect of the murky business of insurance and banking that would, possibly, have allowed her to “see” a pattern in the banker suicides and deaths that we do not see.
       </p>
       <p>
        More importantly, her sad murder is corroboration that there is indeed something to BOLI aspect of the story. Indeed, one my view it as the first clear indicator of something to the insurance angle. But what might it be?
       </p>
       <p>
        Here comes the high octane speculation of the day. Thus far the BOLI angle has been advanced by some to argue that these victims are being offed to cash in on their BOLI policies to prop up failing banks.
       </p>
       <p>
        But this angle has never seemed convincing to me, because there are simply too few banker deaths for such an explanation to make sense, even if those BOLI policies are for substantial amounts of money. The numbers, in short, do not seem to add up to be adequate for this explanation to make sense.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, as noted above, we now have a clear murder of someone involved with that end of the banking business, dealing explicitly with BOLI policies.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this juncture, let us factor in the deaths of some other bankers, among whom were some involved in FOREX (foreign exchange, i.e., currency and securities exchange), and, in the case of non-banker mortgage title business owner Richard Talley, someone involved in mortgage title investigation and clearing.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, assuming all these deaths to be related, what emerges from this?
       </p>
       <p>
        In each of these cases, the deaths were of people who might have been in a position to see patterns (or, alternatively, of people whom someone else suspected of having seen a pattern).
       </p>
       <p>
        What connects BOLI (insurance), FOREX, and mortgages? If you’ve been following Catherine Austin Fitts’ hypotheses and her story of massive mortgage fraud in HUD, or following my hypothesis of a hidden postwar system of finance, FOREX, insurance, and mortgage fraud and manipulation are the precise areas at which that hidden system interfaces with the public one.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of these would also have been familiar with computerized transactions and high-frequency trading, and possibly with the opportunities these afforded for further manipulation and harvesting of money by that system.
       </p>
       <p>
        So again, to my mind, the possibility remains open that whoever is committing these murders, they might not be coming, ultimately, from inside the banking and finance community, but rather, from inside the the various national security apparatuses behind the modern western system of international finance.

       Bank Shoguns like those at Santander, N.A. need to be imprisoned and charged, and banned from ever doing business anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that they can play the rigged housing crisis in Italy and Spain and then leave the wreckage to come buy out banks like Sovereign in US or others in the UK reeks of criminal negligence, and fraud on so many levels..
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't think its gonna repeat 08 on the CORPORATE level, we KNOW. Since we also know those who engineered this fallout made a killing and stand to make another, it's time to show them what we are made of. Besides, we also know one thing: The FED and QE Printing that was endless needs to recoup its losses or USA will know Bankruptcy and then some. The only way to accomplish this is to put a lot of very rich people behind very thick bars.

       One guy cuts his own throat. Another commits "suicide" by shooting himself in the head...
       <strong>
        twice
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, someone who's in a position to see the patterns is stabbed on a jogging trail? It's an interesting angle, but perhaps too obvious. Consider that an investigative team could easily take a look at the same data that she had access too.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was some kind of outstanding pattern, they should be able to spot it in no time. On the other hand, if her death is "found to be a random act of violence" no such investigation will ever take place.

       This one was my favorite.  When I first saw that posted, I thought that it had to be satire.  Nope.  They really deemed it a suicide.  By nail.  8 nails actually.  Ridiculous.

       Seems like common sense to me.  Claimed conspiracy requiring cooperation and continued silence of thousands of people, with no solid evidence given ?  Probably nonsense.  Suicidal guy chooses a stupid and fairly ineffective way of killing himself with nearest tool to hand ?  Seems plausible.

       That was wartime, with the US people united about who the enemy was.  And the Russians knew all the details about the program, had all the secrets, all along.  If they'd wanted to, they could have exposed it, with convincing evidence, at any time.  The thousands of people in the US program were NOT able/willing to keep silent; half a dozen of them betrayed it to a foreign country.

       Nice non-sequitur. Thousands did keep silent as you just admitted, a couple of them without complete knowledge of the entire project due to compartmentalization had been able to only leak bits of info that had an unknown effect on the Soviet nuclear weapons program.

       I don't know about EIGHT nails in particular, but I bet someone else has killed themselves, deliberately or accidentally, with a nail-gun.  It's a reasonably dangerous and powerful tool.  Sure, it's possible it wasn't a suicide.  Do you suppose that occurred to the authorities ?  That maybe they looked for evidence of murder, checked that angle of wounds and organs hit and amount of bleeding was consistent with a suicide ?  Perhaps it's more likely that the police and coroner got it right, than that there was some conspiracy ?  A conspiracy for which you are providing NO evidence, just speculation ?

       Because "the authorities" have certainly never withheld, ignored, and/or deliberately suppressed evidence in cases like this before...
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it's possible that it was a suicide but I no longer take the MSM at its word and suicide by nail gun is, quite frankly, a pretty absurd explanation to just believe at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any evidence that something other than suicide was ever even considered? To my knowledge there haven't been any details made available about the crime scene or the wounds themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say I'm providing no evidence and just speculating, and I am, but that's exactly what "the authorities" did as well in every article I've read on the subject.  There is no indication that the possibility of murder was ever investigated.

       The authorities didn't tell you/us the details of their investigation.  Routinely, when there's a death, they consider all of the main possibilities: murder, suicide, accident.  You are giving innuendo that maybe they didn't consider murder in this case.  I think the burden is on you to show evidence of that, or evidence of murder.

       It's absolutely routine that murder, suicide, accident are considered when there's an unattended or suspicious death.  To suggest that they skipped consideration of "murder", without ANY evidence to support that suggestion, is innuendo.

       You get to a certain level of the western banking and financial system and you find almost systemic levels of fraud and criminality. It's no surprise they are having this happen because this is basically a big organized crime 'family'. If you want to know more about it read/listen to 'Catherine Austin Fitts'(former Secretary of HUD under Bush Sr. and a Wall Street money manager), or read the book 'Black Money' - that will give you a good idea of how fucked up this system currently is.

       Well even knowing what I know with my parents owning a firm is enough to make me sick at even the best of times..
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year I keenly remember vomiting in the back room toilet because I realized how much the current economic climate mirrors the housing crisis on a corporate level. Not the firm's fault but we are always the first to know and the first to lose our jobs. Still trying to get back into work and I really need to be around people who silently understand why we feel this way.

       I've seen no evidence that banker murder, accident, suicide rates are anything out of the ordinary, atypical for people of that age or demographic.  Murders, suicides, accidents happen all the time, to people of all occupations and ranks.  I think these conspiracy stories are just picking anecdotes, without putting them in context.  How many people worldwide work in banking/investing/finance, how many are "high-level", what is the murder/suicide/accident rate among them, what is corresponding rate for non-bankers/financiers of same age, same countries, etc ?  Until you run some numbers and show a difference, I think these stories are unsupported alarmism.

       My money is that the government is involved. They are playing everything so well. Let these bankers run wild by committing crimes but at the same time use that money to leverage their banks and investments.  At the same time, government says and does nothing for an extended time such as decades. Then when they have seen that these bankers put their companies in a great position, they go in, kill some of top people and take over a perfectly working scam that's self sufficient.

       Just a wild theory.

       Another thing that's so stunning about these deaths and "suicides" is how few of them are solved. Obviously in cases ruled suicide there isn't going to be a formal investigation, but I haven't read about any of the murders being solved. Nor have I heard about suicide notes or any other indication that these people were going to end their lives. Can anyone enlighten me on this?
