<p>If the voters are not given the truth about the activities of their government and are intentionally deceived, doesn&#39;t that make the voters rigged and completely undermines the idea of a democracy?  If the voters can&#39;t make informed decisions because of intentional deception, then aren&#39;t we left with a tyranny masquerading as a democracy?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democracy... while it lasts is more bloody than either aristocracy or monarchy. Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There is never a democracy that did not commit suicide.
John Adams</p>

<p>Dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme liberty.
Plato</p>

<p>Democracy must be something more than two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.
James Bovard</p>

<p>We should all remember Democracy is bad, it is mob rule, where as a republic protects the minority. We are a republic! Democracy was never the intention of the founders. They knew it was cancer. Looks good on paper just like socialism, but never works or lasts long. We must own property, property=rights</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialistic democracy thrives in Scandinavia, which for many people seem like the ideal form of government. Democracy works, it&#39;s just slow and not ruled by the people, as much as the people think it is. But it works. Taxes don&#39;t fund private interests. Political campaigns are funded by the parties and members of the parties hosting them. Sure, the bigger wallet is an asset, but this is close to being fair. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russ, considering your experience in tracking elements of the Deep State, such as possible routes of funding, could you explain a little bit about the role of the Exchange Stabilization Fund out of the Treasury, which at least one researcher has claimed,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;controls the New York Fed, runs the CIA&#39;s black budget, and is the architect of the world&#39;s monetary system (IMF, World Bank, etc). ESF financing (through the OSS and then the CIA) built up the worldwide propaganda network which has so badly distorted history today (including erasing awareness of its existence from popular consciousness). It has been directly involved in virtually every major US fraud/scandal since its creation in 1934: the London gold pool, the Kennedy assassinations, Iran-Contra, CIA drug trafficking, HIV, and worse... &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on the role of these types of private financial policy boards in the functioning of a Deep State. Finally, if you can touch on any items regarding the funding of ISIS in relation to the Rat Line claims of Hersh, or how a secret space program might be funded outside of the public record, I&#39;d be especially appreciative. </p>

<p>Thank you for your time today, and for your constant great work. By the way, the new daily newsletter format is fantastic. Kudos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whew! My experience is that things aren&#39;t so neat, so i tend to be wary of pat explanations. No question, though, that entities where the wealthy and powerful consort are logical places to reach consensus on things. Nonetheless, these people also plot against each other, fall out of agreement, sue one another. That is what makes serious investigative work much harder than theorizing.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks again for indulging me. </p>

<p>I would like to see developed a list of examples of how such funding has been done in the past, or some kind of communicable model of how front companies funnel money from multiple sources, conceal it, put it to work, and prevent citizens from becoming aware of its absence from public records. I&#39;m thinking of something along the lines of a teaching aid, that would help people learn how to think about such mechanisms.</p>

<p>I understand the difficulty in describing how these things operate, and how much time is required investigating them. I only hope to be able to improve my ability to not only consider such information, but to share it with my peers, and those that would challenge my claims, or otherwise conceal such information.</p>

They would just be marginalized. However, I do know that the Kennedy clan is as aware as some members of the public of the facts on the ground, and appreciative of those who continue to carry the torch for full disclosure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you know, my middle name is &quot;agnostic.&quot; well, not literally. Point is, i try and take a scientific approach, but do not mistake that with trusting what others purport to be their science. I have seen the accounts by those who heard bombs, and seen the video of what looks like explosions. I cannot claim to know what they mean, but surely worth more research. Re the 28 pages blacked out of the report....no idea how detailed their discussion of the Saudi connection (which seems to be the thrust)--likely not super shocking, but also probably useful enough that the government doesnt want us to have it. I&#39;d bet incremental acknowledgment that something seemed fishy even to the committee.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As many of you know, I was standing in front of Building Seven when it collapsed. Looked to me and everyone standing nearby like there was no way an ordinary building fire could take a building down so neatly and quickly. Also, at WhoWhatWhy we&#39;ve investigated connections between the alleged hijackers and the Saudi royal family that is documented even in the FBI&#39;s own files <a href="http://whowhatwhy.com/2011/09/22/saudi-royal-ties-to-911-hijackers-via-florida-saudi-family-0/">http://whowhatwhy.com/2011/09/22/saudi-royal-ties-to-911-hijackers-via-florida-saudi-family-0/</a> . So I would say that we definitely do not have the full or even true story of what happened and why. I am an investigator, however, and I am equally uncomfortable with the dogmatic on both sides of the equation. I hope that we will be in a position to selectively drill down as we find new pieces worth exploring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi.  I loved Family of Secrets.  In it you mention a certain hesitancy from your colleagues about your tackling certain aspects of the JFK assassination.  Do you think it has closed doors for you in the largest publications and if so, permanently?  Any good examples of how it has or have you just gravitated away from those type of jobs?</p>

<p>Last thing.  It was you wrote of the exchange between LBJ and a Senator (Brown?) regarding LBJ&#39;s attempts to get Warren to head the Commission, right?  The exchange seems to indicate the blackmailing of Warren.  Any inkling of what &quot;that incident in Mexico&quot; might have been?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should tell you that prior to becoming fascinated with the question of George HW Bush and his whereabouts on 11/22, i myself had no particular opinions on the JFK hit. Most journalists are like that--and they&#39;re not necessarily well informed or well read on the topic. We are all victims of the dominant memes in the public forums. So anyone who has not researched the topic considers those who dont buy the lone nut story as themselves problematical. That means that when i started researching JFK&#39;s death i was knowingly opening myself up to suspicion and even blackballing. At this point, I dont care anymore--with the books and with WhoWhatWhy we are creating our own media environment for the truth, and trying to help educate, gently, those for whom all of this is a shock. </p>

<p>The exchange you speak of was between LBJ &amp; Senator Russell. I&#39;ve posted some links to the audio recordings elsewhere in this thread, along with a lengthy comment. The related audio recording between Hoover &amp; LBJ speaks even more to your question and is definitely worth a listen. </p>

<p>What&#39;s your opinion of the concept of a &quot;breakaway&quot; civilization? Could there be another layer &quot;beyond&quot; the Deep State?</p>

<p>Is it possible a portion of humanity has been so separated by technology (and/or space) that this notion of a Deep State was established as an interface between the breakaway civilization and the rest us? </p>

<p>Do you think those in the Deep State have access to exotic technology?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with this issue is that I am very very attuned to propaganda of all types, and the language I hear criticizing the Fed all sounds so similar I have to conclude that most people are mouthing it based on books, blogs, and so forth putting forth a viewpoint rather than having any kind of profound grasp of it themselves. The propaganda divide paradoxically has the same kinds of things going on on &quot;both sides&quot; -- the only real advocates for the truth are the fundamentally agnostic.

<p>2)  Can you provide clarification regarding the tape of Lyndon Johnson talking about blackmailing Earl Warren?  Many have claimed that the blackmailing was not, in fact, over his initial refusal to head the Warren commission,   </p>

<p>3)  From your perspective, how prolific are CIA disinformation agents in journalism (both print and screen)?  Also, do you have any stories about doing research and finding out about someone feeding you false information purposefully?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I am delighted to be here and am also glad to know that there are so many people interested in the work I do. Onward....
1. We have a general problem in this country whereby the public largely doesnt know what is going on and largely doesnt care. We also have very controlled and controllable media. So it is hard to get revelations like this out, and even when they are, there is no guarantee people will take action--assuming of course they know what kind of action to take, and assuming they even believe they can have any impact 
2. I am of a mixed mind on what LBJ was talking about. He had a way of abruptly shifting from one topic to another without notice. I guess that for now I accept he probably was not blackmailing Warren on a private issue--and have made a small change in the latest printing of my paperback to make that point. But I remain open on the matter.
3. From Operation Mockingbird, we know the Agency had large numbers of assets in media. It&#39;s hard to know whether that program still exists in some form. However, I should say that most journalists understand the limits of what they can reasonably say and do and keep their job and their &quot;reputation&quot; == so it may not even be necessary to have such formal relationships. Re false info, I am often contacted by people offering such, though i suspect many are just reckless and dont check their own facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Can you provide clarification regarding the tape of Lyndon Johnson talking about blackmailing Earl Warren? Many have claimed that the blackmailing was not, in fact, over his initial refusal to head the Warren commission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recording of the conversation between LBJ and Senator Richard Russell that you&#39;re referring to was made on 11/29/63 and can be heard <a href="http://www.wyzant.com/resources/lessons/history/hpol/lbj/warren/russell2">here</a>. The relevant part is from 16min into the tape (lasting about 30sec) when LBJ tells the Senator how he convinced Warren to change his mind about serving on the proposed (cover-up) commission by explaining what &#39;Hoover&#39; had told him about &#39;<em>that little incident in Mexico City</em>&#39;...and how Kruschev might respond to the same info...that Castro had a hand in it.</p>

<p>Those back-to-back references to Hoover, Mexico City, Kruschev &amp; Castro are most certainly in relation to a call made earlier on the same day from Hoover to LBJ which can be heard <a href="http://www.wyzant.com/resources/lessons/history/hpol/lbj/warren/hoover2">here</a>. The relevant part starts at 3m into the tape. This is a fascinating (20min) recording for several reasons, not least of which has Hoover revealing to LBJ that they have a report (from an unnamed informant) of Oswald getting $5500.00 cash from some woman named Duran in the Cuban embassy in Mexico City. Hoover goes on to explain that there are conflicts as to the exact date of Oswald&#39;s visit, but informs LBJ that he intends to administer lie-detector tests to all and sundry...</p>

<p>(<em>which quickly led to another comical chat about lie detector tests, along with a load of other remarkable revelations from Hoover, including: 3 shots were fired [already proven by his team] in 3 seconds...and that the President would have been hit 3 times if Governor Connolly hadn&#39;t turned and &#39;</em><em>BLOCKED</em><em>&#39; the 2nd shot...and that the FBI and himself had 4 bulletproof cars, but the President&#39;s&#39; limo was not armored, and the missing bubble top wouldn&#39;t have stopped a bullet anyway because it was made of plastic, etc...absolutely incredible stuff! The whole weird / creepy audio tape is worthy of its own separate debate here</em>)</p>

<p>So, it appears that LBJ&#39;s talk with Russell was indeed in reference to Hoover&#39;s earlier disclosure regarding Oswald&#39;s alleged trip to the Cuban embassy in Mexico City. Further reading between the (sublime) lines, they all agree that the Mexico City / Cuba / Russia (dis)info could possibly start a world war, and thus the safer bet in EVERYBODY&#39;s best interest was to cover up the crime to the best of their abilities.</p>

<p>TL/DR...the CIA, Pentagon, SecretService &amp; LBJ set up JFK, the Mafia &amp; DPD took care of Oswald, and Hoover &amp; the Warren Commission covered it all up.   </p>

<hr/>

<p>Another senior intelligence official noted that oversight had deteriorated so much during his career that “I don’t even know what good oversight looks like anymore.”[12] Overseers agreed. One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight “horrible” and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that “somebody in Congress would have to die.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to follow-up on CoincidenceTheory&#39;s question.</p>

<p>There are quite a lot of people in the alt-stream and on r/conspiracy, that suspect Snowden is part of a limited hangout operation. Key to this is the media reception he&#39;s received, and the observation that his leaked documents have not revealed anything new so far. That is,  they offer new specifics about programs that were long assumed to be in effect by most knowledgeable computer security professionals, based on the reports of previous whistleblowers and knowledge of today&#39;s computing and data thoroughput capacities. I can&#39;t think of a single activity that hadn&#39;t already been known or suspected that the Snowden documents have revealed. 
The other reason generally cited is that Snowden has an inconsistent backstory, admits that he was employed by the CIA as an information exfiltrator, has written a few years ago something to the effect of &quot;whistleblowers should have their balls chopped off&quot;.</p>

<p>Do you think these concerns are unfounded?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your reponse, Russ.</p>

<p>So yes, the Snowden documents have caused quite a stir to action in the tech community. Tor is getting closer scrutiny, auditing efforts are underway to ensure the sanity of the tech we have at out disposal that defeats the panopticon.</p>

<p>However, I think the masses are unaware that technological, non-political solutions to avoid mass surveillance are already available. </p>

<p>I knew, or suspected with near certainly, about most of the things the Snowden docs revealed, as did most in the computing security and hacker communities. You&#39;re entirely correct that most people knew nothing of these things -- but now they do know, and I think they are of the opinion that it can&#39;t be helped.</p>

<p>It is up to each one of us to point people in the direction of actionable solutions. Most media reports talk about the problem, but offer no solutions. Knowing, but being powerless to prevent it only leads to chilling effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I wrote it. I stand behind it. And thank you for calling my accound &#39;interesting&#39;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way for me to convince you I&#39;m not some paid shill, since this is, what I suspect, you believe. Please correct me if I am mistaken.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not sure how compromised Tor is -- if at all. Right now, I tend to believe there are more active exploits in OpenSSL, the security library used by nearly all of the internet, than Tor. 
Yes, tor development is funded by The State, but it does not control the network. At worst, they host a majority of bandwidth for exit nodes -- which could indeed be a problem, but it&#39;s far more nuanced than &quot;tor is govt operated.&quot; as to what attacks and compromises it permits.</p>

<p>I&#39;d really like to dig into the details of why you&#39;re so certain Snowden is strictly limited hangout for the effects you&#39;ve stated above, and nothing else. You&#39;re one of the most active people around here pushing the limited hangout interpretation. Yet you&#39;ve been pretty dismissive of my (moderately detailed) comments.</p>

<p>I guess if you think I&#39;m Just Some Shill, there&#39;s no way to engage in a discussion with you personally. Yet I think the alt community could benefit greatly from the adoption of the tools in the Strong Cryptography toolbox. </p>

<p>Tor is good for some things (user anonymity), bad for others(server anonymity). For technical reasons which I can personally explain, Tor cannot be a honeypot in the traditional sense of the word. 
Don&#39;t forget, there are other crypto tools out there. PGP is, pardon the pun, Pretty Good. Bitmessage is a new and interesting newcomer. And Bitcoin, of course, relies on the guarantees that only cryptographic certainties can provide.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you&#39;d like to continue this conversation.</p>

1. Do read Family of Secrets--i go into the roots of the family in the establishment, including Boston connections. No question but that network, through the private schools, secret societies, business connections and the like, made it possible to achieve all manner of success in government, much of it clandestinely.
2. I can&#39;t say for sure. I think the Brahmins are less of a factor than they once were, but we still see the old family&#39;s shaping policy through the Kerrys of the world. 
3. A lot of Old Money has paled by comparison with the newer fortunes, inheritances have been divided up, and so on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our goal is to provide the public with trustworthy information gathered by people who are curious, open-minded, and grounded in reality. Beyond that, we hope that providing that service will lead to a more informed and more involved public, and from there, that we&#39;ll see positive changes in our country and world. </p>

<p>Investigative journalism is so important--- but the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; where it is all about how many viewers and clicks, is anathema. We&#39;re determined to keep on expanding our investigative capacity, and where our resources are inadequate, at least to ASK investigative type questions.</p>

<p>Re the figures you mentioned, I dont exactly consider them role models. For more on Woodward, see Family of Secrets&#39; section on Watergate. There&#39;s more there than meets the eye. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for asking. Lots of ways to help.
-Let others know about our work. Use social media, especially, and your email lists, to spread the word.
-Tip us off if you get good leads on a story--where the subjects match our content. A lot of people write us about personal challenges they face, but we just can&#39;t do anything on that level. 
-Volunteer in your area of expertise. We certainly can use people with  specialized professional technical, legal, research, and other skills.
-Sign up to be a monthly donor. You&#39;d be amazed at how far your money goes with our very lean operation. And remember we&#39;re a nonprofit entirely dependent on the public. 
-give us feedback. Post thoughtful comments to our articles. And let us know via our contact page any feedback or ideas you have. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been of the mind that, even if JFK docs that are declassified have no smoking gun, there will be enough there to shed light on the story via linkage to other parts of the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we&#39;re making real progress. And I continue to work on the subject. btw, the seeming &quot;strangeness&quot; is, I think, because we&#39;re not used to looking at the system naked, with all the corruption that is baked in. That is, take a hard look at all kinds of institutions, and we see quasi-criminal activities. So it is not that everything is part of a &#39;conspiracy,&quot; but that self-dealing networks intertwine. </p>

<p>before today, did you know what &quot;limited hangout&quot; meant? </p>

<p><a href="/r/LimitedHangouts">/r/LimitedHangouts</a> </p>

<p>over 100 subscribers, people who question the official story on snowden</p>

<p>1- MSM gives him so much attention... nobody gets an interview with brian freakin williams if TPTB dont want the masses to know</p>

<p>2- told us nothing new. snowden confirmed what we knew 20 mins ago</p>

<p>3- his history, never seen his full record</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p>also, snowden may not know hes a lh, and greenwald may not know either</p>

<p><em>once CIA, always CIA</em></p>

<p><em>if its on the front page of TIME or the NYT.. it is not revolutionary</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? Nope, I dont buy it. If you had worked inside the media, you would know that it isnt actually totally resistant to reporting the truth. The problem is that it is a pack. It plays it safe. It waits until someone else is in the water before dipping its toe in. So with the likes of Snowden, or Assange, or what have you, some reporters are actually busy pitching their editors stories and hoping they get approved, and the editors are looking to see the way the winds are blowing. A most recent example of this is our WhoWhatWhy investigation of the official Boston Bombing story. Everyone in media pretty much ignored us. One gutsy MSM show in Boston had me on. Then another media outlet did a good story, then it got onto public radio, then a magazine and newspaper in Boston began doing profiles of us (due out in coming weeks). That&#39;s how things work--and how you get change. but you dont get it by being suspicious of every messenger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because there are just too many red flags being flown everywhere. If you applied that same standard to yourself or those you like, you would probably find seemingly suspicious things everywhere. It can become like a disease. Having said that, I think it is always wise to be alert to all possibilities. Re Omidyar and Greenwald, breaking my partial rule not to comment on other journalists per se (unless i am writing a critique which is something else) I do not question Glenn&#39;s motives. And i can tell you from experience with large document dumps, that it takes a long time to review and vet them, and longer to contextualize them for articles. Re Omidyar, i, like you and everyone else who reads the popular media, know who he is. But i cannot claim to know what is in his mind. </p>

<p>how long do we have to wait? 20? 30 years? </p>

<p>but thats not important regarding limited hangout possibilities</p>

<p>...whats important is that he hasnt revealed anything new </p>

<p>Last question (thx for the dialogue)</p>

<p>1) They sent Brian Williams thousands of miles to Interview Snowden, aired on PRIMETIME NBC.... is that not the biggest red flag of all? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Russ,
I really appreciate your work.  </p>

<p>How do you think the deep state will change in behavior after the passing of H.W. ?</p>

<p>Who were the cryptographers that were killed in the 911 pentagon attack and what were they working on?</p>

<p>Is the deep state alliance with israel solid or will this ever change?  Can israel infiltrate all US agencies or are there some that have resisted effectively?  Same question for encryption. </p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been a scandal like the Franklin coverup for a long time in the united states, where do you think they do their dirty deeds now?  I suspect the franklin thing shook them up some and they made serious rules about where things like that are allowed, I strongly suspect that place is south america.  </p>

<p>Is the deep state allied with the mexican cartels or is there conflict between them?  </p>

<p>Thanks, I hope I think of more for you,</p>

<p>mh</p>

<p>over 100 subscribers, people who question the official story on snowden</p>

<p>1- MSM gives him so much attention... nobody gets an interview with brian freakin williams if TPTB dont want the masses to know</p>

<p>2- told us nothing new. snowden confirmed what we knew 20 mins ago</p>

<p>3- his history, never seen his full record</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p>also, snowden may not know hes a lh, and greenwald may not know either</p>

<p><em>once CIA, always CIA</em></p>

<p><em>if its on the front page of TIME or the NYT.. it is not revolutionary</em></p>

<ul>
