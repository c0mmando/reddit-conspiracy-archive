    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I understand how this makes sense, but at the same time - I&#39;m not sure how it would make a difference. </p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re in a city, cops are more than likely in cars with cameras on them already. And if you&#39;re somewhere with cops on foot, chances are there are cameras in the city already.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather have my interactions with a cop filmed than not filmed. I&#39;m already at a disadvantage when it comes to their word vs mine. I know it will force at least a little bit of accountability (but I recognize there could be a camera &quot;malfunction&quot;). </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t believe that forcing police to wear cameras is a bad idea or that its a grand scheme for more surveillance - everybody already has smart phones, computers, there are cameras on traffic lights and street corners in most cities. </p>

<p>But I guess we&#39;ll see how its used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see the use for cameras because we already have footage of incidents, but still nothing happens. Accountability would be a more appropriate action in my book, but what do I know?</p>

<p>LAPD has GPS monitors installed on their vehicles and were caught turning them off, but nothing happened. That leads me to believe there will be a lot of &quot;malfunctions.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but I&#39;m hopeful that if there is more video evidence of police brutality, that with or without justice, there would be outrage. That alone is a step, and for me thats enough. </p>

<p>I mean look at it now, people are out in the streets demanding justice and demanding accountability. Imagine all the new videos that would surface of police brutality, unjustified murder, dog killing, etc. Even if there were malfunctions, that would be enough for at least the PEOPLE to get pissed off too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right to a point, in that cell phones and social media has made it harder for cops to be shitty. But not only is the police brutality narrative being pushed by media, but also the race narrative. I personally think that might have something to do with cliche of not being able to conquer if divided. They want to turn the normal people against each other, because if there is racial tension, we won&#39;t all be focused on the actual issue with authoritarian abuse. </p>

<p>There is absolutely institutionalized racism in America, but these recent issues seem to show more of a class struggle, a powerful vs weak struggle, not a <em>just</em> the white vs black thing the media foams at the mouth for. </p>

<p>Waco Texas is another example, (opnions aside) while the media framed the cult members as lunatics and pedophiles (not that they weren&#39;t) and some less biased outlets concentrated on the completely stupid operation led by law I enforcement agencies, the backlash and outcry led to the Oklahoma City bombings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole situation is conjectural. Poverty/inequality, TV ratings, political disenfranchisement, social media are playing a large role, exacerbated by race relations and militarization of the police force. </p>

<p>Of course this is just false dictonomy (akin to Dem vs GOP, 47% vs 53%, takers vs makers, immigrants vs nationals, east vs west) while the elites are literally ROFL. </p>

<p>Why now ? Because it was inevitable, the social tension bubble was bound to burst (<em>again</em>). The problem is how the media (and politicians, <em>experts</em>, <em>analysts</em>) is framing the crisis (racial tension) and not its root causes (socioeconomic disparity).</p>

<p>But again &quot;social reform&quot;, &quot;wealth redistribution&quot;, &quot;unionization&quot; are all curse words under our current sociopolitical paradigm. Socialism after all is <em>evil</em>. And thus it&#39;s much easier, more <em>click-baty</em> (since everything now is about those <em>page-views</em>), and more appeasing to our implanted cognitive biases to frame the current crisis as <strong>RT #RaceWars !!</strong></p>

MJ  is the reason... so instead of ignoring the TRAYVONS/ALEXANDRIA HILL&#39;S/CHAVIS CARTER&#39;S and sooo many more they will point these current ones out and make it about race, this way they can continue to hold their power with racism as the &quot;cause&quot; and noone is the wiser.</em></strong>   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a primer to get the general public in an uneasy state with their local law enforcement and will culminate in two or more distinct philosophical camps, those supporting militarization and martial law for the feeling of &quot;safety and security&quot; and those who are opposed to complete policing. </p>

<p>As of this either more &quot;transparency&quot; will be added to law enforcement or we will see national guard and armed military personnel stepping in for the &quot;defense&quot; of the common good. Political and philosophic enemies are a reality and reemerging. This tactic is used to find us dissenters who do not agree with their tactics, we are, by taking part only ousting ourselves for easier detection. </p>

<p>Then again I&#39;m a paranoid kook . . . </p>
