The truth vibrations are starting to vibrate ever faster and stronger. &quot;They&quot; know this, they know that they are going to lose and are so going to have one last desperate fight and drag us down with them. I predict in 2015 there will be lots of wars, false flags, highly infectious diseases (or no diseases at all; false flag diseases as an excuse for more vaccines), GMOs being pumped out a constantly faster and higher rate, more freedoms being taken away, more development on the transhumanist agenda etc until we have reached such a level of subordination and submission that there is no way we could get our way out again.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m basically trying to say, is, unless we, as a human race in 2015, get our stuff together and join together in unity against these parasites then we&#39;re not going to do it. We need to recognise that these four things - LOVE, PEACE, HARMONY and WISDOM - should govern everything, not MONEY, POWER, RELIGION or MEDIA.</p>

<p>Absolutely! People will except the current system with open arms, fair for all, all is fair. Really believe it&#39;s a generational thing, they will know no other reality except the one they have been taught, that will be their normal, and to them that&#39;s fine, total Huxley. Now the other, say, 20% or less will say &quot;are you crazy, it&#39;s a lie&quot;. So, being out numbered, the system will assimilated all those left with their &quot;New World Order&quot;, and you are left like Sutherland at the end of, invasion of the body snatchers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sheeit.  It&#39;s been &quot;the year for humanity to get its shit together&quot; since at <em>least</em> the 60s when all the racial bullshit and misconduct was going on.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been over half a century late as a society.</p>

<p>EDIT 1:  Actually I should have said it&#39;s been &quot;the year for humanity to get its shit together&quot; since the days of slavery in this country...So it&#39;s been well <em>over</em> a century since...</p>

<p>EDIT2:  None of this is to disagree with your OP heading.  OF COURSE it&#39;s time for us to get our shit together.  I don&#39;t feel that we will, however, for the same reason that we haven&#39;t done it up to this point:  We live in a world where TPTB make sure and keep us divided and separated from one another.  They do this on purpose, and we pretty much listen very attentively and do exactly what they indoctrinated and brainwashed into us pretty much from birth.</p>

<p>This is not to say that we as a people still shouldn&#39;t try, but the only way we&#39;ll really get our shit together is if we put all our bullshit, indoctrinated racisms aside and come together as the ONE PEOPLE which we indeed truly are.  We don&#39;t see each other as that, yet we ARE one people; one family.  The moment we all come together as that, we will easily beat the manipulation over us.</p>

<p>How likely is it that we all come together as the one people which we really and truly are, however?  How likely is it that we are going to be able to see through the bullshit indoctrination that TPTB have put in our heads?</p>

<p>It seems not very, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Heck, just reading some of the comments in this very subreddit, there are a LOOOOOT of happily and <em>proudly</em> racist people.  It&#39;s really absolutely fucking disgusting, but there are people here that feel very strongly in their heart of hearts that they are just inherently better than others types.  It&#39;s ignorant and involves tons of hubris...but it exists, unfortunately.</p>

I&#39;d agree with you 100% that we have to combat the racism which seeks to undermine the progress we&#39;ve made as a species (and which is being pushed by a problematic but organised minority here), and come together in the realisation that we are the human race, and that we need to get along, and start fixing problems!</p>

<p>And as far as our &quot;banging heads&quot; - heck...I don&#39;t even really know one way or the other.  I apparently &quot;bang heads&quot; with so many people on here that everyone and everything&#39;s just become one.  Big.  Blur to me.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you 100% brother. Times are changing and people are waking up to their own truth. The facade and the illusion is becoming all too apparent. And many people are waking up in droves. And not to worry this next revolution is a conscious one where we are evolving as a collective. What you&#39;re thinking and a feeling is a direct result of the global change that is now happening on earth. No matter what happens stay centered and grounded. You will always be protected and safe in the eye of the storm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth here&#39;s my opinion. Every year, every month, every day and every second is the time for humanity to get &quot;it&#39;s shit together&quot;. But I have a plot twist. Getting oneself together is the missing element. Waiting for others to do it, sitting on a computer talking about it and even dreaming about it are not taking action. There are so many actions I can take as an individual to shift the paradigm every day. It&#39;s up to each and every one of us to start dedicating our personal energy to making those small and large changes. For some of us a complete disconnect from &quot;society is necessary&quot; to form new communities. For others it&#39;s all about making choices to align with what we believe in. I&#39;m one of those walking the middle line. Still a part of society but playing the game to some extent. And yet aligning myself with what I believe in. Once a solid foundation is in place, it then can become about forming communities of like minded individuals and synthesizing the energies and aspirations from there. We can look back in all years and say a lot of people are waking up, this is the year coming..... But  IMO it&#39;s all about the self and inner reflection. What actions have I taken in the last year to become more self sufficient and even community involved? How can I develop this into further action next year while involving more folks in my inner sphere all while allowing others views and opinions to have equal merit? If that made sense. I&#39;m a firm believer that the old system is currently breaking down. It&#39;s not a solution to bandaid a problem for years or even generations. One part of the solution is to shift the current paradigm and reinvent the balance between the old ways and the new. Balance being the key. </p>
