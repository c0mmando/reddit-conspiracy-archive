        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I like coming to this sub, but there&#39;s a current top post about Adam Lanza&#39;s DNA that doesn&#39;t even link to any real evidence besides unsubstantiated claims. Any comments asking for real evidence and proof were downvoted or ignored and were never seriously addressed. I enjoy this sub because it allows me to see another perspective outside of the main narrative that questions the motivations behind said narrative. Instead, this sub is filled with unsubstantiated claims that get upvoted simply because they&#39;re outside the main narrative, regardless of evidence and critical analysis. So, because there is no actual discussion in the comments, I have to ask: Why would Sandy Hook be a hoax? What is accomplished by lying about it? What evidence do we have? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To push gun control. Before I was awake I saw Sandy Hook happen and my first thought was, &quot;there&#39;s no way this is real, it sounds like they&#39;re pushing for control.&quot; </p>

<p>I called my cousin who was a conspiracy theorists and said those words to him. He told me he had just had a discussion with a friend about the same things I said. At that point in my life I didn&#39;t believe in any conspiracies, but it&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t &quot;believe,&quot; I just never researched. </p>

<p>If you really want to know about SH, search it on reddit and read everything, then develop your own opinion. Dont just take what someone tells you on reddit for why it is or isn&#39;t a conspiracy and believe it as concrete. People push their own agendas. Read, form your own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just watched the 2.5 hour documentary. My thoughts is that there are a few interesting points surrounded by some pretty weak points.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, with the shear number of people involved to pull something like this off, it&#39;s unreasonable to determine that this was a hoax. Could an entire town be working together, going through drills in pulling something like this off? Yes it&#39;s possible in theory. But there&#39;s no way you can keep an entire town quiet for two years now without even one person coming forward. </p>

<p>In my opinion what happened was a small town that did not have a prior history of homicide (I believe there was only one shooting prior to SH) was victim of a horrific event and just did not know how to respond. That&#39;s why there are some responses by certain parties that can be considered odd, and to some, suspicious. No one knew how to respond in this situation, which is why there was so much confusion that day. </p>

<p>I believe Adam Lanza was an unstable kid with a controlling mother who may have been also unstable. Adam grew up in a family that owned quite a gun collection, so it&#39;s reasonable to assume he had experience with firearms. THAT is a more reasonable premise than an entire town pulling a fake shooting to promote anti-gun law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean no offense with this.</p>

<p>Sometimes we get people like you asking us to &quot;prove&quot; to them something is a conspiracy or a hoax.  These posts rarely do well here.</p>

<p>The reason being, is that not everyone here thinks that.  This isn&#39;t the &quot;Sandy Hook is a Hoax&quot; sub.  When it comes to that subject, there&#39;s plenty evidence available online for you to consider, but being you&#39;re asking such a direct question, it tells people you&#39;ve done next to no research on your own.</p>

<p>This really isn&#39;t a place to ask us to prove anything to you, as much as it&#39;s a place for you to try to prove something to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the problem is that you have a lot of idiots who believe that Sandy Hook was a hoax and their &quot;evidence&quot; to back it up is either completely false or scant at best. My point is, a post was just upvoted over 200+ times that linked to &quot;evidence&quot; wasn&#39;t actually evidence at all. If you read the actual forensic report that they link to then you would know that the title of that post is extremely misleading and almost entirely false. So I want to know if these people have any real evidence they can point me to instead of me googling through a bunch of sites that make the &quot;sandy hook was a hoax&quot; argument even more of a joke.</p>

<p>My main issue is that if were going to be a sub that is supposed to question the information being fed to us, why is no one actually critically thinking through a post that questions something like Sandy Hook? Instead we have a post at the top of the sub that makes us look like conspiratards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. See I studied physics in college so when someone posts something that directly contradicts the laws of physics, like the idea that we&#39;ve been in communication with alien life and it has gone unnoticed, I am going to want to call them an idiot because it marginalizes the thousands of years of science we&#39;ve done to get to this point of understanding. See, I&#39;ve stayed away from the Bigfoot example because I have absolutely no way of knowing if Bigfoot is real or not. But communication with alien life? We have ways of showing how ridiculous of a claim that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I clearly got too defensive with the idiot comments it is distracting from what I want to discuss I&#39;m sorry. But what I was trying to say was that there are laws of physics that govern communication. Communication with any aliens would be detectable by thousands of researchers and would have no chance to be covered up by a government. I just don&#39;t understand why there are people who feel the need to welcome every conspiracy theory. I welcome the idea that 9/11 was a hoax because there is quote a bit of evidence. But I will not believe that that the moon landing was a hoax or that the government is in communication with alien life, because neither of these things have good evidence to support them.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean those who hear you won&#39;t lose respect for you when you do so, though.</p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t help one&#39;s argument. I stop listening when the insults come out, as do most, and it doesn&#39;t win hearts and minds for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it seems using the word idiot was a mistake here. I don&#39;t think this sub is full of idiots. Far from it. I just don&#39;t understand why people who disagree with these conspiracies and try to show how ridiculous some of them sound just get down voted in this sub. All because I don&#39;t trust the MSM doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to trust a random post on reddit that aligns with my views. I would assume everyone in this sub would do the same. It just seems slightly ironic that I haven&#39;t received one answer to my questions aside from the link to the documentary but instead being questioned for even asking them in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If certain elements are able to spin conspiracy theorists into a tizzy thinking an entire event is a hoax, there will be fewer people and resources involved in getting down to the <em>real</em> conspiracies and cover-ups involved. It also muddies the water so that &quot;normals&quot; won&#39;t touch the conspiracy as it&#39;s tainted with a little bit of crazy. Same thing happened with the Boston Marathon bombing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed completely. The reason we can&#39;t expose the large actual conspiracies is because people who call them out are lumped together with idiots that repost a link on fb from FREEYOURMINDSHEEPLE.com</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should really dig into Halbig (the guy behind the hoax theory)&#39;s background and get back to me. I&#39;m not a &quot;skeptic shill,&quot; I am very tired of Halbig muddying the waters and covering up all the actual bad shit that&#39;s gone on up in Newtown. Also, do some googling on Susan Getzinger...crazy, crazy stuff up there no one will touch because they&#39;re too busy tarring conspiracy theorists because of Halbig&#39;s dufusness (who&#39;s funding him, eh?)...</p>

<p>All in all, I think there are far more important and pressing concerns than Sandy Hook.  We just need to realize it was a psy-op and move on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I&#39;m allowed to call someone who thinks that our planet is controlled by aliens an idiot because there is absolutely no evidence to substantiate that claim. I&#39;m a scientist and that&#39;s how I approach everything. People just like to look at the title of something and post it because it fits with what they want to believe instead of actually looking at the data and critically thinking about it. If I can&#39;t produce evidence for something, then why should I not be marginalized for my claim?</p>
