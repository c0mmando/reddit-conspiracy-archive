We are the change. Right here.
Anyone who says otherwise is not in their right mind and/or self-serving the system that hold down American Citizens. Us. The people.

       thanks to anyone willing to read this. i'm a college student, now i'm late for class.
Everyone in my school is very upset by what is going on in this country right now.
We are not only that, but more. Any old conspiracy theorists out there who think there's no hope in this world, I'll tell you, there's a lot of young people who are trying to find the truth, and they need you to start by having conversations w/ them. They won't talk to you first, and so you gotta catch their attention. It's not hard if they look smart enough.Every young person in mycollege knows that our system is broken. Some kids still don't know that MLK was murdered by the FBI !! It shocks me how much I know that others never considered. And you know why? It all goes back to required history books and our mediafeed.

       We first need to know how we got here:.
      </p>
      <p>
       Constitutional protections are reserved for American Citizens. We lost those protections when we became U.S citizens. We are all slaves to government that declared military rule back in 1866 when 9 states walked out of congress. After that the Command and Chief (the president) declared martial law and brought all states under military rule. We still live in that world today. We have traded rights and constitutional protections for privileges.

       It starts at chapter 8 where the whole problem started, but you probably want to look at the other chapters as well.

       The system was created for us, we either accept it as it is or we utilize our power to change policies that do not serve us, and create ones that protect us. This is our job as free people of America. We need to stop being apathetic about our situation and realize the only reason we still are living this way is b/c of that apathetic mindset.

       If you purchase consumer goods, you are inadvertently paying for the violence caused by the making of that product. Especially if it was imported from Mexico, China, Vietnam etc. etc.

       So, unless you grow all your own food [or only purchase local organic], and make all your own clothes.. oh, and you have to be a vegetarian (at least) in order for you to safely claim that you do not support violence in any way shape or form...

       You keep saying "support the American Government" and I keep saying "Change the American Government" ..you see, the difference is clear for anyone who can process logical thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are arguing for is that of apathy. Instead of participating and believing in effective change, you give up and want to convince others that trying is not worth the effort... And I'm here to say, to anyone who will listen, that trying is worth the effort, b/c what we have NOW is NOT working.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not talking to you anymore archonemis. You are nothing but an apathetic pawn in a game of billions. Giving up is too easy, and I am alive in this world to wake up as many people as I can, so that they can wake up as many people as they can, so they can wake up as many people as they.....

       Not just me, but there's a lot of people working on it. If you think that I think I'm going to change it all by myself, then you are defiantly going to be one of the stragglers at the end of the bandwagon. Apathy is poison, and I'm tired of drinking it. Hopefully one day you are too.

       This is the way everyone should be thinking but we know its hard to get everyone of the same page unless there is a major event that directly effects the mind of everyone. 9/11 is the perfect example of this. 9/11 was a single event that effected everyone alive and whoever did it knew this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fragmenting peoples thoughts is a power move of control. We see this when the media will not cover people protecting for change in the government. The government and media understand like minds should never be on the same page.

       If change is ever to happen everyone needs to understand this. I just wish it was not something to do with race like people think or the new presents.

       It is only slightly about race only b/c we still have a racist culture. However, as the killings continue, people will start to realize this is not just about race, but about the disenfranchised. And poor people are any and all races. White people are murdered by cops as well, but most of them are homeless

       I wouldn't mix messages here.  What Officer Wilson and Zimmerman did was legal self-defense.  Calling it "legal murder" just clouds your whole argument.  Yes, the militarization of police and the police state is a HUGE problem, but don't use these cases as examples!  There are plenty of other issues and cases to reference.  You're kind of all over the place in your rant.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for examples of the police state becoming rampant, I would cite the Boston bombings response.  An entire town was on an unconstitutional lockdown while police roamed the streets going door-to-door looking like they were ready for war in Iraq.  And the people just accepted it because "terrorism".  THIS is your example as to how bad it's getting.

       He wasn't a cop, he

        actually had injuries and proof

       to support his claim, and he wasn't as big as Wilson(Zimmerman was 5'10 IIRC to Trayvons 6'1/6'2 and TM was a football player), Wilson was as big as Brown. And he didn't outnumber him(As the cops did with Garner)

       Does it matter that Zimmerman wasn't a police officer? He was still let off in the same way as every other officer. Neighborhood watch, whatever. It doesn't matter. These people are still murderers getting away and making money off the death of Americans. Why justify any of it based on  superfluous nitpicky details?
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter. If Zimmerman had been black, if Trayvon Martin had been white, it's all stupid back and forth, not addressing the real issue, police have too much power and are too stupid to actually protect and serve.

       Why do schools stay in bussines?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here to tell you just cause all of you kids all the sudden found something you belive is pure dont mean shit. It isnt gonna matter until you leave school. Save your money get a trade like welding or carpentry. Hell even electrician journey men license.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even linemen. (They make bank)
      </p>
      <p>
       Know what nice about the jobs I listed? You wont be paying back loans the rest of your life. Yeah here is the real scoop I am 35 and my generation is fucked. You op are in your early 20s I am guessing. You are fucked too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your kids and mine might not be. Thats my hope. Police are not the problem its media. They are how you win this war. Its how Hitler controlled a country. He controlled the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       People belive what the magic box tells them. Its a fact. Sure maybe not you but the masses that dont care about anything but wondering where the next meal comes from or weather to pay the electricity or put gas in the car cause it all the money they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah those people. The media is set to divide us with fear and hate. They keeps saying Ferguson protesters. Wtf in nyc. I am sorry that kid got what was coming to him... the dude on staten island didnt. Thats what you should be protesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the toddler that got a flash bang to the face? Or the homeless man that got killed. Or how about the 91 year old man in Florida that just finally got a judge to say stop arresting him feeding homeless people.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have 330,000,000 people in this nation.  10% go hungry. Wtf?

       I am 29 years old and going to college to change my career and enrich my life. I don't need help w/ getting jobs. I have a very clear understanding of what is going on in this country. I have experience w/ seeing first hand police brutality, as my own mother was beaten by police back in the 90's. This has gone on too long, and I have had enough of standing by and waiting for everyone else to realize this needs to change today. There is so much to tackle, and legal citizen murder should be #1 as we are more likely to die from a cop than we are a "terrorist."
