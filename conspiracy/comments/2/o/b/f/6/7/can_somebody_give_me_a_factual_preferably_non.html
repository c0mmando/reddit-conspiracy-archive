       Im from Ireland, and my various news feeds and youtube videos are saturated with coverage about Mike brown, Eric garner , riots and general what-appears-to-be-revolution. Im struggling to keep up and I cant find a site that isnt leaning towards an agenda or opinionised shit. What is going on? Is america inherently racist and/or were these people completely wronged? A timeline of these events and everything in between would be helpful because I genuinely want to know what is happening!

       I won't address all of your questions, but I will tell you that America is definitely not on the verge of a revolution.  We're very tolerant of oppression, despite our rhetoric to the contrary.  We believe in The Constitution like we believe in the Bible.  In other words, we like it as a concept, we just don't agree with what it says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half of America is convinced that cops can kill anyone for any reason, as long as they make a written report that justifies their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is America racist?  In some ways it's more racist now than it's ever been.

       Seriously, we're no more prone to revolution than the Germans were in 1938.  People are marching toward oblivion with smiles on their faces.  Americans want totalitarianism.  They want suppression of minorities and intellectuals.  They want to hand the country over to the multi-nationals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democracy is dead here.  BUT we're not on the verge of revolution.  There's definitely no revolution on the horizon.  People actually want this.

       No.  People
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       want this...but we're also, as you very correctly point out, most definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       on the verge of any sort of revolution in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, this is the thing:  We've allowed ourselves to be turned into lazy, slothish pigs, so as much as we hate the idea of being completely ruled over by totalitarian overlords, the idea we hate A LOT MORE is the idea of doing without our Big Macs, our iPhones, our tvs, and our Western, American privilege.  We can't do without
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       , and, therefore, we will not revolt...because fighting against the powers that be means possibly having to do without all of these luxuries that we've been raised and indoctrinated with; luxuries that are actually WORSE for us and make us sicker and fatter and lazier and dumber and sicker and sicker by the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of fighting our powerful, oppressive overlords and ending up having to actually do without all these wonderful "luxuries" that living in a western society gives us...is just way too scary an idea for most of us to think about doing without.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we just keep hoping that TPTB put a LOOOOT of nice, slippery lube on that big cock of oppression they keep fucking us with...cuz we are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       about to try to stand up and live for ourselves.  Nuh uh!  Not when Married With Children is still on!  Cuz I gotta catch my reruns, baby!
      </p>

       I'd type more, but Monday Night Football is playing (on Thursday), so I gotta go!

       I can't argue with what you're saying because there's tons of truth in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say we want totalitarianism, it's a different kind of want (and I could have chosen a better word).  Just as a smoker doesn't
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       cancer, he's willing to take that risk rather than give up the tobacco.  So in a twisted way, he'll gladly accept the consequences rather than make a change.  Pretty much what you said.

       The problem in America is socioeconomic at its core. That turns out to have a racial component because there are more minorities in the lower income range. Cops are getting more aggressive, and that falls on the heads of those with the least resources to defend themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       That turns out to be blacks a lot of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       America has pockets of social racism, but I've been all over the US, and I think at least 80% of us are, at the very least, trying not to be... but it is very hard because the media paints a fucked up picture of society, blacks and whites alike, so it makes it really hard to have any opinions. Fuck the media.
There is TONS of institutional racism, stemming from outdated power structures, the drug war, the increased aggression of cops... historic distribution of wealth is a huge factor. Again, though, this is mostly a bias against socioeconomic classes, which is inherently race related in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is doing their thing. It's VERY hard to figure out what happened in cases like Brown, Garner or Trayvon because the media is such a hack infotainment bias strewn illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In America, there is an active group of energized people who are pissed at CORRUPT OFFICIALS abusing their power and UNJUSTLY and VIOLENTLY destroying lives with no repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local law enforcement is one of the few pieces of the government behemoth we can see. They are symbolic, and accessible, and so we rage at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things are spun as race wars because the story underneath resembles the truth --- far too much for the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM is dying... this is also another chapter in that story, as people come to Reddit or the Tube to find the truth... unavailable on your local Fox affiliate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also one of the later chapters of the story of a global awakening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's keep everything in context :)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the bigger picture, it doesn't matter if these particular cases were individually true. There is a pattern of abuse demonstrated by a thousand YouTube videos that didn't make the news.

       I miss Ireland. Went their once for 10 days.
I'd do anything to live their today.
      </p>
      <p>
       But moving on...It's pretty fucked up. Lots of things need to change but very few people seem to want to actually do anything to change anything. I'd blame the flouride in the water and the fact that we're such a large country.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said there is certainly some racism but the the media also likes to make things worse by playing that line to boost the amount of viewers they have by covering controversial topics in a very biased way which for the most part only makes it look more racist. That being said. There are some looters in Fergueson and they aren't really fighting for just Michael Brown but for the injustices that people have done to the community. Unfortunetly a lot of those looters are just fuck heads that don't really care abou the issue and are just profitting from the confusion and chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not looking any better any time soon.

       I've been to both actually! We started in Dublin, took a train to Galway. Took a tour of the cliffs of Moher, then we went to Cork from Galway before we circled back to Dublin before departure. You're right. I loved both cities. I could happily live in Cork.

       violence against people of color in this country has been ongoing for too long, there is also a HUGE gap between the very rich &amp; the working people, you'd be surprised at how many people in this country don't get (or have) food to eat everyday, many people are out of work or are not making enough money,
      </p>
      <p>
       America always 'talks' about being the home of the free, etc, but it's not,
we're aware that we are losing our privacy via social media &amp; phones,
      </p>
      <p>
       right now the main problem is the with the police (mostly White) shooting, killing young (&amp; not so young) Black males, there was also a video of a cop beating a Black women in the face, a young Black girl was shot, i could go on,
      </p>
      <p>
       some pollice 'see' the people they're supposed to protect as the enemy, because of the color of their skin,
      </p>
      <p>
       don't know how old you are but you may know of the Civil Rights movement in the 60's, well now we are in the 21st century and many people feel as though we are now fighting for our
       <em>
        HUMAN
       </em>
       rights,
      </p>
      <p>
       what's happening is focused on violence against people of color but White people have been abused as well, police/SWAT teams have crashed into their homes destroying property and killing people based on false information possibly provided by drug informers,
      </p>
      <p>
       many of us think the so called American dream has been hijacked by the rich &amp; the corporations they own, we feel as though we have been used and we are tired of being abused,
      </p>
      <p>
       and so we do what everyone else does in the world, we protest in the streets, we WANT PEACE, it's not the people that want war, pollution &amp; hunger, and we are so tired of innocent people being killed,
      </p>
      <p>
       we want human/civil rights for everyone.

       There are a lot of different mechanics in play in this country. No, we aren't inherently racist, at least not the ones with any sense. There are factors at work that help shape public opinion, factors which are designed to grab headlines and instill fear and anxiety, often at the same time. A big one is our media. They continually (thanks to the 24-hour news cycle) shell out all kinds of things to make us think that some imminent peril is threatening to kill us all: viruses, errant comets, scary radical Arabs, and the current favorite, race issues. Repeated

       , the apprehension and insecurity set in. Against the background of a shaky economic situation, this is quite the atmosphere to be living in. The sad thing is, as mentioned elsewhere here, is that people seem to just not want to do anything to change it for the better, or if they do, they're labelled 'terorrist' or are unpatriotic. It's not a question of what is happening, it's more of, what can be done to exact tangible and positive change. My $.02

       American's are not inherently racist. Just look how popular black celebrities like NDT, Will Smith, Morgan Freeman, ect. are. The problem is we have policies that are unintentionally racist, and keep the black population from climbing the socioeconomic ladder. Because of this many of them stick to crime like robbing and selling drugs. But to answer your question, no I don't think racism is more prevalent today, the media is just trying to distract us all by creating a racism debate.

       The US government now has its most corrupt administration in US history.
The government here is staging all of these events and they are dropping three bombshells on us meant to cause chaos.
The first was Mike Brown. No charges filed against the white cop who killed the black man. The number two bombshell was Eric Garner who was selling cigarettes illegally. No charges to the cop who murdered him. The number three bombshell will be Akai Gurley. He was completely innocent and got gunned down in a stairwell by an errant bullet. If no charges are filed on this one, I expect some serious blowback.

      <p>
       These are strategically timed events brought to us by the US govt. to fuel emotions. The police won't be able to handle the chaos so the blue helmets will come in. This is their way of making us subject to a federal police force.

       Eh.  They are protesting for criminals who took an assumed risk when they committed a crime and had bad luck on the cop they drew.  The media is hyping it up imo.  Its not revolution.   Its nothing more than another media event.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is/was more important stuff they should be out protesting but the sheep love divide and conquer ploys.  The only reason why it could get out of hand if it the media drives it and the movement gets hijacked by intelligence agencies.  The elite know exactly the plan and can hijack or squash movements pretty easily.   I can pinpoint a person in ferguson who squashed my local occupy group by hijacking certain aspects of it using ridiculous tactics.

       The garner case shouldn't be about racism at all. It should be about police brutality, and how they can seemingly kill a person and not even go to trial. The media making it about race takes the focus off the real issue.

       If they really thought he was a threat, they should have just tasered him. I also don't like this mentality that a person must automatically comply with cops and allow themselves to be put in handcuffs. What if Garner hadn't sold any cigarettes as he claimed in the video, and the officer was wrongfully accusing him? Does he have no right to resist? Wrongful arrest might as well be kidnapping in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lets say he had sold a cigarette, in the video he was peacefully resisting. He was not throwing punches or fighting back in any way, all he did was resist having his hands put behind his back. I have seen plenty of videos where this happens and the person isn't put into a chokehold.

       They had no cause to arrest him, he wasn't selling anything that day. Resisting arrest is not justification for summary execution. So your argument is bullshit.

       Sometimes strategies need pushed along.  Sometimes events need steered to the agendas goal.  Intelligence agencies are so compartmentalized a select percentage has any the slightest clue of the actual goal of it all.
