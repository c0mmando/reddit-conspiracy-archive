        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m from the US and absolutely disgusted with where this nation is going. The wars, the lies, the propaganda, everything. Everything I thought I knew about the US is a damn lie. I just watched this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2ghdM66U4Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2ghdM66U4Y</a></p>

<p>and it only reaffirms my beliefs that the US is a bunch of sick mother fuckers and no matter how much we &quot;chant unite, chant change&quot;. It not going to happen.</p>

<p>So where to go? I&#39;m open for ya&#39;lls opinion. I&#39;m a senior in the tech industry, mainly programming, web design, dev. Where would be a place to move to? I&#39;m open to the Nordics, love what Iceland is doing (I heard it&#39;s hard as fuck to get it), Sweden, Norway, Finland, anything cold and snowy doesn&#39;t bother me. I&#39;m open to humid as weather. South America, what ever, I prefer the Nordics though. What about Germany ? I speak English and that&#39;s about it, a little German but only elementary. </p>

<p>What are your all opinions. Coming from one disgusted US citizen to another, I really can&#39;t stand this place. Where shall I go?</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m not senior in age, in my 20&#39;s. But I have a lot of experience. Just wanted to point that out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the light and realized we (US citizens) are living a false life. So many people are living in harmony, so many people are providing for their people. Then we the US call them socialists, enemies, etc. It&#39;s wrong, I&#39;m sick of the people here. I say 95% of the US are ignorant dumb asses. I&#39;m thankful this community exists, where similar minds, detracting minds, and those on the fringe can actually all talk amongst each other. Share ideas, learn and grow.

    <div class="md"><p>Well by &quot;light side&quot;, I meant this: Not only have we been lied to in all our media, but our churches, our medicine, and... get this... our <strong>education</strong>. That&#39;s bad, that our own government has been deliberately steering our education and stifling certain sciences.</p>

<p>...but...</p>

<p>It also means that a lot of things that you previously thought impossible just might be possible after all. Crazy stuff, like astral travel, stargates, free energy... The more I dig, outside the mainstream, the more cool stuff I find. If we can make it through the next 5-10 years, shit is about to get amazing.</p>

<p>So as bad as it is -- and it is very, very bad -- try to remember that things are simultaneously <em>better</em> than you can imagine.</p>

<p>You know how there are banks and credit unions?</p>

<p>Well, imagine a savings institution based on each trade, say farmers for example. Farmers pool their money at a particular savings institution set up just for the farming trade and the institution gives back to the farming community.</p>

<p>Its a win-win. I think this could work on a grand scale.</p>

<p>Congo (or Kongo or Kongō) is the name of a major river in southern Africa, the Congo River.</p>

<p>It is also the name of two countries that border that river:</p>

<pre><code>the much larger Democratic Republic of the Congo (capital: Kinshasa), once known as Zaire;
the smaller Republic of the Congo to the northwest (capital: Brazzaville).

<p>You probably don&#39;t realize just how accurate that statement is.  Much of the leadership of the unholy trinity (City of London, Vatican City, Washington DC) is directly descended from the Roman empire and European aristocracy.  Meet the new kings, same as the old kings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they&#39;re not gonna listen -- nor would you or I, in their shoes.</p>

<p>&quot;Easy&quot;?.. No and yes. I had some anxiety, as I don&#39;t speak Spanish <em>at all</em>. But I had such a sense of impending doom that I forced the issue. I&#39;d just quit my day job (specialized IT) and had some money and a million frequent flyer miles saved up, so luckily that was not a concern. Basically, I flew into an airport near the Pacific coast, rented a car, and drove til I found a place that felt like home. I sold my cars in the US, packed my stuff in a shipping container &amp;amp; floated it down here. I don&#39;t want to think about how much all that cost.</p>

<p>Left my family and a really fantastic bunch of friends behind. I miss them a lot, for sure. I console myself with having a big enough place that if any of em &quot;wake up&quot; and need a halfway house, I got their back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to buy a place or ship all your stuff down like I did. (Part of my goal was to convert some soon-to-be-worthless US dollars into physical assets.) Rent can be super cheap here, like $250/month for something basic or $800 for a nice US-style apartment near the beach. Cars are real expensive here, and where I live there&#39;s still a lot of dirt roads, so they&#39;re beat all to hell. I bought a 3rd gen 4Runner in the &#39;States and shipped it down. Import tax is crazy here, so I&#39;d guess it cost $8-10k total to get it shipped and titled here, which is about what I paid for it.</p>

<p>Way easier just to have a laptop + a couple suitcases and just rent furnished apartments. Bounce around the world for a while, see where feels like home.</p>

<p>Cool.  I&#39;m lucky I have no kids and sold my...oh wait a minute.  I don&#39;t have a house.  I live in an apartment still.  But hey!  At least I don&#39;t have a big ass mortgage hanging over my head!  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man, I dunno what I&#39;d do in their shoes if I woke up...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah...I imagine that&#39;d be pretty damn fucked up.  You gotta spouse, 2.5 kids, 2 cars, and a big ass house you gotta keep slaving away for, and then suddenly you find out that your country and your life is a big, fat fucking lie.  Dayem.  Yeah.  I think that people either flip their lid, or they just go &quot;O_o Oh shit&quot; and then just shut that truth the fuck down - push it <em>waaayyyy</em> down deep inside and never let it see the light of day again...because looking at it too much would mean having to restructure their entire life and mindset.  Most of us Americans simply aren&#39;t willing to do that...Especially those of us that have husbands and wives and kids and cars and mortgages and jobs and are <em>balls deep</em> in debt and in the system, etc, etc...Damn.  Crazy shit.</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s part of why I feel there are certain definite benefits in the fact that - even though I&#39;m in my early 40s, am a perpetually jobless &quot;starving artist&quot; type that lives by themselves in a little apartment in a big city and with very little money (ha.  Good times!) - I can spend a LOT of my time (most if not all of it sometimes) pretty much researching and trying to find out what&#39;s REALLY going on in this world and cosmos.  Most people in my shoes are already set w/a family and kids and making &quot;career money&quot;, so to speak (and, again, likely balls deep in debt).  If I had a more set lifestyle with more rigid &quot;spouse/kids/family/house&quot; responsibilities, I might be a bit too preoccupied with that and trying to provide for myself and my family to have a better idea of what&#39;s REALLY going on around me.</p>

<p>Okay...So wait a minute.  You had never before visited Costa Rica...but you decided to...just go and MOVE there?  You <em>did</em> do a bit of research on the place <em>before</em> you moved there, of course (RIGHT?)...but still...What did you do?  Did you just...land there and say &quot;Welp...better find a place to live now...&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen that put in so many words before, but yeah that&#39;s so right. My brother (wife, 2 kids, middle level corporate manager, brand new 4000 ft<sup>2</sup> house) literally put his fingers in his ears and said &quot;Don&#39;t tell me. I don&#39;t want to know!&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d have woken up if I hadn&#39;t quit my day job. Researching all this stuff is a full-time job, like I&#39;m putting myself through college. Really enjoying it; feels like a quantum leap in consciousness. This could be a college major.</p>

<p>As for moving here... I did a little research (mostly climate), a couple trusted friends had visited and liked it, and a girl I worked with was from here. But yeah I took one trip to either find a place or veto the whole idea. Found a cheap property, flew back, packed up and said my goodbyes. I don&#39;t have a lot of people dependent on me, and I&#39;m pretty basic, so the risk was low as I saw it. FWIW, everybody says you should rent for a year before buying -- a lot of things are different than the &#39;States, and some people have trouble adjusting.</p>

<p>Kind of funny, I&#39;ll be going the artist route myself from here on out. I&#39;ll figure something out for money. Different paths...</p>

<p>You and me both.  I&#39;ve always had an idea even when I was a kid, but I really, consciously started researching and &quot;woke up&quot; a few years ago (4, 5 or so...6? can&#39;t even remember at this point).  Since then, it&#39;s taken up a bit of my time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Some of the information is AMAZINGLY eye-opening...A lot of it is not very benevolent information, but it gives you an idea of just how big this world and this universe is.</p>

<p>And it would be a college major if school wasn&#39;t essentially the state indoctrination machine that it for the most part definitely is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Germany is worse. It´s what America wants to be and it is a socialist nightmare. Every single thing you do there is tightly controlled and documented. Move from apartment 12 to apartment 14 - mandatory to register the move with the government (no not the post office ). Want to make some small crafts to sell? Can´t (legally) - unless you are properly trained and accredited to do so. Want to start even a tiny business with your own cash? You have to prove to the government - to their satisfaction - that you are educated in the field to their standard and can produce for them a multi-year plan with income figures. Oh  - year 3 you must pay your taxes for the year up front.</p>

<p>Not to mention that Germany is being overrun with foreigners who care nothing for the country and are milking the hell out of the benefits system on the backs of hard-working Germans. It is extremely sad to see.</p>

<p>If you don´t like &quot;the system&quot;, developed Europe is out unless you are a millionaire. Yes it looks OK still because it is still homogeneous to a good extent, but it is heading toward big trouble. Don´t let anyone fool you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be useful to know what your original country is, whether or not you are a dual passport holder, and whether that other country is currently EU or possibly CIS. Those are all very important points.</p>

<p>What you &#39;want&#39; to do and just fishing around for countries to move to isn&#39;t going to work.</p>

<p>We plan to expat, hopefully next year. I have put years of research into various countries and their residency visa requirements, investment visas, banking and tax issues, moving money.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t overstate the importance of meeting the requirements for residency visas.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing about your situation except that you are dissatisfied, tech accomplished, and probably hold a US passport, I would suggest you look at south America. Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama.</p>

<p>If your original country &#39;next to Russia&#39; allows you any kind of entry or exchange with the EU, I would suggest you look into Bulgaria, Czech Rep., Estonia and Croatia.</p>

<p>Need more information.</p>

<p>I hope you find what you&#39;re looking for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Switzerland, if you can afford it. The Scandinavian countries have been poisoned by a wave of Islamic non-white immigration. Australia, Canada, and New Zealand are infected with socialism and also are being poisoned by non-white immigration. England is already gone. So in France. Germany is on the brink. Maybe Russia would be a good long-term choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the light and realized we (US citizens) are living a false life. So many people are living in harmony, so many people are providing for their people. Then we the US call them socialists, enemies, etc. It&#39;s wrong, I&#39;m sick of the people here. I say 95% of the US are ignorant dumb asses. I&#39;m thankful this community exists, where similar minds, detracting minds, and those on the fringe can actually all talk amongst each other. Share ideas, learn and grow. What the fuck happened to US?</p>

<p>Congo (or Kongo or Kongō) is the name of a major river in southern Africa, the Congo River.</p>

<p>It is also the name of two countries that border that river:</p>

<pre><code>the much larger Democratic Republic of the Congo (capital: Kinshasa), once known as Zaire;
the smaller Republic of the Congo to the northwest (capital: Brazzaville).

<p>But I digress</p>
