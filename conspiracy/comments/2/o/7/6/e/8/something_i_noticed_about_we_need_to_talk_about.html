What I realized though, is that 2012 was a leap year, and although I would expect Google to account for that anomaly, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a digital camera would not, and cause exif data to reflect an inaccuracy in the date, possibly explaining why images would show events documented as happening a day prior to December 14. Just a thought I figured I&#39;d share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s where I have to disagree. Yes, there is a &quot;mountain&quot; of extremely suspicous circumstancial evidence, but hardly anything that undeniably confirms a fact beyond reasonable doubt. I also have a hard time giving credence to citations of government and media documents, when according to people that claim it to be a hoax, are the perpetrators in the first place. You can&#39;t accuse people of a crime and covering it up dishonestly, and then cite them as a source when it&#39;s convenient for your argument. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not how it works. Their evidence is inconsistent <em>with their own story</em>.</p>

<p>E.g., DNA evidence which does not coincide with the official story. That&#39;s &quot;police&quot; evidence that doesn&#39;t support their own story. Yes, it&#39;s applicable.</p>

<p>They are the ones making claims, and their evidence should back it up. That the DNA evidence (strongest evidence there is in this case, pretty much, besides any surveillance footage which doesn&#39;t exist) doesn&#39;t even have Lanza&#39;s fingerprints or DNA on the weapons.</p>

<p>How do you explain that as confirming the official story? It doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The DOJ, FBI, mainstream media and the state of Connecticut are highly coopted and corrupt institutions,  riddled with crime syndicate operatives.  They went along for a different agenda; demoralization, fear, a mental health and gun control agenda.  </p>

They also control the UN, the UN is their world government in waiting.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a web developer and I don&#39;t see how a leap year could cause dates to be off like that, it&#39;s definitely not the issue.</p>

<p>I also used to work for a major news agency. It was common to have news articles ready for upcoming events just so they could instantly be posted (like several different articles for each city which may be chosen for hosting the Olympics so the right one will be posted the very second the name of that city appears from an envelope on TV).</p>

<p>Some agencies would alter timestamps of their news alerts to indicate they were posted several minutes before they actually were, so that news aggregators like Google would indicate that their news article has been posted before anyone else&#39;s. It&#39;s a form of competition between different agencies.</p>

<p>However, to have an article posted significantly before the event had happened has no other explanation, other than the news originated from somewhere at that time and were reported as actual events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good point, IMO. I watched the documentary and it was a little interesting, but like others have said, it did little to convince me one way or the other.</p>

<p>The man who claimed the kids came to his house has always seemed fishy to me, and this documentary touched on that. But to me, it just seemed like a sick man looking to cash in on a tragedy. I don&#39;t believe he had any students come to his house, but I also don&#39;t think this means he was a part of a government cover-up. I think he just wanted his 15 minutes of fame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If, as you said you suspect Gene didn&#39;t have any kids at his home then he is guilty of numerous fellonies. The agencies responsible for the investigation are therefore guilty as well to allow this discrepancy to remain in the public record. If, however kids were at his home and as he stated they made clear statements about the shootings then he&#39;s guilty by not reporting that to the authorities. This is why, IMO Gene changed his story to now be that the kids didn&#39;t mention the shooting until 15-20 later. But, I don&#39;t think it builds creedance to the theory that a shooting took place, just that it may have been a way to avoid looking like he shirked his civic duty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gene Rosen, as well as the family members somehow being able to be on TV and give interviews without completely melting down are both highly suspicious,  no doubt. As well as the legislation to imprison people that would release death certificates, even though such documentation could be easily forged. I&#39;m not saying that there were no valid points made at all, as there were, but most of it was bastardized by the sensationalism and self-assuredness that was portrayed. It&#39;s one thing to be &quot;just asking questions&quot;, and another to be equating speculation and conjecture to having all the answers. It kind of reminded me of militant atheists spouting off about inconsistencies in the Bible, demanding proof of claims while giving themselves a pass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be honest, there&#39;s very little in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTafqejV6k">this documentary</a> which convinces me strongly one way or the other. The strongest arguments come in the form of political opposition to FOI acts and weapons control reform which the docu barely touches on. There should have been much more focus on that IMO, instead of darkened faces rambling on about unsubstantiated personal opinions and coincidences.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook really doesn&#39;t smell right at all. There&#39;s lots of apparent weirdness about the whole official story which is clearly bullshit (what&#39;s new?). This documentary doesn&#39;t smell right to me either. It&#39;s watery, off-track and vague. It&#39;s 2 and a half hours of ooh-ing and ahh-ing about unprovable so-what&#39;s. Maybe I&#39;m just being paranoid but it feels like very subtle disinfo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order for information to qualify as dis-info it first must be inacurate or misleading. As a contributor and the editor of the documentary, I welcome anyone to share their opinions. I tend not to interupt the exhange except to clarify something or to refute claims over the content. As your comment might be interpreted to mean the video contains false information, I&#39;m at least stating point blank that the information is as accurate possible. There are, however a few errors most being a case of reporting old information. Overall, it has little speculation and we tried to clarify when the total evidence available didn&#39;t meet the standards of proof. Most of what&#39;s presented isn&#39;t proof of anything. But, taken as a whole it proves beyond a doubt that the official report is largly a fabrication. Personally, I strongly suspect all medical and school records said to relate to AL are fraudulent. Just the point that only St. Rose of Lima school was suppoenad for AL records calls into question all the claims of his attendance at other schools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mother has forwarded emails from my aunt. And because I caught word of new evidence of the sandy hook hoax and wondered if there was a sub devoted to conspiracies. It&#39;s fine to not believe me but this is just slightly unclear. What exactly do conspiracy theorists believe? Do they believe that no one was actually killed and Adam Lanza just no longer exists or what? It&#39;s very unclear to me honestly. It seems too many pieces are missing. Please do explain (no sarcasm whatsoever)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, the documentary states nothing whatsoever and doesn&#39;t posit any theories. Secondly, what people who look into this suspect is that the children simply never existed and that either Adam Lanza never existed or had been long deceased by the time of the SH event. This is not the only suspicion, but just the one I find most prominent. I suggest, when exchanging information on this very issue that we not conflate things by mixing language that confirms the children&#39;s existence with questions of whether they did or not.</p>

They also control the UN, the UN is their world government in waiting.  The Bankers fund gun control advocates, though that&#39;s not to say that gun control advocates are necessarily bad (they have the best intentions), but they are being used as pawns by The Bankers for a what is a sinister agenda.</p>
