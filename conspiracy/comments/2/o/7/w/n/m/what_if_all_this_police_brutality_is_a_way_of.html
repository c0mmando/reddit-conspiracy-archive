Is it a way of conditioning us to accept this brutality? It sure as fuck is making me think twice before I exercise my rights when encountering the law. These fucker are getting away with to much and I honestly think nothing will change. Its just being paraded in front of so that we all are aware of what could happen if you fight back. What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The important point is that you&#39;re SEEING it. And hearing about it, reading about it, etc. This means that the very few people controlling the media WANT you to see it. If they wanted to cover it up, you would barely hear a whisper about it.
You&#39;re also seeing what great guys your soldiers are, and have already seen at least one case of a soldier confronting a policeman about his behavior, and will probably see more in the future.
The problem isn&#39;t having them declare martial law, it&#39;s all the people around you who are being manipulated into VOTING for it.
You see, if someone forces this on you, then they&#39;re clearly responsible for it and therefore a target for resistance and possibly rebellion, but if you vote for it, who are you going to blame? What can you rally around? &quot;The TV made me do it?&quot; That just sounds crazy, and weak.
You&#39;d have no one to blame but your own friends and neighbors, and the TV and Internet would be right there reinforcing it. Egging it on.
Then the fighting breaks out and more soldiers are needed to keep the peace, which actually causes more fighting which requires more soldiers. Which is great, because more and more people are getting desperate for jobs, and joining the army is the way to go. Loot, pillage, rape, murder, AND you get paid? Hell yeah! Sign up boys!
And all the while you&#39;re losing your rights, freedoms, property and possessions, until finally you&#39;re thankful to make thirty cents a day stitching sneakers because then you might not have to sell your children to prostitution rings.
Holy Hell! Got a little carried away there. Anyway, the point I&#39;m trying to make is that when you see this stuff on TV, someone CHOSE for you to see it. They chose to broadcast it. You&#39;re supposed to react exactly the way you do react to it. 
So if you feel that the police are bad guys who are hurting the people they&#39;re supposed to be protecting, it&#39;s because someone wanted you to feel that way. That&#39;s how it was presented. There are no impartial journalists trying to show both sides of the story here, it&#39;s all National Enquirer crap. Journalistic integrity no longer exists. It&#39;s all theatre. A commercial. They&#39;re selling it to you.
Why?</p>

I have friends that are officers and I often ask why they are provided &quot;free passes&quot; if they accidentally shoot a civilian. In Afghanistan, if we so much as fired a warning shot, CID was all up in your grill making you sign sworn statements and such. God forbid you actually shoot someone on accident.

They enforce policy for policy makers and nothing more.  So why does almost every cop car I have ever seen say something like &quot;Serve &amp; Protect&quot;? I seems to me that the only people they serve and protect are themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK you&#39;ve one part of the story.  Ramped up authoritarianism, deepening the conditioning on those who have accepted it.</p>

<p>Another part is to agitate non-authoritarians into increased violence against police, creating more &quot;villians&quot; here in the &quot;Homeland&quot;.  Once it&#39;s been made perfectly clear that police can do what they want without legal repercussion, more people are driven to seek justice outside the courts.  That may mean resistance (including lethal response) to LEO aggression, or retaliation.  This is probably more important than conditioning people to accept authority, because once cops start dying at a rate higher than pizza delivery drivers, people will clamor to give them even more power, and sympathies for non-authoritarian ideologies will weaken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They want us to accept cameras on police officers.  That way the public is being filmed at all times.  Just another way for them to track our movements.  I think they know that the youth is going to eventually become rebellious and become united.  If they can put in a system now that discourages this type of movement then they will be able to nip that kind of discontent in the bud.</p>

<p>except its not really that small of a percentage (should be 0), and its getting worse .. the reason its getting worse is now they are in the media getting away with it, more exposure, more conditioning</p>

<p>Just a year or so ago the common comment when there was police brutality against a violent criminal was &#39;he deserved it&#39;</p>

<p>Now that comment is being used for non-violent brutality</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also think that all this bad behavior is not dealt with because that is one more reason we should be putting cameras out thete to watch us.  If we are taught to believe that cameras on police officers are there to protect us, then we will be willing to have them wear one.  But over all, it is just one more area that they will use to keep us in line.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprized to see camera footage accepted in court as evidece ofa persons wrong doing and since footage  can be selected and used to manipulate scenarios I don&#39;t think this method will be all that reliable. </p>
