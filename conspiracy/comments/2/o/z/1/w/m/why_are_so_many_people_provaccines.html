       The vast majority of people have no idea what goes into creating a vaccine. The overwhelming majority of doctors only get a cursory education on the subject (less than 6 hours.) Vaccines are created and produced by the lowest bidder, and are comprise the cheapest of ingredients. That alone should make everyone insist on the choice of vaccine brands.
       <em>
        Not that they don't already exist.

       Why are so many people anti- (every) vaccine?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some vaccines are good / helpful. Some don't do much - no harm, no good. Some seem to do more harm than good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the anti-vac movement against ALL of them? Why is it all or nothing? Why is nobody on either side telling the truth?

      <p>
       We know the agenda of the "every vaccine is good" crowd - money at a minimum.

       This is really a big problem too.  There is significant evidence against some vaccinations and poisons put in them.  But not all.  And some vaccines have clearly done much more good than harm.  Some are suspicious as to how much good they actually do.  We need to separate them instead of saying its just all bad all the time.

       saying every single one is bad, well, at least the sane ones.

       Try bringing up any vaccine trial or programme that has links to nefarious activity on one of the more popular subs and you will see.

      <p>
       When I was a kid there was less than a dozen vaccines, now look how many there are.. The point of most antivaxers seems to be that we are helping the sick and frail at the expense of the fit. Seems to go against nature.

      <p>
       I agree with the sane part of your comment. However, if you look about the anti-vac movement - web sites and people spouting things in public - the vast majority of them call all vaccines bad. I have not yet found one that says, "these are bad for this reason but these are good". Not one.

       Maybe I've just missed them?

      <p>
       That is meaningless to the conversation. Science will progress. Technological and medical progress seem to be advancing on an exponential curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, that doesn't mean that everything is good. That just means that just because there are "more than before", they're not all bad, either.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Humane, empathetic humans help the sick and the frail. It is a societal advantage. And it's the right thing to do.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        at the expense of the fit
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The whole of that - "we are helping the sick and the frail
       <strong>
        at the expense of the fit
       </strong>
       " - seems to assume that vaccines are good if you're sick or frail but harmful if you're fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would vaccines that help sick people harm fit ones? Do they carry genetic markers to immunize only those with a low white blood cell count or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       All that aside, what we ought to do as parents is understand every single thing we're considering putting into our children's bodies. Food, medicine, vaccines, everything. One at a time. And make a decision one at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a perfect world, we could trust the government to protect the people. That was theoretically its job at one point. But obviously that's not the case any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a better world than we have today, we could trust watchdog groups to inform the people. But, as I've said, I haven't seen the group that tells the truth about vaccines - some are good and some might be harmful with real data to back that up. They're on either extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of a protective government and legit watchdog groups, it falls to us individually.

       The people who question vaccines do not all have blogs. Unfortunately thus world is run by the squeaky wheels and the people with agendas or extreme views squeak the loudest.

       YES! For fuck's sake YES! Life is important! It's the MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE UNIVERSE! It doesn't matter if you're too frail to move. Your life is important! So is the dude you don't know laying there on the stretcher, and who the fuck are YOU to put HIS life at risk?

       No. You won't believe what I type anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to do the research for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could start by gaining an understanding of thermiosal, how it is similar and different from "raw" mercury, the relative dosages of it in the vaccines that carry it compared to the relative dosages in, say, tuna fish, and how the human digestive system processes metals into the bloodstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could do the same with formaldehyde, especially comparing and contrasting the dosages in the vaccines with the amount the human body makes on its own each day or the amount in a simple pear, again informed by your research on how the digestive system processes food into the blood stream.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, you might want to do the same with aluminum, the effects thereof on the human nervous system, and compare the dosages in vaccines that carry it (esp. those given in the first 6 months of life) with the dosages provided by mother's / breast milk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice in that I haven't said which are OK and which are bad. You need to do the research and gain the understanding for yourself. It's the only way you'll learn.

       Right. So I'd have to reproduce the entirety of my research here for you to convince you of something that I really, truly don't care whether or not you're convinced of.

       Let me ask you this: Do you think it's reasonable to believe that EVERY SINGLE VACCINE is bad? Every one? No redeeming qualities in any of them. They either do nothing or are more harmful than good. 100%?

       OK, I'll give you one to see how you react.

       Formaldehyde content in a vaccine is not a valid reason to avoid the vaccine. Based on my research, the amount of formaldehyde in the vaccines is minuscule compared with the amount of formaldehyde an infant will get in their bloodstream from eating a jar of baby food pears, even when the digestive system's filtering is taken into account. It's even smaller than the amount of formaldehyde baby's body makes on its own over the course of a very small number of days.

       The amount and type of formaldehyde created naturally in an infants body differs greatly from the type and concentration of formaldehyde in vaccines. Why would you lie about that very simple fact? It's like you have ZERO medical training and are merely shitting out propaganda from 2009. If you were current in your microbiological studies you would be familiar with the biochemical studies of the tracheobronchial epithelium. Which negates your dated "natural formaldehyde created by children make cheap additives okay" propaganda.

       Also you suggest the chemical composition of the formaldehyde humans make in their bodies is different from that in the vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was aware that thimerosal is not mercury - the chemical composition is different. But this is the first I've learned that the formaldehyde is different. In all the searching and reading I've done, and it was quite a lot of hours, I've never seen that stated about formaldehyde.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you provide a link to a reasonably reputable site (read: not an anti-vac site) that describes how formaldehyde produced in humans is different from the formaldehyde used in vaccines?

       The problem with just your assertion is that it makes you the same, less than really, the doctors who say, "Trust me, vaccines are good."

       No data from either side makes it hard to convince a non doctor (the people making decisions about whether or not to vaccinate their kids) of either argument.

       Plus... you SAY you're a doctor. If I go to my doctor's office, I can at least see his credentials.

       I never said vaccines were bad. You want a link to a medical education? My assertion is based on knowledge. I never asked for your trust. I never claimed vaccines were bad. I presented no data. I merely pointed out your ignorance of the subject matter. I never claimed to be a medical doctor...yet you admit that anyone could fool you with a framed piece of paper.  Like I said, please contact me when you are done with your medical education so we can have a cogent conversation on the subject. It's too frustrating to spoon feed and address ever single propaganda talking point...especially since it comprises the majority of your present education on the subject. Do yourself a favor and stick to things you can grasp. Like weed or whatever...deep thinking/memorization might not be your strong point. If you are afraid of vaccinations, or concerned about any side effect for you and your family, get a genetic predisposition check...they only cost about $1000. If your family was properly vaccinated in the past, there is a good chance you genetically past on the immunity...Case closed.

       How hard can it be, really, to link a site that explains the differences between 2 types of formaldehyde you assert? It's really easy to find one that explains the differences between thimerosal and mercury.

       Do you like not having to worry about dying of smallpox or getting polio? You can thank vaccines for that. Don't forget about Whooping cough, Measles or Tuberculosis. All of these have seen the amount of case drop dramatically because of the development of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       You aren't fighting some experimental treatment here. Vaccines for these diseases have been around for decades, and have been shown to save millions of lives annually. We are literally using them to systematically destroy some of the worst illnesses in the history of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask "how can anyone be pro-vaccine". I would ask "How can you not be?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some vaccines do more harm than good? Maybe, although I haven't heard a compelling scientific case for any of the ones being used commonly today. Perhaps you could show me some.

       Well, first of all, there are outliers in any situation. There could be a myriad of reasons why the whooping cough outbreak effected the people the way it did in Massachusetts. It appears that in this situation, the vaccine hasn't been as effective as initially expected, and requiring a booster. Not exactly a giant blow to the massive amount of proof for the effectiveness of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       One case like this doesn't invalidate more than a century of successful vaccination, backed up by a massive quantity of peer-reviewed data. One case that was blown out of proportion by anti-vaxxers doesn't invalidate all of that. I noticed you didn't respond to what I said about Smallpox or Polio. Vaccines literally eradicated smallpox off the face of the earth. This is a disease that nearly wiped out civilizations, now completely destroyed thanks to our development of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your laughable citing of the long ago debunked connection between autism and vaccines,
       <a href="https://www2.aap.org/immunization/families/faq/vaccinestudies.pdf">
        here
       </a>
       is a summary conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics of scientific studies that looked for a causal relationship between vaccines and autism. The amount of people in these studies combined are in the millions, spanning a variety of countries over the course of many decades. No correlation found.

       Cigarettes aren't the cause of lung cancer.  that was the legal cover lie for the open air radiological testing.  It still harms humanity today, and is blamed on smoking.  Cancer rates could only be down because people aren't getting SV40 tainted (purposefully) polio vaccines.

       So the carcinogens in tobacco don't really make the case for you? Or that 90% of lung cancer occurs in people who smoke?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of non-smokers out there - the numbers would be an instant giveaway if they were getting lung cancer at anything like the same rates.

       Unfortunately, it's not really a good argument.  At least, this website isn't.  All of the links are directly back to their website.  There seem to be no outside evidence at all.  It doesn't make for a very believable argument.

       Whale.to is actually a repository for information. It links back to itself but it's always outside content, they just dump it there.

       Sometimes it will provide an outside link, sometimes it just dumps the info there. It's all outside evidence.

       Not at all.  I apologize for the mistake.  I'm at work, and admittedly, I didn't take a super close look at things.  I looked at a few pages, and noticed the self-links.  I should have looked around more, and of that I am guilty.

       Hopefully everyone on this sub is open to their current state of thinking being challenged.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in my year+ here, I have noticed that some are not. Some people simply cannot shake their deeply held belief on some topics regardless the evidence presented (or lack of evidence, evident).
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'm a "show me the evidence" type of thinker. Real evidence. Peer reviewed scientific studies get my attention. Information published directly by the producer of goods get my attention. Truly independent studies are the best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assertions of fact that rely upon circular references or wild ass, already disproven theories earn my ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
       On vaccines, I've already stated my stance based on quite a bit of research that I've done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some are helpful without harm. Some are harmful without help. Some are the same as injecting saline - neither harmful nor helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       And both sides of the issue are lying through their fucking teeth, so BOTH sides of the issue cannot be trusted. We have to research each one ourselves to figure out the benefit or chance of harm present in each vaccine.

       Wow - your "intelligent and thoughtful discussion" in the comments almost appears as if it isn´t a shameless attempt to marginalize and insult people who want no part of any vaccine. You still can´t quite get there. The "sane" comment  from both "sides" gave that one away. Try again in a week or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how you cut it, if vaccines were so great, people would all want to get them. Kind of like cars. Since you both are most likely sitting near each other at the office, you should discuss your failing and try with even more subtlety next time.

       Also you suggest the chemical composition of the formaldehyde humans make in their bodies is different from that in the vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was aware that thimerosal is not mercury - the chemical composition is different. But this is the first I've learned that the formaldehyde is different. In all the searching and reading I've done, and it was quite a lot of hours, I've never seen that stated about formaldehyde.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you provide a link to a reasonably reputable site (read: not an anti-vac site) that describes how formaldehyde produced in humans is different from the formaldehyde used in vaccines?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with just your assertion is that it makes you the same, less than really, the doctors who say, "Trust me, vaccines are good."
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying, "Trust me, vaccines are bad."
      </p>
      <p>
       No data from either side makes it hard to convince a non doctor (the people making decisions about whether or not to vaccinate their kids) of either argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus... you SAY you're a doctor. If I go to my doctor's office, I can at least see his credentials.

       Most of your comments appear to be abusive in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you unable to debate people without insulting them too?
      </p>
      <p>
       You should realise that by abusing people you will make them notice the insult, and not see the information in your words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which are you most interested in conveying?
