<p>Anyway, as a dairy farmer in New Zealand I&#39;m looking for advice to what to do in this situation. Currently I&#39;m just a manager, but looking to take on a position with some equity. Perhaps buy some land and some cows. Is this a good idea?</p>

<p>Demand will still be strong for food I am guessing, so I dont need to get out of the industry altogether?</p>

<p>$5 bitcoin tips for the top 3 answers, but only if I find them useful! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding, the only thing you can do to prepare for a collapse in the currency used in your country is to stockpile things you&#39;d need to get with that currency.</p>

<p>Look back to the fall of the any currency and you&#39;ll see skyrocketing prices on normal commodities - flour, eggs, milk, meats, etc... So the best thing you can do is find an alternative to those items. Network with local farmers and gardeners, start your own garden and get chickens to lay eggs and produce meat. Learn basic survival skills because if you can&#39;t get meat, you&#39;re likely to have no heat or electricity (or the means to pay for them). So I&#39;d recommend to start getting firewood, build a brick oven, etc...</p>

<p>Basically, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done with my family here in South Texas. Parents have land with well water and a septic tank for sewage. Besides electricity, which solar panels will help, they only need something for heat/fire to cook. They have gas now, but what if that source is gone? </p>

<p>Easy - you setup a fish tank (very large) with any sort of fish you can eat and that is hardy, like Tilapia or something. You collect the excrement and basically let it ferment and collect the gas that&#39;s produced. Its methane! You can burn it as you would propane. </p>

<p>So we&#39;ve got a few large tanks with tilapia in them, heaters for the water during colder months (although partially burying them helps a lot too), a stockpile of wood that&#39;s being seasoned and is ready, a grey water usage system in process, rain water collection, solar panels for water heating and electricity, about 40 chickens providing eggs, about 10 turkeys for meat, ducks for feathers, meat, and eggs, and a huge garden with most veggies you can get at a local (tomatoes, peppers, corn, herbs, potatoes, carrots, etc...).</p>

<p>If you can get started on that or have most of it, you&#39;re better off than over half the suckers out there. </p>

<p>Plus, even if the world doesn&#39;t go fuck all mental, then you&#39;ll save loads and be more environmentally sound.</p>

<p>EDIT: The only issue thus far is medical care. Its not like you can grow aspirin or get hydrocodone. Unfortunately, the draconian drug laws prevent growing of cannabis for fiber (clothing, ropes, etc), fuel (heat, fire, etc), food, medicine, and recreation. Opium poppies would take care of the hard painkillers, but also super illegal to possess, let alone grow and cultivate. There are ways around this, and facing a certain economic collapse would probably push anyone to ignore the illegality of substances and plants, so it may come to a point of &quot;who cares!&quot;</p>

<p>LAST EDIT: You will also need a way to protect all this investment because there are always those that will be unprepared and instead, prepare to just take what others have made. Not sure on your take on guns, but they&#39;re recommended. Learn how to shoot, how to hunt and field dress carcasses, how to clean your weapons, and perhaps even how to refill shells to reuse them for more ammo.</p>

<p>In the event of a dollar collapse, the best protection for you and yours will be a diverse group of people you know and trust.</p>

<p>Start planning on what you&#39;ll do for food. What skills do you have? Any trades? Can you trade something you can so for something you want?</p>

<p>If not, get crackin&#39;! That&#39;s the best, non-violent, non-tinfoil crazy prepper mentality propagating in the states.</p>

<p>A side effect of this is you will likely get more involved in your community, cultivate more and better relationships (and maybe cows and veggies too), which are good things to have regardless of dollar collapsing events.</p>

<p>as far as collapse of society preparations...you live in New Zealand...I don&#39;t see you having much of a problem...</p>

<p>I look at it this way. IF you never went to the store again...how long could you live? When my answer was only a couple of weeks, I sold my urban accoutrements and moved to a more rural location. Built a greenhouse, installed an expensive and inefficient solar array, with a diesel generator backup. Clean water, Fish...enough room for cattle or whatever...it&#39;s boring as shit sometimes...then I remember that I can shoot firearms 24/7 naked without concern...I brew my own beer, distill a small amount of alcohol...life could be more complicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly by 2020 the dollar won&#39;t be the dollar we know today. I don&#39;t expect 2015 to be pretty and wouldn&#39;t be surprised if 2015 is it, but there is a decent chance they can keep it going, or keep it going about as well as it has been since 2008 anyway.</p>

<p>Internally, this country is super fucked. It is like watching a slow motion car crash waiting for the moment of actual impact. People are sick, tired, broke and depressed and too distracted or scared to admit it. Pretty much any HFT hiccup, regional natural disaster, energy crunch or headline about a big BRICS non-dollar trade agreement at the wrong(or right) moment could be enough to bring it down at this point. </p>

<p>Since you&#39;re in NZ and probably know something about farming and have connections, you&#39;re gonna be sheltered from the majority of the initial shitstorm. Get good with your neighbors, get rid of all debts, invest in your ability to propagate food and water systems. I think homesteading is a great move and I&#39;m working towards it myself. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about your life so it is hard to say more than that. Basically just imagine how your life would change if you couldn&#39;t rely on currency, imports and gasoline as much and you&#39;ll be ahead of the curve since you&#39;re not in the USA.</p>

<p>The US Dollar will still be strong for a long time although the writing on the wall is clear. Buy gold, buy a rifle and ammo, buy storable food and water, and have property that you OWN OUTRIGHT (not mortgaged). Other than that just tell your family and friends how you&#39;re feeling and let them now why you are taking the steps you are (it&#39;s to protect yourself and them when the time eventually comes).</p>

<p>Go to APMEX.com and buy Silver coins for everyone in your family for Xmas. When the shit goes down (not for another 10-20 years I&#39;d say), gold and silver will be the only money that counts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not think there will be a soon, or a certain point to put it better. We will continue to see a gradual decline, if you think the fed and US govt will simply let this happen, you&#39;re lying to yourself. The best thing to do is immediately spend those dollars while still valued: buy gold or silver coins in case the cows don&#39;t produce, buy more cows, sheep, goats, whatever you can find that is a valuable asset to yourself. Others here have recommended guns, or batteries, or bullion, but it needs to be whatever asset is most valuable to you. Another thing to do would be to de dollarize your income; you&#39;re in NZ, can you sell specialty cheeses or something to mainland China, maybe get some Yuan(tied to the dollar for now,but not forever)? </p>

<p>If I were you, yes I&#39;d be a farmer for as long as I could. Seemingly there could be another financial crash at any moment, and as these continue we will continue to lose jobs for a multitude of reasons, but either way employment will decline worldwide. Having a food producing position will be one of the few truly protected, needed, wanted positions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How to prepare for the collapse of the US dollar?  Why not look at the people who are collapsing it, and follow their lead(they profit after all).  Invest in gold, silver(not paper, real gold, silver.  The &quot;paper&quot; gold market is many many many times bigger than the &quot;real&quot; gold market, and will collapse if the U.S. dollar collapses.  There is not enough real gold to fill all the paper orders by a long, long, long shot).  Get &quot;real&quot; value out of your US-dollar dependent currency because whether the value drops(suddenly), or continues devalue(steadily), in the near future, the U.S. dollar will collapse, to make way for a Regional, or Global currency.  Gold will always be valuable, and is compact(easy to hide, transport, trade), and cannot be confiscated by Government(unless they find it), or others(like a house or car could).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are trying to be sarcastic, but if you look at history, you are inadvertently being literal.  Whenever governments tank, or &quot;infrastructure collapses&quot;, gold prices SOAR.  Gold is one of the oldest currencies of man, and has been valued extremely highly through periods of order, and especially highly during periods of disorder. When confidence in fiat currency(and thus the government) wanes, the relative price of gold increases compared to said currency.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think gold is valued high in historical records? </p>

<p>See I dont want to belive that. Why the hell would anyone place value on an object they cant use? You cant eat it. Makes a shitty weapon, and I see no use for it other then trinkets and electrical applications. </p>

<p>Food, fuel, and clean water are value. Its because they are consumables.  They are also what you need to survive. If worse comes to worse and I am left up the creek these are what I would barter with. Not for gold thou. </p>

<p>Everyone keeps saying get the shiney stuff. Why? It is a form of slavery really. It takes so much effort to get such a small amount.  By all means wrap all your investment into it if you wish. Personally I will be enjoying my meatloaf and green beans while you and millions of others stare at a container full of shiney stuff.</p>
