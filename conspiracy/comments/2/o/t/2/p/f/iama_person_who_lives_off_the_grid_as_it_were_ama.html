       Also refers to Anarcho-primitivism in a way.

       I thought this topic could be interesting to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Basically, I live alone, and I provide for my needs through my own ingenuity. I've developed a good way to survive on my own without reliance on society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've come up with a way to use natural light during the day and a basic method of lighting at night. I've configured my home for basic electrical logistics that's self sufficient for my home environment and even a method of storage of electricity safely and effectively. (I consulted an authoritative guide on electrical energy very closely of course.) I also constructed my own PC as well as a good internet router. They both run quite well actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Near my home there is a garden where I can grow fruits and vegetables, enough to fill me with a good supply of horticulture. I obtain water naturally but of course I filter it well in a filter that is designed to filter out impurities such as pathogens and generally particulates in water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of my food comes from crossbow hunting, as well as traps meant for smaller animals. Crossbows have relatively renewable ammunition, not to mention quieter. The downside is if the first shot isn't a killshot, it will take many more shots to kill, so I've learned how to make the first shot your best shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I'm outside or even inside, I wear a gas mask for safety reasons. I'd rather not run any risks. It's a fairly effective mask that is highly similar to the kind of gas mask the military would use in these days. It has relatively innocuous solutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       My contact with society is minimal, I can mostly achieve my survival without their help. The intention behind this was to strengthen myself. I am not weak, I am strong for this independence. It liberates me, it makes me feel truly alive and in my element.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually suggest living off the grid, for one thing it's a unique experience. Not to mention the government won't have as much of an effect on you. Living out here in the forestry I am not as affected by the law because the law has no practical reach here. I am able to avoid their reach, and in the event of an apocalypse I already have the resources to ensure my survival.

       It's in the woods, cut off from society but not cut off from the wildlife which I can hunt for decent meat and skin. Nobody really can claim this land practically, I saved up money over time to be able to construct a sturdy home, I even consulted in-depth architectural guides.

       In a philosophical sense, corporations never really made the parts, their workers did and the corporation is just a holistic manifestation in society of that presence.

       I mentioned I have a means of generating energy, basically solar panels but I do have a basic reserve system so that I can use energy even when the sun isn't supplying me with sunlight. Because I am one person, the solar panel can supply me with sufficient energy, I also try to use natural light whenever possible and I also carry a flashlight which can be charged in the daytime with a strong reserve battery for when it is needed.

       I don't see how you avoid extortion and harassment by the fascist machine. How do you pay its mortgage/taxes/rent? And if you are living freely on land seized and occupied by said machine, how do you avoid its enforcers?

       The fascist machine doesn't really account for someone living off the grid. Think about it, they'd have to have some concrete record that I live here, and that I exist. I made all the proper arrangements, no more bills, no more mortgage.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the fascist machine, it's like trying to play chess in the dark. Not to mention I don't really benefit from society, so arguably there's no real reason for me to pay the taxes of a society.

       I'm interested in living off the land but not in the way you are trying to present it. Sorry, this sounds more like an subtle attempt to manipulate people into thinking that living off the grid is not advantageous.

       Staying away from people does not bring happiness, we need human contact and we need to work together to make things better for each other. An island unto oneself is a flawed concept.

       In a sense, I don't talk to people, but I still have a journal, and away from society I can find peace, I find solitude. I am independent and yet, I survive and find where I feel I belong. I feel at harmony with who I want to be.

       That way, chemicals in the air have little to no effect on me, both intentional and unintentional. Not to mention in the case of an epidemic, the air could become easily poisonous.

       Why do you think I filter out my water? Also, from a holistic standpoint it would be more difficult for me to get infected because I don't consume the lungs, even if I did the chemicals would be more sparse and less likely to breach the blood-brain barrier. Or cause any long term damage to my respiratory system.

       You sound like a
       <em>
        bad ass
       </em>
       motherfucker.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) How long have you been doing this/have you been living off the grid?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Have you had any contact with any other humans in this time?  Do you have any contact with any other humans?

      <p>
       3) Do you have a motor vehicle?  Do you drive anywhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Do you go to a grocery store for any reason?  Are there any needs that you go "back into society" for?
      </p>
      <p>
       5) How old are you? 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s?

      <p>
       6) What made you make this change?

      <p>
       7) Did you leave anyone behind when you made this change?
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Do you have a significant other?  I'm assuming you don't, but am asking anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) Do you ever feel any need to look for or
       <em>
        want

       a significant other?  Do you ever get lonely or want to go back into "society"?

       Okay.  Fair enough.  One, I'm generally a person that tends to take everything pretty seriously.  Two, there are

       I thought maybe I just didn't read that right, and simply gave it the benefit of the doubt and left it alone.  I have to admit though, I found that...a little bit on the extreme side as well.

      <p>
       Yep.  It has literally always affected mine.  I got to the point in my life, however, where I finally said "Wait a minute.  I'm either going to hide who I really am/what I really feel and be fake with people just so I can try to keep some stupid 'friends' that I don't even care about all that much and that I'm pretty sure don't care about me, or I'm going to be fucking
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       and those that think I'm 'weird' - well simply
       <em>
        fuck them
       </em>
       .  And those that
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       think I'm weird and continue being w/me/jiving w/me even after all that? I'll know I really and truly get along with them and I can be very/super real w/them and feel good and productive."
      </p>
      <p>
       I have basically two friends and a girlfriend that fit the bill at this point in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the two friends are in two different states away from me, so I almost never talk with them anymore...and my girlfriend?  Ha.  She more tolerates me than anything else lol...and occasionally (
       <em>
        occasionally
       </em>
       ) we'll get into deep conversations about what's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       going on in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, ultimately, I don't really have anyone that I really "jive" with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh well...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd rather be in the state that I'm currently in, however, than to be hiding who I really am and what I really feel with whoever it is I come across/get to know for fear that they'll think I'm some sort of "weirdo" and no longer talk to me if they know the "real" me.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fuck that, and fuck them if they reject me for being real and honest" is basically my motto in life at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work hard at being nice and respectful to as many people as I possibly can...but I work even harder at making sure and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       hiding who I really am and what I really feel.  :)

       Believe me I can relate.  The only reason I can have occasional semi-serious/indepth conversations with the gf is because we've been together for over ten years (!!) and in that time we've had some
       <em>
        serious
       </em>
       wars in terms of her thinking I'm some sort of "crazy insane person" saying some of the things that I was saying...until she finally saw that at least
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of the things that I said were coming to pass, and she went
       <strong>
        O_o
       </strong>
       and started paying a
       <em>
        little
       </em>
       bit more attention and asking a few more questions here and there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's definitely been a long, hard road, however, and it's not like she just intuitively or naturally gravitates to any of these subjects that I read about, study, and investigate.

       Congrats on the decade commitment. I'm at 12 myself and she gives me the distance to go do my thing late at night and thinks I'm into 'crazy conspiracy theories' and that nothing will come of it. She's stuck in the mindset that she's just a cog in this machine we call Life, and that she has a clearly defined role and responsibilities that while are true, can and do change over time once one is aware of certain things.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I blacked our names out (like she knows my user name here - ha) and has her read a printout of this or any of our other conversations, she'd call those two lunatics and be thankful that I'm not as 'crazy as them.'
      </p>
      <p>
       All she cares about is the kid, and me a distant second, and I'm OK with that. There's someone beautiful and profound about that kind of devotion, even if I have turned into a big dreamer and she is more grounded (according to her - and she's probably right anyway). As long as I don't rock her boat she doesn't rock mine, and I'm forced to explore concepts and ideas with a dude on the internet on some creepy corner of reddit, where 38% of the posts on the front of r/new are probably about CIA torture, Jews, or infowars.

       Yeah.  Things're definitely complicated.  No kids here...and that allows me the opportunity to go "full retard" on my investigations...but, whereas she's got a real job making real money (something I'm

       happy and appreciative about), I'm a starving artist type barely scraping two cents together, barely paying rent, and living month to month. lol.  I tell her we can't get hitched till I start making more $...who know when

        Yep. It has literally always affected mine. I got to the point in my life, however, where I finally said "Wait a minute. I'm either going to hide who I really am/what I really feel and be fake with people just so I can try to keep some stupid 'friends' that I don't even care about all that much and that I'm pretty sure don't care about me, or I'm going to be fucking real and those that think I'm 'weird' - well simply fuck them. And those that don't think I'm weird and continue being w/me/jiving w/me even after all that? I'll know I really and truly get along with them and I can be very/super real w/them and feel good and productive."

       Good to know that there are other people like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to balance my not giving a fuck about what other people think by also simply being as nice and courteous a person to others as my "not giving a fuck" allows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a "mean" person.  I'm one that will generally go out of their way to be very nice to people, as a matter of fact.  However, I also won't change my views or perspectives on what I feel is right even if I find an entire crowd (or even city) of people feeling the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm certainly not perfect, but I try to go on what seems/is "right" based on intelligence, reason, and wisdom (or at least as much of it as I can generate anyway).  I'm definitely willing to change or alter my p.o.v. if a good, valid reason for doing so arises, but, if one doesn't arise, then I'd rather live in a room alone knowing I'm right, than in a crowded room full of people that are all wrong.

       Yeah. I am forgiving and decent to people as long as they show they are also decent people. However I can be pretty short with what kinds of conversations I'll have. As soon as people start talking about sports, tv, crap they bought etc as if it was part of their identity, I go out of my way to inject a little shame into their game or get them to actually talk about real stuff.

       Exactly.  I try to be cool even if the person ISN'T cool...but yeah...I can get pretty damn upset if it seems I'm dealing with a bully.  I do NOT like people with oppressive bully mentalities or personalities.  I REALLY rage against that.

       I talk a

       I tend to say "I have
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       idea what you're talking about."  Once they see that I repeatedly respond with blank stares, "mehs" and shoulder shrugs over whatever pop or MSM reference they bring up, they tend to just...stop.  Fortunately, I can't say I come across too many if any occasions when I have to deal with someone talking about things like that to me much.

        You sound like a bad ass motherfucker.

       Pretty much, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Several years
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Not really any direct contact, I mostly stay in the woods, occasionally a group of kids will see me and think I'm some sort of alien or robot due to my gas mask. They'll mostly just stay away from me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My system by design allows me to avoid contact with humanity. That allows me freedom and overall, happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) I actually designed a collapsible bicycle. Think about it, a bicycle is an efficiently bio-powered system of transportation that's relatively easy for maintenance. It doesn't need gasoline, but it can reach fairly high speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's made of light but sturdy material that can support my weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) No, I can get my groceries from nature, there's no need to involve the marketplace unless I need something that can't be extracted from nature, or I can't design myself. In that case, I have reserve currency I've collected over the years, it's interesting how much money you save up overall finding coins someone dropped in the woods.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.) I am in my 30s.
      </p>
      <p>
       6.) I got an interest in survivalism in general, how to hunt for food, how to build a fire, a shelter, how to skin a hide, how to navigate by the stars in the sky, it all interested me greatly. Eventually it just seemed preferable to a life in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       7.) No, I was pretty much living alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.) No, I didn't have an SO.
      </p>
      <p>
       9.) Not really, I like the peaceful solitude, gives me time to think my own thoughts.
