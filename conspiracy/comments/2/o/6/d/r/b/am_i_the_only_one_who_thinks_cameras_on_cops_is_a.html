        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We don&#39;t have a lack of evidence issue when it comes to the problem of abusive cops. We have a lack of accountability problem. Cops don&#39;t really need body cameras. They need to be held accountable when they commit crimes. It&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>Now, we have a public, who in the midst of a fervor around privacy violations, is clamoring for millions of cameras to be aimed at them. Millions of cameras that are attached to representatives of the system that proves itself, daily, to be unaccountable and abusive!</p>

<p>Am I the only one who thinks this is a terrible idea? People seem suspicious, at least, at the idea of fixed cameras monitoring us everywhere, yet they are begging for cameras to be placed on cops. So, now we have ambulatory cameras attached to they very men and women who go around behaving above the law.</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly ironic and hilarious if it weren&#39;t so stupefyingly frightening.</p>

<p>tl;dr --Cop body cams are going to be used against you and me faaaar more than they will ever be used to hold abusive cops accountable.  </p>

<p>However, I&#39;ve gotta say, I still think it would favor the public. Think about how many times a squad car&#39;s dash cam (or any security camera for that matter) &quot;malfunctions&quot; during critical moments. </p>

<p>The only way the lapel cams would help this problem, is if they are accompanied by a law that states all chargers are dropped whenever a camera &quot;malfunctions&quot;.</p>

<p>Edit: The cameras should also have clearly visible red Recording lights on them, so both the cops and the citizens can identify when they are on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see where it helps. We have physical records of many cops abusing their authority and committing crimes against people, yet they were either acquitted or never even taken to trial. </p>

<p>If the system has shown, time and again, that solid evidence does not produce justice, then what&#39;s the point of providing more evidence? Reform needs to occur in the way we prosecute abusive police officers. That&#39;s where I feel the change needs to occur. I don&#39;t think body cams do much in regards to reform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would cite examples of where this clearly isn&#39;t the case but I don&#39;t want to be accused of cherry picking. Nevertheless, there are so many clear examples of crimes ranging from assault to murder being committed by cops where the crime was caught on camera and often with sound. Yet, these cops were either acquitted or never brought to trial.</p>

<p>Even with the evidence, these criminals receive the &quot;benefit of the doubt.&quot; A privilege not afforded to many.</p>

<p>I always worry about viewpoints like this, simply because it depends on the compliance of millions of people.  And even then, it still begs the question of why?  Sure, you could have (I have no idea how many cops are in the US) police officers recording you and everything else, but who&#39;s gonna look through that?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m simply saying that rejecting something out-of-hand just because the government/police did it is somewhat counterproductive.

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what i&#39;m doing. I just think it won&#39;t work, since police forces are notorious for lack of accountability and corruption; especially when it comes to recording devices. Cops even have a term for a cop who perjures: testilying. That&#39;s how common it is.</p>

<p>I want the government to be held accountable to its citizens. That means believing testimony and allowing recording devices without the cameraperson being attacked or threatened.

<p>Yeah, I understand what you&#39;re saying.  I think I mistyped what I meant, and that&#39;s causing the problem.  What I meant to say was why would they care about, say, you?  Or me?  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I completely understand the concept of the dystopian police state and such, and I&#39;m not suggesting that&#39;s not a possible outcome.  More the question of why.  Or maybe not even why, but how.  A lot of things would have to happen to reach that, and a lot of people would have to be more than blind to a lot of changes before a dystopian dictatorship could ever rise.  I&#39;m not sure that in today&#39;s sci-fi reading reality, that it&#39;s going to be possible, but I do find it interesting that sci-fi books that discuss dystopian futures never quite explain <em>how</em> they got there.</p>

<p>Oh, no, I apologize, I wasn&#39;t specifically referencing you.  More of a general explanation of my thoughts.  I guess what I&#39;m really thinking is that what needs to happen is a rehaul of the system, rather than denying a device that can potentially <em>help</em> the common man.</p>

<p>Oh, I agree with you there, accountability needs to be restored in the system before any progress can be made.  The police are widely distrusted, and that&#39;s not a way a society can be and still grow.  The most important thing that needs to happen is to weed out corruption not only in the police force, but the whole government (especially those goddamn lobbyists).</p>

<p>Still, I&#39;m not sure I agree that the corruption in the police force is quite as widespread as believed in this sub.  It is the unfortunate truth that the worst voices are always the loudest.  In that case, you never hear (or you didn&#39;t hear, before all this) about justified cop shootings.  The only thing we as citizens ever hear about is the questionable ones, places where a body camera might have assisted in clearing up confusion.  And a lot of that is on the media, who only pick up the &quot;newsworthy&quot; issues, and ignore pretty much every possible positive thing the police force does, because &quot;cop does his job&quot; doesn&#39;t sell as many papers as &quot;cop shoots unarmed black kid&quot;.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is that we should shoot all the newspeople first.  ;)</p>

<p>(no I&#39;m not serious, I work at a newspaper, please don&#39;t kill me)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. This. What&#39;s the point of cameras if the system doesn&#39;t hold the perpetrator accountable to the crime? Kelly Thomas was threatened in full view of a camera and mic. Then, he was beaten to death as he cried out for his father. Acquittals all around. </p>

<p>Cameras aren&#39;t the problem and I&#39;m beginning to suspect that the real reason for the media fervor around Mike Brown is not to advance police accountability but to get the public behind a million ambulatory security cameras. </p>

<p>The president has announced measures to begin sending cameras out to PD&#39;s and it&#39;s already happening. Can&#39;t help but feel this was part of the agenda, all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point but I don&#39;t agree with you. I feel cops should have body cams for accountability. In the recent case of Mike Brown, we never got to see the interaction between Wilson and Brown which gives us only speculation as to what happened. Yes there was court testimony from both sides but they differed pretty greatly. A body camera on police will give us raw interaction between the two parties. </p>

<p>Will this or can this be used against us? Probably, but it&#39;s not like cops are watching us in our houses so I don&#39;t understand why it even becomes a matter of privacy violations if we&#39;re in public. Cops will probably have the ability to turn off the camera if they want to, but hopefully that will work against them as it obviously shows they are trying to hide something.</p>

<p>I really think all cops should have body cameras.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they&#39;re not really watching MORE of our moves with police body cameras, are they? Unless you already have police stationed in your bedroom and bathroom. That&#39;s the point I don&#39;t get about this argument against body cameras, it&#39;s not going to mean cops are suddenly going to be in places they&#39;re already not. And if they want to go somewhere, our complacent public has already determined they have the right by virtue of being a cop to go there.</p>

<p>So why not ensure your own safety and the officer&#39;s integrity by making him wear a camera that can be accessed by internal affairs and (ideally) the public at large?</p>

<p>If there&#39;s an aspect I&#39;m missing, I&#39;m open to being advised. </p>

<p>Also, we have to look at the police unions that will go to great lengths to protect piece of shit cops and will spend all kinds of money in lawyers fees.

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the main issue with body cameras on police in the current configuration.  </p>

<p>Earlier this week, Obama proposed legislation that would appropriate 280+ mil for 50,000 new camera. That&#39;s great and everything, but as it is right now, the cameras must be turned on prior to an incident, the data is not secured and can even be edited or deleted locally, thus rendering the device useless.</p>

<p>Not trying to hijack your post, but I&#39;m actually working with a close friend to develop a brand new and exciting app-based technology that we are hopeful will revolutionize how we interact with police during contact with law enforcement. </p>

<p>We&#39;re a couple months removed from our first crowdfunding campaign,  which has enabled us to complete phase one of the app&#39;s design. Within two weeks, we will be launching our second campaign and we&#39;re hopeful we&#39;ll raise enough to compete construction of the app. </p>

<p>The main idea with the app is about educating users on their rights, while providing an added layer of protection between themselevs and law enforement. Users will be able to chose between just recording audio/video of the incident, (which will be stored securely on remote servers and unable to be tampered with locally), or they will be able do the same thing, but with a licensed/practicing attorney in the session as well. </p>

<p>Putting the finishing touches on our re-vamped website before it goes live, but still happy to discuss the idea or timelines a bit more if anyone is interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about evidence in the past is that it was always able to be played as &quot;insufficient&quot; because of camera angles, false witness reports, etc. The body cams give recorded evidence from the perspective of the person in question, making it much more reliable and credible.

    <div class="md"><p>Other posters have said this but I will repeat. Cameras and video footage is the only way to curtail police abuse. Filing a complaint against a cop (which in itself is almost impossible, seeing as though they are the ones that take the complaint and review it themselves...and never find fault with themselves) but without video evidence you have NO,ZIP,ZERO chance of prevailing they take the cops word and ignore yours period, proven time and time again. Sadly even with camera footage the system so favors the police they still cannot be brought to justice 99 times out of a hundred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The police want them. There&#39;s quite a few reasons why, but acquiring them is no small cost. Federal mandate and funding cover at least half the cost. </p>

<p>Fewer defendants will get away on technicality. Police won&#39;t be required to testify, the video will be their stand-in, that lowers cost and increases productivity. Claims against police can be substantiated, that&#39;s true, but cameras on cops will serve to exonerate the cops in many of those cases where complaints against police are filed. People behave better when they&#39;re on camera so police will have fewer confrontations with belligerent citizens.</p>

<p>And then there the mobile live streaming technology that can put higher-ups at the front of theline in raids and other things like that, like they can do with cameras on combat troops. Cameras provide increased intelligence gathering capabilities. </p>

<p>All in all, conviction rates will rise making the return on police labor a better investment for the locality and the prison system. it&#39;s no longer your word vs. the cop&#39;s word. It&#39;s the camera and that&#39;s it. Police reports can be written with the benefit of having the video to review. Technical mistakes can be avoided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They will not be storing the footage that they capture in perpetuity. I highly doubt that local police departments are willing to spend the kind of money necessary to store (let alone analyze) the video that is collected from every single body camera all of the time. The way I see the data being handled is it only gets stored temporarily, say a couple weeks or a month, and then erased. If there is an incident reported before that time then all relevant footage from said incident gets saved and reviewed. Everything else gets deleted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re a decent idea if used properly. The problem is that, as we&#39;ve seen, even with video evidence of cops in the middle of committing crimes, they just get let off the hook.</p>

<p>So they defacto become tools FOR the police to continue their oppression and brutality, because there is no chance of consequences if they tamper with the camera footage, as we can clearly see already.</p>

<p>tl;dr --Cop body cams are going to be used against you and me faaaar more than they will ever be used to hold abusive cops accountable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think is a valid argument. Cameras are likely to moderate police malfeasance and aggression, and it will provide evidence of such abuse when it happens. I have had little interaction with the police, but if I was stopped by the police for any reason, I would rather they were recording than not. I don&#39;t see how it could harm the interests of people interacting with the police.</p>

But anything you say that would help you they cant are not aloud to say. so would the video the cam takes only be used to discredit and hurt your case? Or will it be used for the better of the worse of the being that was arrested?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good angle to argue, however I think the idea is more to corroborate or annihilate the police officers story when something happens that needs to be investigated further.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve wonder myself about the privacy implications, but also about the data itself. Where will it be held? Will it be centralized and shared between other agencies? Will some data be completely public, like the mugshot websites? If data is private and not public, is it encrypted?</p>

<p>Its definitely another angle that TPTB will use to gather more intel on people, but luckily this will be mostly with regards to interactions with LEO.</p>

<p>Look how ineffective on upholding accountability these cop videos that are showing up on the web.</p>

<p>You are onto something. Would be great if you could gather some evidence to support this idea.</p>
