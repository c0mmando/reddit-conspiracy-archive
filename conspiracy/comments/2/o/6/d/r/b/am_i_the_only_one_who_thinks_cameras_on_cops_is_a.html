       We don't have a lack of evidence issue when it comes to the problem of abusive cops. We have a lack of accountability problem. Cops don't really need body cameras. They need to be held accountable when they commit crimes. It's that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we have a public, who in the midst of a fervor around privacy violations, is clamoring for millions of cameras to be aimed at them. Millions of cameras that are attached to representatives of the system that proves itself, daily, to be unaccountable and abusive!
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I the only one who thinks this is a terrible idea? People seem suspicious, at least, at the idea of fixed cameras monitoring us everywhere, yet they are begging for cameras to be placed on cops. So, now we have ambulatory cameras attached to they very men and women who go around behaving above the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's incredibly ironic and hilarious if it weren't so stupefyingly frightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr --Cop body cams are going to be used against you and me faaaar more than they will ever be used to hold abusive cops accountable.

       This is a really interesting point, I never really thought about it like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I've gotta say, I still think it would favor the public. Think about how many times a squad car's dash cam (or any security camera for that matter) "malfunctions" during critical moments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way the lapel cams would help this problem, is if they are accompanied by a law that states all chargers are dropped whenever a camera "malfunctions".
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: The cameras should also have clearly visible red Recording lights on them, so both the cops and the citizens can identify when they are on.

       That implies they can be turned off.  So why would a cop ever turn it on when they are about to bust some skulls?

       They should be tamper-proofed like ankle bracelets are, cops should not be able to turn them off under any circumstances. If there is a problem then they need to return to the station and replace the problem camera with a new working one.

       I don't see where it helps. We have physical records of many cops abusing their authority and committing crimes against people, yet they were either acquitted or never even taken to trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the system has shown, time and again, that solid evidence does not produce justice, then what's the point of providing more evidence? Reform needs to occur in the way we prosecute abusive police officers. That's where I feel the change needs to occur. I don't think body cams do much in regards to reform.

       That's a separate problem, though, perhaps with the courts or judicial system. Considering there are many cases where a lack of video evidence allows the cops to heavily distort the facts, I think overall it will reduce police misbehaviour.

       Up until Rodney King, the "benefit of the doubt" always went to the police officer. Video records of their behaviour will change outcomes. Perhaps not overnight, but it is real oversight.

       I would cite examples of where this clearly isn't the case but I don't want to be accused of cherry picking. Nevertheless, there are so many clear examples of crimes ranging from assault to murder being committed by cops where the crime was caught on camera and often with sound. Yet, these cops were either acquitted or never brought to trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with the evidence, these criminals receive the "benefit of the doubt." A privilege not afforded to many.

       The social norms about race and "good ole boy" policing are relics that we have inherited that are being eroded by an evolving public record of this behaviour. It's hard to see change when you are in the midst of it, but advocating for less oversight (in the form of cameras) is not going to be productive towards that change.

       That is a very good point. I suppose ive fell for the propaganda and i was hoping that it would result it better behaving police. Absolutely correct if they werent convicted before why should they be now.

       Ideally it's a positive move. The next fight is to make sure those gizmos don't keep failing or are outright turned off whenever the wearer commits something fishy, that the footage is always available as evidence with no edits, and most importantly that this measure doesn't preclude citizens from legally recording their own. I can see it,

       That's just it. They'll use the footage to show when a cop did something right, but 'lose' it when he doesn't. The cop will also know where it's pointed, so he'll just do everything off cam. If he kicks a guy in the knee and the guy falls down on him, "look! this guy attacked me!"

       I think the thing to remember is that body cameras would
       <em>
        add
       </em>
       to methods of determining accountability, rather than replace.  The cams could be a good step in the direction of forcing accountability for police officers and their conduct, but they certainly wouldn't replace any of the methods we have now, such as forensics and eyewitness testimony.

       We have multiple angles and multiple cameras of a cop shooting a man in cold blood in Walmart, without shouting a warning or making any kinds of demands. The man knew the cops were there when he got shot, after which he tried to run/hide (as anyone would), which prompted the cops to shoot him until he died.
      </p>
      <p>
       These cops were just acquitted.

       We don't need more footage, we need more accountability. We have enough footage to put thousands of cops in jail if it were anyone other than a cop doing it.

       Body cams are just their way of monitoring us, and digging into obscure laws to further punish the uncooperative. "You said the word flea, and according to a state law in 1815 that is a misdemeanor offense on Thursdays."  That is the purpose of body cams; not to hold cops accountable, but to further oppress the public.

       I always worry about viewpoints like this, simply because it depends on the compliance of millions of people.  And even then, it still begs the question of why?  Sure, you could have (I have no idea how many cops are in the US) police officers recording you and everything else, but who's gonna look through that?

       I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm simply saying that rejecting something out-of-hand just because the government/police did it is somewhat counterproductive.  If you're fighting to make the government work for you, but you slap its hand every time it does, you're never going to get the outcome you want.

       I don't think that's what i'm doing. I just think it won't work, since police forces are notorious for lack of accountability and corruption; especially when it comes to recording devices. Cops even have a term for a cop who perjures: testilying. That's how common it is.

       I want the government to be held accountable to its citizens. That means believing testimony and allowing recording devices without the cameraperson being attacked or threatened. What i don't want is for the government to have control over those videos, which is what will happen in case of body cams. Less government is a better government.

       Don't get me wrong, I completely understand the concept of the dystopian police state and such, and I'm not suggesting that's not a possible outcome.  More the question of why.  Or maybe not even why, but how.  A lot of things would have to happen to reach that, and a lot of people would have to be more than blind to a lot of changes before a dystopian dictatorship could ever rise.  I'm not sure that in today's sci-fi reading reality, that it's going to be possible, but I do find it interesting that sci-fi books that discuss dystopian futures never quite explain
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       they got there.

       Oh, I agree with you there, accountability needs to be restored in the system before any progress can be made.  The police are widely distrusted, and that's not a way a society can be and still grow.  The most important thing that needs to happen is to weed out corruption not only in the police force, but the whole government (especially those goddamn lobbyists).
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I'm not sure I agree that the corruption in the police force is quite as widespread as believed in this sub.  It is the unfortunate truth that the worst voices are always the loudest.  In that case, you never hear (or you didn't hear, before all this) about justified cop shootings.  The only thing we as citizens ever hear about is the questionable ones, places where a body camera might have assisted in clearing up confusion.  And a lot of that is on the media, who only pick up the "newsworthy" issues, and ignore pretty much every possible positive thing the police force does, because "cop does his job" doesn't sell as many papers as "cop shoots unarmed black kid".
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm saying is that we should shoot all the newspeople first.  ;)

       Yes. This. What's the point of cameras if the system doesn't hold the perpetrator accountable to the crime? Kelly Thomas was threatened in full view of a camera and mic. Then, he was beaten to death as he cried out for his father. Acquittals all around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cameras aren't the problem and I'm beginning to suspect that the real reason for the media fervor around Mike Brown is not to advance police accountability but to get the public behind a million ambulatory security cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president has announced measures to begin sending cameras out to PD's and it's already happening. Can't help but feel this was part of the agenda, all along.

       I see your point but I don't agree with you. I feel cops should have body cams for accountability. In the recent case of Mike Brown, we never got to see the interaction between Wilson and Brown which gives us only speculation as to what happened. Yes there was court testimony from both sides but they differed pretty greatly. A body camera on police will give us raw interaction between the two parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will this or can this be used against us? Probably, but it's not like cops are watching us in our houses so I don't understand why it even becomes a matter of privacy violations if we're in public. Cops will probably have the ability to turn off the camera if they want to, but hopefully that will work against them as it obviously shows they are trying to hide something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really think all cops should have body cameras.

       Well, they're not really watching MORE of our moves with police body cameras, are they? Unless you already have police stationed in your bedroom and bathroom. That's the point I don't get about this argument against body cameras, it's not going to mean cops are suddenly going to be in places they're already not. And if they want to go somewhere, our complacent public has already determined they have the right by virtue of being a cop to go there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why not ensure your own safety and the officer's integrity by making him wear a camera that can be accessed by internal affairs and (ideally) the public at large?

       I don't know that I called for all of that. And I am willing to admit that body cams have very high potential to be abused. I'm extra dubious at the chain of recent events and Obama's subsequent 'leadership' announcement on the issue.

      <p>
       I hear your concerns, and I agree 100%. I just know that people have been placed into a position to call for a solution, and it won't be the social revolution we actually need.

       I take your point. It makes sense. However, the aspect I think you're missing is the accountability issue. We have so many examples of clear evidence of police abuse, even video and sound, yet we get acquittals. What's the point of the body cams if we don't also improve the likelihood of criminal cops being held to the law.

       I agree that the body cams are a stopgap with dubious effect. The system as a whole needs to be addressed, but that requires America to turn off it's entertainment and get involved.

       I've argued both points and its really a double edged sword.  I agree with the accountability aspect, and that really falls more on DAs and prosecutors as well..  They're the ones the let things go but you don't see the spotlight on these fucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, we have to look at the police unions that will go to great lengths to protect piece of shit cops and will spend all kinds of money in lawyers fees.  Then the city doesn't want to get into a long legal battle so nothing is ever done.  Sure there will be some scapegoat here and there to show something was done, but the majority of fuckers will get a 2 week paid suspension, or they'll get tipped off about an IA investigation and quit, collect their pension, or will be hired on by a dept in another dept or nearby city.  Sometimes even get hired with backpay in the same dept when it all blows over.

       here is the thing, are cops every held liable? Even when the evidence is right in the face of the people/prosecution, cops get off and get a vacation. So no I don't think giving big brother even more surveillance power is a good idea. As I sit here though, it sure would be funny to hack their cameras and live stream the bullshit they do to MSM without their permission. Just a evil genius thought.

       Here is the main issue with body cameras on police in the current configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier this week, Obama proposed legislation that would appropriate 280+ mil for 50,000 new camera. That's great and everything, but as it is right now, the cameras must be turned on prior to an incident, the data is not secured and can even be edited or deleted locally, thus rendering the device useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not trying to hijack your post, but I'm actually working with a close friend to develop a brand new and exciting app-based technology that we are hopeful will revolutionize how we interact with police during contact with law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're a couple months removed from our first crowdfunding campaign,  which has enabled us to complete phase one of the app's design. Within two weeks, we will be launching our second campaign and we're hopeful we'll raise enough to compete construction of the app.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main idea with the app is about educating users on their rights, while providing an added layer of protection between themselevs and law enforement. Users will be able to chose between just recording audio/video of the incident, (which will be stored securely on remote servers and unable to be tampered with locally), or they will be able do the same thing, but with a licensed/practicing attorney in the session as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting the finishing touches on our re-vamped website before it goes live, but still happy to discuss the idea or timelines a bit more if anyone is interested.

       The thing about evidence in the past is that it was always able to be played as "insufficient" because of camera angles, false witness reports, etc. The body cams give recorded evidence from the perspective of the person in question, making it much more reliable and credible. And it will be able to pick up what all police involved are saying, as well as what the victim is saying/doing, making it less likely that the police will claim resistance.

       Other posters have said this but I will repeat. Cameras and video footage is the only way to curtail police abuse. Filing a complaint against a cop (which in itself is almost impossible, seeing as though they are the ones that take the complaint and review it themselves...and never find fault with themselves) but without video evidence you have NO,ZIP,ZERO chance of prevailing they take the cops word and ignore yours period, proven time and time again. Sadly even with camera footage the system so favors the police they still cannot be brought to justice 99 times out of a hundred.

       I actually made a post yesterday on this same topic. I too think we may be opening a Pandora's box here, and I'm not sure more surveillance of the public is a good thing. Who makes sure the police don't erase their own damning evidence? Who watches the watchmen?

       The police want them. There's quite a few reasons why, but acquiring them is no small cost. Federal mandate and funding cover at least half the cost.

       Fewer defendants will get away on technicality. Police won't be required to testify, the video will be their stand-in, that lowers cost and increases productivity. Claims against police can be substantiated, that's true, but cameras on cops will serve to exonerate the cops in many of those cases where complaints against police are filed. People behave better when they're on camera so police will have fewer confrontations with belligerent citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there the mobile live streaming technology that can put higher-ups at the front of theline in raids and other things like that, like they can do with cameras on combat troops. Cameras provide increased intelligence gathering capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, conviction rates will rise making the return on police labor a better investment for the locality and the prison system. it's no longer your word vs. the cop's word. It's the camera and that's it. Police reports can be written with the benefit of having the video to review. Technical mistakes can be avoided.

       Getting the people to demand this nice piece of technology for their police force is a huge swindle but people are prone to thinking like victims and holding their oppressors to account.

       Amen. Camera footage does not appear to correlate with police accountability - we have a few examples of officers exonerated with clear evidence in just the last week - Eric Garner, Michael Crawford, Tamir Rice. And you know they aren't the only ones.

       I would love to have cameras on every cop. I would love for them to be streamed directly and instantly to the public. I would love for any cop whose camera malfunctions to be immediately removed from whatever situation he is in and forced to return to the station until his camera is back in good working order and for the time his camera is out of commission, for him to be considered the same as any civilian, legally.

       You make an excellent and thought provoking point, but I still think the good outweighs the bad. I think that cameras encourage better behavior on the part of officers and citizens in the vast majority of encounters. And it is that footing that will create an environment where abusive situations have a difficult time getting going in the first place.

       Filmed images are easy to edit in order to create a false version of events.  It wouldn't matter how bad the quality of the editing is either because even now the police are above the law.  The next thing might be laws making it illegal for people to film the police.

       They will not be storing the footage that they capture in perpetuity. I highly doubt that local police departments are willing to spend the kind of money necessary to store (let alone analyze) the video that is collected from every single body camera all of the time. The way I see the data being handled is it only gets stored temporarily, say a couple weeks or a month, and then erased. If there is an incident reported before that time then all relevant footage from said incident gets saved and reviewed. Everything else gets deleted.

       I think they're a decent idea if used properly. The problem is that, as we've seen, even with video evidence of cops in the middle of committing crimes, they just get let off the hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they defacto become tools FOR the police to continue their oppression and brutality, because there is no chance of consequences if they tamper with the camera footage, as we can clearly see already.

       I don't think is a valid argument. Cameras are likely to moderate police malfeasance and aggression, and it will provide evidence of such abuse when it happens. I have had little interaction with the police, but if I was stopped by the police for any reason, I would rather they were recording than not. I don't see how it could harm the interests of people interacting with the police.

       Did you know the arresting officer or and cop during your arrest can only say things in court to discredit your or basically throw you under the bus. But anything you say that would help you they cant are not aloud to say. so would the video the cam takes only be used to discredit and hurt your case? Or will it be used for the better of the worse of the being that was arrested?

       You know why people are afraid of losing their privacy, and being under constant surveillance? Because of those who have power and what they do, and will do, with that knowledge. If there were more transparent governments and well-intentioned individuals with power, we would have nothing to worry about.

       Good angle to argue, however I think the idea is more to corroborate or annihilate the police officers story when something happens that needs to be investigated further.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've wonder myself about the privacy implications, but also about the data itself. Where will it be held? Will it be centralized and shared between other agencies? Will some data be completely public, like the mugshot websites? If data is private and not public, is it encrypted?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its definitely another angle that TPTB will use to gather more intel on people, but luckily this will be mostly with regards to interactions with LEO.
