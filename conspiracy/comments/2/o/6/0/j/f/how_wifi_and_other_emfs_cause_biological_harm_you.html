<blockquote>
<p>Our modern world is an electromagnetic soup filled with pulses, radio frequencies, computer screens, wireless signals, and a host of wearable gadgets that are emitting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Overpowered-Dangers-Electromagnetic-Radiation-about/dp/1609805097/ref=as_sl_pd_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20">damaging radiation.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/10/34-scientific-studies-showing-adverse.html">Peer-reviewed scientific studies</a> have drawn conclusions that should concern us all, but particularly for young children and pregnant women. <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2014/04/government-agencies-battle-over-adverse.html">Government agencies are even doing battle amongst themselves</a> over outdated scientific information that still impacts current regulations.</p>

<p>Yet another credible voice is now sounding the alarm about the pervasive dangers of Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) - Professor Martin Pall, PhD - professor of Biochemistry and Basic Medical Science at Washington State University, Pullman. His lecture can be viewed below, as well as a summary of his findings amid a flood of other scientific research.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Pall&#39;s concerns have been echoed by others throughout the field of biochemistry and health science.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2014/04/neuroscientist-exposes-dangers-of.html">A prominent neuroscientist</a> recently went on record in a lecture to the medical community which gave strong credence to the concerns of everyday citizens. </p>

<p>A world-renown biochemist went as far as to say that wireless radiation is a biohazard and <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2014/05/top-biochemist-calls-to-abolish-smart.html">should be abolished in certain settings.</a> </p>

<p>British ER physician and founder of Physicians&#39; Health Initiative for Radiation and the Environment (PHIRE), Dr. Erica Mallery-Blythe, analyzed the exponential growth of damaging sources of EMFs - damaging to all life, as life could be defined as anything that possesses an electromagnetic field. </p>

<p>She concludes her lecture (<a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2014/11/electromagnetic-radiation-health-and.html">viewed here</a>) with some practical solutions that can be taken to mitigate the effects of bio-active frequencies which can cause disruption of our DNA fractal antenna and promote a host of stress responses.</p>

<p>Professor Pall states unequivocally in his lecture in Oslo, Norway:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;I think this is going to be one of the major issues in the next few years. Most people are not aware of this, and the people who are mostly know the old data – and there’s a lot of new [information] on this that’s extremely, extremely important.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pall shows us how, with an increasing preponderance of so-called ‘smart’ meters, ‘smart’ phones and other microwave-emitting technologies and infrastructure, the health of the public is in danger; that our young are the most at risk and that urgent action to protect people is now required.</p>

<p>Prof. Pall’s extensive research over recent decades into this issue shows that:</p>

<p>Microwaves damage humans at levels far below present radiation limits, through mechanisms at the cellular level.</p>

<p>These biological mechanisms can – completely or partially – be behind growing “unexplained illnesses” like sudden cardiac death, ME, weakened immune system, fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress, and increased DNA breakage, etc.</p>

<p>The effects can, in principle, affect all multicellular animals, and is proven, for example, in mussels (molluscs).</p>

<p>You need neither New Age, tendentious science or conspiracy theories to justify this.</p>

<p>Now is the time to become informed and keep your friends and family up to date on new research that shows the threats some of our new technologies pose to the more vulnerable among us. </p>

<p>How many times do we need to hear the assurances of the scientific establishment that they have covered all bases in advising governments to create health guidelines that later turn out to be woefully inadequate?</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">8</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Nexusty.html">Nexusty</a> 2014-12-03</p>
    <div class="md"><p>You guys do realize that the sun emits radiation, i.e light, of all wavelengths, right? Yes, Microwaves can damage living tissue because it heats it up (does NOT ionize it). Only high energy radiation such as UV, X-rays, Gamma rays, and so on ionize your body. Now that is damaging radiation. However low wavelength radiation is completely harmless. Frick you are currently radiating IR radiation, and you do so the entire time. Radiowaves are constantly passing through your body because of how weak they are. Saying that certain kinds of radiations were not present before technology became prominent is absurd. Everything radiates radiation. Don&#39;t believe me? Look it up.</p>

<p>Also EMFs are dangerous? EMFs literally hold the universe together. Any charged particle, such as an electron or proton, exerts an EMF. Why? Because they are charged with a negtive and positive charge respectively. EMFs are as dangerous as heat for example. If something is room temperatur it won&#39;t hurt you, just like a weak EMF. If something is so hot that it starts to glow then it&#39;ll hurt you, just like a really powerful EMF. Do we have such powerful EMFs on earth? Yea. Are they present in our society and cities? Pretty much no.</p>

<p>Also if you&#39;re THAT paranoid about EMFs then here&#39;s a fun fact. The strength of an EMF changes with respect to distance from it. To be exact it&#39;s proportional to 1/r<sup>2</sup> where &#39;r&#39; is the distance from the EMF. So if you&#39;re 10m from an EMF it&#39;ll be 100 times weaker than at a 1m distance. </p>

<p>This is first year Physics. Heck this is even grade 12 physics. If EMFs and weak radiation are so harmful then how come we have so many Physicts, electricians, and nuclear engineers alive today?</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, there are people who are incredibly educated in their fields. Maybe just because one or a group of people are paranoid about &#39;x&#39; doesn&#39;t mean that they are right. I&#39;ve said this before and I&#39;ll say it again: Scientists are against progress. If you can prove with evidence and research that something is dangerous and it&#39;s threatening society at a huge scale, then you can expect results, further research in the matter, a nobel prize, and whatever else you want. But until then, just remember that just because someone has a Ph.D from a respectable school, doesn&#39;t mean that they know everything. Science wasn&#39;t created by a single person, thankfully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it&#39;s great and all that you give the physics point of view on it, that doesn&#39;t clear you to make comments about what the biological impact is and it especially doesn&#39;t give you credentials to state whether or not that effect is an acceptable risk to humans. Suggesting that scientists aren&#39;t dead as proof is totally incongruent with what the allegation is in the first place. </p>

<p>The problem here is that your forcing a mechanistic model onto everything. You simply cannot do that with medical science. </p>

<p>Well that&#39;s only because the Universe follows a mechanistic model. The fact is, <a href="/u/Nexusty">/u/Nexusty</a> is explaining why radio waves are not harmful to people. Seems to me that you are just ignoring his explanation.</p>

<p>Hence my comment,  either you do the experiment with a control group that&#39;s based in the middle of the wilderness,  and somehow at the same time provide them with a diet and lifestyle similar to the groups being exposed to the EMF transmitters we encounter in our lives.... Or you put the control group in mobile Faraday cages for their lives from the moment of birth to the end of the experiment to eliminate environmental variables. </p>
