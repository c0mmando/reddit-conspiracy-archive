       I believe the Zombie apocalypse is predictive programming for a race war in which the food supply is cut off, possibly along with a disease outbreak (Ebola?), causing large numbers of minorities who have been convinced by the mainstream (Jewish) media that whites are the source of all their problems, to slaughter whites en masse, first in the cities, then in the countryside as they expand out from the large cities, just as the zombie movies predict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews and the rest of the "elite" see whites who are not part of their clan as a grave threat to their New World Order, and this manufactured race war will cull the white population significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media promotes black racial hatred of whites, which is why they pushed the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown stories, movies like Django Unchained, and the propaganda we are subjected to in schools which convinces us that the history of slavery is evil white men subjecting black men to slavery, when in fact it slavery was largely a Jewish and "elite" white phenomenon, and many slaves were white. The common white man's ancestors are not responsible for slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Already today we see the results of this campaign of racial hatred, as there is an epidemic of racial hate crimes by blacks against whites, going unreported in the mainstream media. This includes the numerous beatings, murders, and rapes of white people, such as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Channon_Christian_and_Christopher_Newsom">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Channon_Christian_and_Christopher_Newsom
       </a>
       , which are largely ignored in the mainstream Jewish media. You can bet your booty if the races were reversed this story would be infamous. It is also why almost all rape in prison is a black-against-white racially motivated hate crime:
       <a href="http://www.justdetention.org/pdf/knowles2.pdf">
        http://www.justdetention.org/pdf/knowles2.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They want their race war. The only question is whether blacks and other minorities who hate whites, and to a lesser extent whites who hate blacks and minorities, will give them what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this will be seen as being "racist" and "divisive," but I do believe it to be a very real possibility. What I'd really like to see is blacks, whites, and other ethnicities to realize once and for all that the "elite" are the real enemy, to band together against them in solidarity. But even so, if they starve us it will be dog eat dog no matter what. Most people will do just about anything to eat when they're starving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that (Jewish) Monsanto and similar organizations aim to control the world food supply, and consider that the same group of "elites" behind the Bolshevik Revolution, Mao's China, and the treatment of German POWs after WW2, used starvation as their primary tool to murder millions. They WILL do it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of WHEN they will implement this plan is important. It would probably be during or after World War 3, as they will wait to murder us en masse until AFTER we've fought their war for Israel and the New World Order for them.

       Obviously that's not what I said. The media and educational system have created a system where a great number of minorities are racist against white people. Meanwhile whites are taught to be anti-racist. The net result is indeed that minorities will be more racist against whites than whites are against minorities, on average. This is reflected in the prison rape statistics, which are almost entirely black-on-white racially motivated hate crimes. It is also important to note that the vast majority of racial hate crimes in general are committed by "minorities" against whites. Not vice versa, as the media would have you believe since they only focus on white racial hate crimes. So the evidence proves my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that it really matters who's "more racist". The racial division exists and it is certain that whites will become less and less enthusiastic about non-whites as time goes on, as the natural results of multiculturalism bear fruit and tensions increase.

       I agree with many points in your post. Regarding the educational system, in my experience in the public school system it seemed like every single year they would push literature relating to slavery. Straight through elementary school to high school they pushed it, got old really quick. Didn't matter if it was history or english class, it always came up somehow.

       I bet they never mentioned white slavery or the overwhelming Jewish role in African slavery:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In contrast to the benevolent image assigned to them by the media, Jews historically dominated an international institution that embodied the darkest evils of human exploitation: the slave trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, the closest thing that approximates the ancient slave trade in the present day is the White slave trade (prostitution) including the forced abasement and torture of hundreds of thousands of Eastern European women. As readers of the David Duke Report are aware, this nefarious activity is almost completely controlled by Jews and much of it is based in Israel. But somehow the Jews get no bad press from this. Again, it really is not difficult to understand when one understands who controls the press.

       No, according to these "educators", slavery was an evil committed solely by white men exclusively against blacks.

       What's up with the fervent antisemitism (Jew-bashing)? I'm all for conspiracy theories (many, not all), but Jews programming people for a race war? Pretty sure as a small-ish minority, Jews would get fucked again in a race war- just like the last time.

       I always saw the Zombie Apocalypse as a metaphor for real life struggle.  There are those who just walk around in a daze, consuming like good little consumers.  Those who fight the system of consuming and essentially doing what you are told like a zombie, are outcasts that are forced to live outside the norm, outside of regular society, or else risk being "bitten" and becoming a zombie.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effort of killing and exterminating zombies can be viewed as either fighting ignorance, or shedding friendship and family relationships of those who would drag you into the zombie hordes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, in WWZ, the people ultimately win.  There are pockets of consumerism that pop up from time to time, but they are quickly exterminated because people still remember when it was at its worst.  But people also know that their children will become complacent again one day and they may again have to fight the good fight be that revolution or in the dregs of the people minds.

       I think its less race and more of an easy target to divide people. It's easy to use diversity to have people stop thinking about what we have in common, especially with regards to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.

       It's not in TPTB's best interests to have a well educated, well funded, and unified citizen front to attempt to continue the Ponzi scheme of the Fed Reserve and the decent into tyranny.

       There's nothing wrong with acknowledging racial differences, which are quite obviously real. Racial slurs like "cracker" and "nigger", on the other hand, have debatable worth. I'm not actually saying they shouldn't be used.

       Since as an individual one will only ever be able to interact with other individuals, the "racial differences" derived by considering the abstraction of race will never be more than be dubious at best, but will be calamitous at worst.

       I deny the "obvious" reality of racial differences. I further deny any of the pronouncements derived from such considerations as groundless.

       Ha, so that is a representative example of your "facts"? I've never yet met a person with white skin, definitely various shades of peach, but no white yet. I haven't met anyone with black skin, definitely deep shades of brown, but no black yet. I also wonder if your method may suffer from
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias#Sampling_bias">
        this

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, what happens if I take extremely pale populations from rural appalachian mountain towns (literacy rates hovering in the high 70s) and put them against the extremely dark populations of Zimbabwe (literacy rates in the 90%) in a no holds barred literacy test? Do you think the innate racial difference between "whites" and "blacks" will somehow overcome the vastly more prevalent social and economic considerations that create the divide between these two populations literacy rate?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, lets go one further. What is IQ? I know its measured by IQ tests, but what is it? What is being measured? The ability to solve spatial and word puzzles? Do you really think a statistical correlation between pigmentation and ability to solve word problems is meaningful? Can you imagine, amidst all that you must know to so keenly intuit reality, that there could be other factors at play that absolutely dwarf any potential contribution from non-melenation?
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter. I am going to deny your reality in any event. You have revealed yourself to be small-minded on this topic. You are primed for  what's coming and will be as jackbooted as all the rest when it is bidden to be so. Enjoy watching your society split down the middle!

       Uh OBVIOUSLY literacy is social so lets ignore that.
      </p>
      <p>
       IQ does not equal intelligence but there are tests for intelligence. That literate african americans do worse on neutral (or biased in their favor) iq tests makes it pretty obcious blacks are not as intelligent as whites on avg. So does the fact that whites excel even tho they dont have the advantages jews do with their tribalism. Even despite racist affirmative action blacks still fall short.

       Actually, you're saying race is just a skin color:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Take a (sufficiently large) group of people with white skin. Take a (sufficiently large) group of people with black skin.

      <p>
       It just happens to be an extremely important skin color in your myopic world view. Those poor dumb blacks. But at least you don't call them niggers, right?

       Leftism is denial of reality, including denial that there are natural differences between people based on race, sex, etc. Leftism says we are all equal despite the fact we are not. Leftism wants to force equal outcomes because it assumes only discrimination can account for varied outcomes, since we are all equal.

       Ha, so that is a representative example of your "facts"? I've never yet met a person with white skin, definitely various shades of peach, but no white yet. I haven't met anyone with black skin, definitely deep shades of brown, but no black yet. I also wonder if your method may suffer from
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias#Sampling_bias">
        this
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, what happens if I take extremely pale populations from rural appalachian mountain towns (literacy rates hovering in the high 70s) and put them against the extremely dark populations of Zimbabwe (literacy rates in the 90%) in a no holds barred literacy test? Do you think the innate racial difference between "whites" and "blacks" will somehow overcome the vastly more prevalent social and economic considerations that create the divide between these two populations literacy rate?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, lets go one further. What is IQ? I know its measured by IQ tests, but what is it? What is being measured? The ability to solve spatial and word puzzles? Do you really think a statistical correlation between pigmentation and ability to solve word problems is meaningful? Can you imagine, amidst all that you must know to so keenly intuit reality, that there could be other factors at play that absolutely dwarf any potential contribution from non-melenation?
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter. I am going to deny your reality in any event. You have revealed yourself to be small-minded on this topic. You are primed for  what's coming and will be as jackbooted as all the rest when it is bidden to be so. Enjoy watching your society split down the middle! Your hometown is gonna look just like this place in a little bit:

       I agree with many points in your post. Regarding the educational system, in my experience in the public school system it seemed like every single year they would push literature relating to slavery. Straight through elementary school to high school they pushed it, got old really quick. Didn't matter if it was history or english class, it always came up somehow.
