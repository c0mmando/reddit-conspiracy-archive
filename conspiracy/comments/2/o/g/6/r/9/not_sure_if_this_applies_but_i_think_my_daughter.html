    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the creation myth isn&#39;t a myth?  Since anatomical  mankind as we know it today showed up over 200k years ago but every man and woman today are decendants of only one man and woman who can only be traced back 60k years ago, this is a mystery no one has been able to explain.  </p>

<p>This first woman and first man are the same age and are commonly known as Scientific Adam and Scientific Eve.  We lived along side with the other humans for a very long time, but then something happened where all humans today only decended from that one Scientific Adam and Scientific Eve,  the odds that this can happen are astronomical.   </p>

<p>Perhaps the stories we contribute to early man as myth is, in reality, man retelling their own linage.  The missing link isn&#39;t anatomical in nature but the concept of when man made that huge jump in intellectual thought where they stopped reacting to their envirnoment as instinct and began applying reason,  solutions to problems,  Earlier than 60k years ago we lived and thought like the other humans.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dinosaurs and the fossil record both support a Biblical account... The fact that fossils even exists in the strata the way they do testifies to a global flood. The evidence doesn&#39;t support millions of years and this is a known fact. The arguments for darwinism are based on circular reasoning. They date the rocks with the fossils and the fossils with the theory of evolution, and all of the dates that they use were established arbitrarily long ago.</p>

<p>As for dinosaurs... soft tissue has been found in fossils showing that they are not millions of years old and rather recent. There is much evidence that dinosaurs walked with man and not only that, man killed off these dragons because they were threatening.</p>

<p>There is much, much evidence for the Biblical account which is what swayed me over... not because I believed my whole life but because I made a critical assessment. You&#39;re speaking out of ignorance without even knowing the case for the opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I&#39;m arguing two things. One: we already have the answer. Two: The textbook answers are proven wrong.</p>

<p>The evidence we have here on Earth is already explained in the Biblical account without all the ridiculous chance hypotheses and deep time nonsense which have no proof. We have an account that is testable and verifiable which covers all the bases for everything we observe - catastrophism, the fossil record, life and speciation, genetics, astronomy, etc... All the pieces are put together for us already without having to speculate or just assume that this universe out of an infinite number of universes somehow won the lottery every day a billion years in a row, which still doesn&#39;t explain the spiritual aspects of our existence that exist outside of the material realm. The laws of logic are supernatural, for instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>true enough, now most of these SCIENCE!<sup>TM</sup> types are under the deluded belief that Big Bang Creationism isn&#39;t Creationism. There is also the issue with a flat out rejection of Catastrophism which is quite ridiculous.</p>

<p>But while you&#39;re alive what better way to spend your time than exploring the mysteries of the Universe?  Now, Darwinian Evolution in the currently accepted time frame is total nonsense. We have the spontaneous generation of a single-celled organism containing and passing down the entire DNA and genetic sequencing and epigenetic modes for the entire tree of life. Darwinian Evolution originating on Earth is total bullshit. On this we can both agree - and those people who support the idea do so on ignorance and faith and certainly not science.</p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t see this as evidence for the Biblical account, which is in reality an Sumerian re-telling. What translation? If Textbooks are wrong, I can simply proclaim the Bible to be another incorrect textbook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t prove spontaneous generation of a single celled organism. We can&#39;t do it in a lab, let alone hope it would happen by accident. It&#39;s not possible. Even if that&#39;s a given, next problem arises that a single celled organism can never be anything else but a single celled organism.

<p>Science has shown we can&#39;t exist without intelligence behind our creation. It couldn&#39;t be just aliens, because they would also need an origin somewhere. It must be an eternal omnipotent all-powerful God.</p>

<p>The evidence for the Biblical account is in the historical details. The flood telling is accurate, people and places are confirmed accurate, and even prophecy has been shown to be accurate at thousands of years prediction spans. Nothing in the Bible has been disproven ever. The only thing that leads to rejection is the supernatural aspects of it, but there&#39;s no reason to believe these couldn&#39;t be true. God left us His word for a reason which He explains in Revelation and all through the Bible.</p>

<p>I know in my heart the truth. Anyone who wants to know the truth and seeks with all their heart will find it. I don&#39;t trust anything any person says, but the Bible? That&#39;s something I can proudly stand on. God leaves nothing out.</p>
