       ...or its that Israel is a nuclear country which has survived for 60 years in spite of anything its neighbors threw at it.   Its in a constant state of readiness, with a well-trained military that will need all the power you can muster to overthrow.   It is, however, currently distracted by other interests and won't directly attack until threatened.   Best to try and steer clear until later, while keeping an eye out for spies.
      </p>

       It makes good sense to avoid it.  But no, let's go with the "blame Israel for absolutely everything " theory.

       Can I blame Israel for defrauding our politicians to get at American tax money?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I blame Israel for enjoying a standard of living off of the backs of Americans that most of America can only dream of?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about blaming Israel for totally subverting our election process by repatriating American tax dollars in the form of campaign donations to candidates who will obviously put Israel first before Americans?

       ISIS not only built it's own refineries (and media production studios!) after sweeping soverign nations, they were allowed to announce to world media that they will be issuing a non-petrodollar currency. And then.... nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       This alone should be a smoking gun that ISIS is controlled opposition to anyone paying even an MSM level of attention. If you're not sure why, ask Saddam and Gaddafi about it.

       ISIS 'beheaded' fake personas, the real people behind those fake identitys go back to being their original person, or they take up other fake identities.

       just to take the case of the British taxi driver into account, ignoring the others, the idea that the British govt would ignore and/or allow a British subject to go work for an Islamic charity and make multiple trips between the UK and Syria is laughable. he would have been arrested at the airport and questioned the first time he arrived back in the UK, or even before leaving.
      </p>
      <p>
       the taxi driver was either a UK/Israeli spy and/or a faked ID.
      </p>
      <p>
       the US has jailed Americans and residents for working for overseas Islamic charities also.

       They are working their way outward in a strategic way. Consolidating their gains, and trying to strengthen their position before adding another opponent into the mix. Expect them to be careful not to step on too many toes in Israel and even do things that Israel doesn't mind (taking out Assad and Iran and so on - the enemy of my enemy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel has a productive practical relationship

       with Saudi Arabia, so it's not really that Israel is hated by all Arab states (it's a gross generalization to say all Muslim terrorist groups are the same in their relationship with Israel), and Daesh is less of a threat to them than Syria or Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of the terrorists as geopolitical strategists rather than religious fundamentalists (like the media and propaganda want you to believe).
      </p>
      <p>
       They are doing things for strategic reasons aimed at A) draining the US economy and weakening the already declining US to the point where they are unable to afford to get involved in the ME, and B) establishing a Caliphate which necessarily requires them to gain the support of the people through some means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attacking Israel is not necessary to the establishment of a full state with an air force and they realize they don't stand a chance of beating Israel until they have Saudi Arabia and the USA on their side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect they will stay brutal long enough to get established, then their leader will die in a drone strike or something and the new leader will be a more moderate (because they will have a proper looking army and government structure). One that the United States can justify helping to take out Syria and Iran. By that point the US will be completely broke and probably collapse into civil war itself though.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        footnote:
       </strong>
       This means that I think Israel is helping ISIS - they and the USA both already work with Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia pays the bills). Saudi Arabia and Israel are America's two strongest allies in the region. The Islamic Caliphate is a perfect way, if successful for Saudi Arabia to increase their influence in the region and grab onto some additional oil resources. I think the USA, CIA, MOSSAD, whatever are all actively arming training and funding IS with the assistance of Saudi Arabia.

       You assume they built themselves out of thin air on their own... rather unlikely, at the very least they had western consent, but most likely the full support, through both financing/arming and wars. To me, they are geopolitical strategic assets (because they are religious fundamentalists from a violent version of Islam forced upon them via oriented petrodollars funding over the last few decades), certainly not geopolitical strategists. NOT attacking Israel is necessary to the establishment of a full state with an air force....

       Yes, belonging to the people who control the oil (USA / Saudi Arabia). ISIS has the same ideological and religious beliefs as Saudi Arabia - I would argue (and so would people like Osama bin Laden) that the Saudi regime is corrupt even from their own ideological point of view (in the same way as we know the CIA is a perversion of western liberal democracy, the house of Saud is a perversion of the ideal of an Islamic Caliphate) .
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing separating ISIS from fully absorbing Saudi is a well timed (and probably overdue) popular revolt. This could be triggered by a sudden loss of oil revenues leading to the inability of the Saudi government to provide bread and circuses for their people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also why the USA considers regime continuity of the house of Saud to be a matter of National Security for the United States, and the NSA helps the Saudis hunt down and behead or crucify political dissidents and pro democracy activists.

       This gets posted weekly. The implication is that Israel controls ISIS. The reality is that ISIS has repeatedly made anti-Israel threats and statements but is not attacking Israel due to geographic reasons (as well as the fact that they'd get fucking annihilated if they tried).
