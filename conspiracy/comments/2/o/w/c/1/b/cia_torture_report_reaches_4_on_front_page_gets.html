    <div class="md"><p>Oh, please. It was dead long before then. it was fading when the AMA sub was created. </p>

<p>really, while I know it was critical to the growth, the subreddit concept is really what killed it -- it&#39;s the same moderator problem that every big forum eventually has. the &quot;general interest&quot; section gets too busy, so you let them create small, isolated communities. you just end up with a bunch of echo chamber shit. you don&#39;t like that there are jokes at the expense of women? create SRS. Don&#39;t like SRS? Create tumblrinaction or srssucks or sjsucks or . Don&#39;t like that D/R political parties get all the coverage? create the Libertarian sub. Don&#39;t like that christians are the butt of jokes? Create an athiest subreddit, then banish it. </p>

<p>All dissenting opinion disappears, and people think their little thing is actually important. And now we&#39;re in a world where reddit makes fun of &quot;poor bullied virgin neckbeard whites&quot; on the regular, where GamerGate support is directed at the aggressors, and where you can get banned from default subs just for disagreeing with the moderators. </p>

<p>Reddit is crushing itself under its own weight. Almost guaranteed is the regression to the mean, where all we really see are cat pictures and &quot;stuff my girlfriend made.&quot; Reddit used to be a unique forum that a few people self-selected into. Now it&#39;s a generic massive website that hosts millions of tiny forums. And with that comes the influx of generic users, who use it &quot;because it&#39;s popular&quot; or &quot;because I want to be on the front page&quot; or &quot;because I want karma&quot; or whatever. Because that&#39;s what most people find non-offensive. Add in that being &quot;nerd&quot; is trendy now, and reddit really deludes itself into thinking every member is some sort of nerd, and it&#39;s a perfect storm. </p>

<p>Plus, the alternatives aren&#39;t really good yet. The one and only thing reddit has going for it is the large user base, the same thing that&#39;s destroying it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. That was such a perfect move. Its amazing how they shamed millions of people and an entire website for the acts of probably a handful of people (who may have even intentionally spread the misinformation).</p>

<p>Shaming a community of millions for trying to solve a mystery is like trying to shame us for posting when a disaster strikes and the powers of the community work quicker and more effective than any news report or emergency team.</p>

<p>The most amazing thing is that at the end of the day, the government just showed us a picture of 2 guys attending the Boston Marathon and said &quot;here&#39;s your proof&quot;.</p>

<p>Thats it. A picture proving they were there. And that was enough for a nation of 300 million and an entire world of foreign spectators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the truth is, that most people in America are still doing pretty well. Sure they used to do a hell of a lot better, and the middle class and labor have been thoroughly screwed the past 30 years, but even if you are poor in America, it still beats the hell out of the developing world. People may be struggling too much to be effective in political mobilization, but they also aren&#39;t so destitute or desperate to be rioting in the streets. We are starting to see that change, but it is still on the grand scheme of things VERY limited. Even protests of hundreds of thousands are still small fraction of this large nation.  </p>

<p>Personally I believe there are many true conspiracies, but not everything is a conspiracy. Meaning that sometimes rather small conspiracies can have rather huge results, and there is so many people and organizations out there with the motive that people take comfort in blaming governments, corporations, or international organizations of one sort or another as the primary cause because the alternative, in that we live a world of billions of people, all with different agendas and sources of different powers that nobody is in control and shitty things can happen because of a mistake, miscommunication, accident, or the conspiracy of a small actor to goad a large actor into some action. </p>

<p>When it comes to something say like the war in Syria, clearly nobody is calling the shots. It&#39;s a fucking disaster for pretty much everyone. Sure there are idiots on the ground part of some idiotic redneck death cult who love the apocalypse, and it looked pretty good from Washington until ISIS went and blew the last of their credibility on Iraq to hell. There are so many different groups with so many different agendas trying to play their part, that nobody could have planned out the way it has gone since this war started, and if any side did they&#39;ve be stupid to do it the way they did. Now at this point you may wonder why I&quot;ve gone off on Syria. Well frankly it is because we need to point to something to show not everything is a conspiracy. You may yourself be a reasonable person who accepts this argument and thinks it is silly to bring up. Well not everyone is as reasonable as you and some will dispute this. If you agree with me, you will realize how impossible it may be to dissuade someone of this heartfelt conspiracy. Now if you are like me, you may be convinced that some organization has orchestrated the whole event, but that would require new substantial evidence.  </p>

<p>Anyways my point is that people have it good, and a revolution is risky business. Liberal secularists in Iran thought revolution would get them free of their dictator. The Iranian regime may not be the caricature the west portrays, but if you are transported back as a woman to 1970s Iran you&#39;d still find it preferable than the modern day. Sure you&#39;d be in a country that is torturing people, but that probably isn&#39;t a change.  </p>

Educating yourself and turning it into political action is difficult and sometimes dangerous work. And it is work, if you want to do it right. Watching television is a passive experience. When you&#39;re expending your energy trying to survive, it&#39;s easier to sit down and watch the Walking Dead than march on the state house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, the real decline was the removal of <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a></p>

<p>Every other sub had a drop in quality once there wasn&#39;t a catch-all sub was removed. This made the &quot;Hard&quot; articles get watered down as the not casual and easily suggested general topics were forced to classify their posts under another sub. So new people joining ever since have seen more easily digestible content going into each sub and naturally upvote it more quickly and easily and when they think of submissions for themselves, will also submit similarly easy to digest content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a problem with whoaverse is the domain sounds like a stoned 12 year old came up with the it. Bear with me now. That, and it&#39;s an exact clone of reddit. Back when reddit wasn&#39;t huge and you first found it, it was like &quot;the hell is this? Another forum? The hell are these people talking about, the fuck is a reddit?&quot; Then you HAD to read the rules before you made an account and you realized how important and unique the site was.</p>

<p>It was provactive and merry and nerdy and a huge dash of obscure. </p>

<p>I mean granted due to sites like reddit and 4chan and whatnot we are kind of desensitized to alot of material. We&#39;re older now.  It&#39;s not always a universe of &quot;whoa&quot;. </p>

<p>but that doesn&#39;t mean you still can&#39;t craft a new site, with even a moral objective and have a close tight knit group or even clique where people can speak easy. Start small, get an irc channel(it&#39;s free) and if you&#39;ve got cool people it will grow</p>

<p>Maybe it is a good thing. Maybe it is best if it doesn&#39;t get too big. Isn&#39;t that partly why reddit has become so poor? I&#39;m not arguing - you make good points. Just &#39;thinking out loud&#39;. Thanks.</p>

<p>Maybe think of it more like a social club. You <em>could</em> just be attracting the wrong group of folks. Or maybe its not that you&#39;re attracting the wrong group, but more like you&#39;re <em>not</em> attracting the right group. Does that make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no?  Let&#39;s try to remember something, as painful as this may be....this site belongs to someone, and that person gets to decide how the site is run.  We all choose to participate, understanding that immutable truth.</p>

<p>Reddit was once a truly epic place, where one was able to dive into discussion with both like minded and opposed individual; who were thoughtful, intelligent, and who all had something to contribute.  But that time has come to an end.  There is still utility in that many people congregate here, and in spite of up/down votes that don&#39;t mesh with objective reality, a message can still get out.</p>

<p>Submissions like this are important.  Kudos to the OP.  Messages like this make other information more palatable, in spite of the censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These moderators are such a joke. </p>

<p>I got banned for posting &quot;news analysis&quot; to the world news site. It wasn&#39;t anything controversial: the story was about how cities in EU like Paris are going to start banning diesel engines to comply with EU air regulations. </p>

<p>I truly thought the story I posted was &quot;news&quot; without much &quot;analysis&quot; but, whatever. </p>

<p>I engaged the mod and asked him if he actually read the article. He never answered that question but said no &quot;analysis&quot; and so on and no &quot;reportage.&quot; </p>

<p>I responded with the Webster&#39;s definition of the word &quot;reportage&quot; -- which is basically, you know, factual reporting? -- and he said, basically, &quot;my bad, I&#39;m not an native English speaker&quot; so he didn&#39;t really understand that word correctly. So, forget that he said &quot;reportage&quot; violates their &quot;rules&quot; and will get you banned. </p>

<p>Huh? He is moderating the world news site. Banning people for posting news stories with too much &quot;analysis.&quot; And he&#39;s not a native English speaker? I don&#39;t have any problems with non-English natives but he&#39;s trying to read in English, apply these ridiculous distinctions and he doesn&#39;t even know what the word &quot;reportage&quot; means? </p>

<p>He thinks its something that will get you banned. It&#39;s insane.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are trying to distinguish between &quot;news&quot; and &quot;news analysis&quot; which is absurd given the movement in modern journalism to blur the line between the two. Plus, don&#39;t we want journalists to actually tell us what something means, rather than just parrot that there&#39;s two sides to every issue, like they do here in the U.S.? </p>

<p>For example, I always say the American press would report a story like this: </p>

<p>Today, the Republicans announced the Moon is really made of green cheese. The Democrats responded that it is not and this demonstrates the anti-science nature of Republicans. </p>

<p>And nowhere would the story say: And in fact, the Moon is NOT made of green cheese. Because that would be &quot;analysis.&quot;  You know, why should a news story be concerned with &quot;the truth&quot; or &quot;facts&quot;? </p>

<p>So, one side or the other gets to lie with impunity about anything: global warming, historical facts, you name it -- and the story is always a &quot;he said, she said&quot; bit of nonsense. </p>

<p>So the Reddit world news sub is punishing good journalism. </p>

<p>From what I understand, the business model of Uber is that it asks individuals to drive their own cars + pay for their own gasoline to transport people from point A to point B. It&#39;s a shitty business model because it&#39;s designed for failure based upon the fact that the &quot;salary&quot; (if you&#39;d call intermittent cash flow) of the drivers are GREATLY outpaced by the deprecation of the automobile and gasoline prices. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t quite understand how it&#39;s affecting other businesses, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The removal of powerful cab companies from the mix of being taxis that is revolutionary - the ease by which a person can hail an Uber with a app and have control over their own driving that is causing the problems for the larger cab companies - cabbie tokens in NYC for example can go for 600k for a TLC license.  (<a href="http://www.ehow.com/info_8620636_much-cab-driver-new-york.html">http://www.ehow.com/info_8620636_much-cab-driver-new-york.html</a>) </p>

<p>Ubers cost model is MUCH less regulated and is a direct competitor to these interests.  Thus any bad press for the Uber program is good for the cabbies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re kidding or not.</p>

<p>Uber is disruptive because it&#39;s pushing the taxi in a way that it should be going. My understand is the taxi industry has become almost a complacent mob. Prior to Uber you need to be certified and find a large company to work for. Driving for yourself was simply unfeasible and driving for someone else meant a lot of your money went to a big company.</p>

<p>Uber highlights the fact that this system is archaic and outdated. It shows that so many people are willing to drive someone around to make a couple of extra bucks.  It&#39;s extremely easy and you can do it whenever you want. No bureaucratic bullshit, no mobs, and more importantly you can work for yourself pretty much whenever and wherever you want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did you think I was kidding?</p>

<p>I understand the entrepreneurial spirit Uber is trying to push but it doesn&#39;t make economic sense to the casual driver. I&#39;ve already touched on this.</p>

<p>To the consumer, it makes sense. But, this business model is shit for the drivers. More on this later. </p>

<p><a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4698299">This is an interesting POV from one of Ubers drivers</a>.</p>

<p>Nearly the exact same thing happens with Uber as it does with regular cab drivers but likely in higher numbers due to a lack of oversight - client poaching, over-saturated areas, etc. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a good <em>idea</em> but Uber, currently, doesn&#39;t seem to be equipped to handle the demands of the cab industry. This leaves them highly vulnerable to losing a market footing and thus being left in the wake of a competitors successes. </p>

<p>I&#39;m genuinely interested to see who wins this battle but I highly doubt we&#39;ll see massive regulatory overhaul in the NYC / Chicago / LA markets for a while. Companies like Uber need to prove themselves worthy of handling the torch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uber&#39;s business model is very disruptive to taxi companies.  My understanding is that most large cities regulate the number of taxi&#39;s allowed to operate within a city/area.  Many cities use a medallion system or something similar in which medallions  can be purchased that give the owner of the medallion the right to operate a taxi within the city (or a set number of taxis).  There are two basic idea&#39;s behind the medallion system: one is to limit the number of taxi&#39;s so that there are enough fares per taxi for it to economically worth while for the taxi drivers, and secondly as a way to impose safety and other types of regulations, such as how much to charge, on the taxi&#39;s/taxi drivers.  In places such as new york, these medallions have come to be worth lots of money (supposedly up to a million dollars according to a Google search).</p>

<p>The way that Uber and similar companies are operating sidesteps the medallion system (removing a major expense), as well as the other regulations (how much to charge, ect.).  The way that you are able to easily find an Uber car using your phone is also an advantage over trying to flag down a taxi.</p>

<p>Admittedly I&#39;m not familiar with the exact economics of income for the Uber drivers vs expenses such as depreciation of their car, but in many other respects I view Uber and other similar companies as having made the changes that the consumer has been hoping for (sometimes unknowingly) from the current way that taxi&#39;s operate.  Now there are ways to avoid filthy cars/drivers, the method of calling/flagging an uber car is easier than a taxi, and it reduces the value of taxi medallions which are often owned by wealthy people who charge a taxi driver to operate under their medallion (not a system I support).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is because nobody cares. They plug a story about terrorists getting tortured and no one really bats an eye at it. Most people will think they got what they deserved not knowing anything about those being tortured. It&#39;s almost a fluff piece and they know it has little impact so they run it. Everyone already knew about torture and the CIA.</p>

<p>If they ran a real story about the CIA, something that would hit home with Americans (tax payers), then there might have to be some actual change and that would hurt the CIA and save the average citizen money. This approach to the CIA is so that they don&#39;t actually have to do anything because torture is already a crime, and they can distract the nation with something trivial at this point in time when the US is currently bombing oil refineries, sabotaging democratic elections and funding terrorists overseas to fight Russian influence in the East.</p>

<p>this came as news to no one in scandinavia, we never expected more from USA and we&#39;re never proven wrong by expecting the worst of it.</p>

<p>Countries in their infancy are apparently as much of a joke now as we were a thousand years ago. Seems like kids who need to prove themselves or something, flex muscles, a bully before growing up, etc etc.</p>

<p>Just think we should be able to expect more from a country in 2014 than we did in the 1500s, USA proves me wrong.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people are pro-Putin more against the anti-Russian circle jerk and the fact everything is painted black and white - Ukraine=good, Russia=bad. That&#39;s what people are against. This doesn&#39;t mean people are pro-Putin. Similarly how often do we hear about the Russian-speaking civilians being killed in Ukraine by the Ukrainian forces and pro-government militias? Never. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like that RT covers a lot of stories that the MSM won&#39;t touch too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russia Today has excellent journalists and is generally great on what it covers. It falls down not on what it covers but what is chooses not to cover. Could say the same about the BBC although its coverage of things like Gaza and Ukraine is just old-fashioned biased reporting. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Are you referring to Crimea? Attacks generally involve use of weapons. You know, like when the US invades countries by bombing them into the Stone age? Russia didn&#39;t attack Crimea. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t the &#39;bad guys&#39; who suffer or even fight. It is the innocent civilians caught up in the mess that suffer. Even most soldiers involved aren&#39;t usually &#39;bad guys&#39; they are just there because they need work or have been forced to fight. The bad guys don&#39;t fight. They sit in safety and count their blood-soaked cash. I&#39;m speaking in simplistic terms obviously but this applies to almost all wars.</p>

Perhaps worse than German concentration camps. Not to mention a multitude of smaller crimes of murder. </p>

<p>Not sure what this post complains about. Trending posts get deleted all the time- even from major subreddits.</p>

<p>In <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>, for example, almost daily do you see a trending post get deleted for not adhering to the rules. Mods are pretty good at their jobs, but not perfect.</p>

<p>Ask yourself that question, not me. What is more simple, that a link to a shitty website gets deleted for breaking the rules of a sub? Or that everything that happens on reddit is because of secret government propagandists disguised as reddit employees? Again, you tell me. If you really believe number two is the more likely one, you need help, bra.</p>

<p>If even a fraction of it were true, then we have done something disgusting as a country.</p>

<p>One CNN commentary stated there was &quot;nothing done to the prisoners that hasn&#39;t been done to our own soldiers.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In the military, you have sleep deprivation, forced marches, and you probably will be gassed at least once (while training with the use of a gas mask), but never... <strong>never</strong> are they going to puree your food and shove it up your ass.</p>

<p>That is the one that really got me. And it wasn&#39;t the only very problematic part of this report.</p>

<p>Hanging prisoners by their arms, dragging them naked down a hallway?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen countless comments comparing it to pouring water over someone&#39;s head.</p>

<p>They just don&#39;t get it. Waterboarding literally short-circuits a part of your brain into thinking it is drowning. This is a technique of torture that needed modern scientist and extensive research to even come into creation.</p>

<p>As far as you are concerned. You ARE drowning. It is a mind-trick, but you cannot fool your own mind, it is in control of you.</p>

<p>And hear this part clearly, your brain triggers that you ARE drowning. Not the few moments before drowning where your mind is panicking and thinking &quot;holy shit, I need to breathe or I will drown&quot;, past that part. You are drowning. That is the part you are experiencing. The actual dying. As far as your brain is concerned. </p>

<p>It took some <em>evil</em> motherfuckers to even research and come up with waterboarding.</p>

<p>Or are you saying that it is just as bad as cutting off a child&#39;s testicles in front of his father?</p>

<p>Edit for a shower thought - I will agree with you on one point. Waterboarding is probably ineffective, for two reasons... Either the subject tells anything the interrogator wants to hear (including false information that sounds right), or he is not affected by the technique and stays quiet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying that even if the the site did contain &quot;malware&quot;, that was just a convenient truth that allowed them to take it down, however....</p>

<p>it was not even taken down for that, according to the comment section of r/undelete, the article was deleted for being <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2ovadv/424861313_cia_torture_report_china_north_korea/cmqvfz8">opinion/analysis</a>.</p>

<p>And my point is that thousands of articles reach and stay on the front page even though they could be flagged for this same offense. The people in charge of the subreddit are picking and choosing how they enforce the rules and by watching that, a pattern emerges, a clear bias that always favors the US government. </p>

<p>The same opinion articles reach the front page about Putin or Islam, and all of a sudden nobody seems to care about rules being broken.</p>

<p>EDIT: I repeat, NOT DELETED. Follow the link from the undelete subreddit and the post is still there, still active. It does NOT have the &lt;deleted&gt; tag that posts get when they are actually deleted. The post simple moved out of rotation after 8-10 hours, ya know, like all posts do in popular subreddits.</p>

<p>It may have lost its front page status, but most posts do within 8 hours, especially on a top subreddit. Its only on small subreddits that dont get many submissions that posts stay &quot;#1&quot;.</p>

<p>I dont see any &quot;conspiracy&quot; here at all. Its unsufferable, the amount of &quot;zomg, they deleted a post, conspiracy man&quot; here. How can i possible give credence to &quot;real content&quot; here, when half od the posts here sound like whiny children complaining in kindergarten. </p>

<p>So, <strong>I followed the links to the original submittion</strong> and it was not deleted.</p>

<p>Yes, so did I. The link is in the body of my post. <strong>A link that goes <em>directly</em> to r/undelete.</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it, is FluentinTypo privy to some kind of magic reddit with different links and different channels? Because the last time I fucking checked, there was only <strong>one</strong> reddit, only <strong>one</strong> link (which I posted), and that link only goes <strong>one</strong> place. </p>

<p>So please explain to me how the hell this comment got 18 upvotes when the user is absolutely and utterly full of shit?</p>

<p>I would even go so far as to say that this user intentionally made this comment to try to distract from the content of this post.</p>

<p>All posts move up and down in rank all day long. None stay &quot;top&quot; longer than 8ish hours unless its a small subreddit where there is no new content to replace it. Reddit would suck if the algorithm didnt swap out stories. We would be looking at the same shit all day long. How else would a new post get to the top if not for replacing an older one? Jesus, this is standard top 40 radio theory, ala Kasey Kasem. How does this simple concept boggle you so much?

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Honestly, how is this user&#39;s comment upvoted so high? Look what he wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, <strong>I followed the links to the original submittion</strong> and it was not deleted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, so did I. The link is in the body of my post. <strong>A link that goes <em>directly</em> to r/undelete.</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it, is FluentinTypo privy to some kind of magic reddit with different links and different channels? Because the last time I fucking checked, there was only <strong>one</strong> reddit, only <strong>one</strong> link (which I posted), and that link only goes <strong>one</strong> place. </p>

<p>So please explain to me how the hell this comment got 18 upvotes when the user is absolutely and utterly full of shit?</p>

<p>I would even go so far as to say that this user intentionally made this comment to try to distract from the content of this post.</p>

<p>Ask yourself that question, not me. What is more simple, that a link to a shitty website gets deleted for breaking the rules of a sub? Or that everything that happens on reddit is because of secret government propagandists disguised as reddit employees? Again, you tell me. If you really believe number two is the more likely one, you need help, bra.</p>
