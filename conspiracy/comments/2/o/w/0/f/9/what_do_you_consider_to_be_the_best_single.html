    <div class="md"><p>I never second guessed anything until the CT gov made it illegal to request FOIA&#39;s (THEY broke the law and that&#39;s when my ears went up) and then the United Way (a public non-profit that is LEGALLY REQUIRED to be transparent) refused to disclose where the donation money was coming from and how it was being dispersed. These are two undeniable crimes committed by people that we are supposed to be trusting to help prevent this from happening again... yet they refuse to follow the law for FOIA and 501c3. Why?</p>

<p>Why is it that Columbine and VA Tech can be completely transparent and open without offending victims, but, in this one case, if you ask any questions you&#39;re harming someone? It was Halbig&#39;s <strong>job</strong> to investigate that shooting so when he was stonewalled, the red flags started flying for me. Because if the CT gov and police were serious about this shooting, they&#39;d be doing everything they could and working with everyone they could to make sure it didn&#39;t happen again. Unfortunately, that&#39;s not what they&#39;re doing. What could be the explanation for that?</p>

<p>Add on top of that that all these victims have been on the &quot;Sandy Hook Promise&quot; world tour as <strong>lobbyists</strong> and now I&#39;m about to throw up. What other tragedy has been followed up with the parents of the victims becoming political activists on a MAJOR scale. The &quot;victims&quot; aren&#39;t just doing bake sales in their neighborhood, they are on CBS and MSNBC and FOX doing interviews like they&#39;re promoting a movie or something, and the vast majority of them giggle through the whole thing. It&#39;s all very very strange...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A 130lb kid who&#39;s autistic and &quot;fearful of loud noises&quot; since youth suddenly goes into a school carrying 90lbs of guns, tac gear, and ammo (if not more) and hits EVERY TARGET 3-5 times achieving a kill-to-injured ratio higher than 1:1 (which is the DREAM of any professional shooter) and did it in record time. DON&#39;T make the mistake of thinking kids are &quot;easy to kill&quot; because NOTHING could be further from the truth. They fall in front of other kids, hide, and generally are very, VERY difficult to kill...considering their VERY low center of mass and their tiny heads (sorry if this sounds gross...it is, but its the truth).</p>

<p>This was an &quot;op&quot; plain and simple--they didn&#39;t even get the SCHOOL right in most of the shots (showing instead St Rose of Lima School). I mean, come the fuck on people.</p>

<p>Why did nobody care about &quot;the privacy of the students&quot; when Columbine happened?? What, 15 years later this school has LESS video surveillance gear than Columbine? Does ANY of this make sense--from the nonsensical ramblings of the coroner with Aspies to the empty threats of seemingly retarded Police Chief Vance to the houses in the neighborhood ALL BOUGHT AND PAID OFF IN FULL ON THE SAME DAY??? Not to me it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Why couldn&#39;t (or wouldn&#39;t) anyone in the county, including uber-rude Mr. Vance, tell me who Newtown had do the hazmat work at SHES and why I wasn&#39;t allowed to bid on said work? Why couldn&#39;t anyone see ANY shots of inside the school?? Is a PHOTO of a bullet hole with correct EXIF information too much to ask? For these monkeys, it apparently is. Why was the inside of the school that &quot;they&quot; DID allow us to see old-looking, dusty, and unused? Why did it NOT conform to ADA specifications? THAT ALONE proves this story is as fake as a three-dollar bill because...well...just TRY to open a building ANYWHERE in the US that&#39;s public and NOT ADA-compliant and see how fast it&#39;s shut down. My guess on a school? They&#39;d never, EVER let it open. Period.</p>

<p>EVERYTHING about this op stinks--and those who tell you that this WASN&#39;T an op are either misinformed, stupid, or lying to your face.</p>

<p>This is the problem with Sandy Hook. So many allegations have been made, but on a detailed examination, few of them stand up to close scrutiny, if viewed from a neutral perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those pictures shown show the bathrooms were NOT ADA compliant. Look at the stall size!</p>

<p>So lemme get this straight--I cannot, anywhere, open a public building in the USA without ADA approval...but SHES gets a pass?? How and WHY?</p>

<p>Explain this to me...and why it is obfuscated as to who did the HAZMAT cleanup and you&#39;re halfway to convincing me. But you are taking some very simple questions and lying about them.</p>

<p>I was wrong so thank you!</p>

<p>Killed to injured ratio was=26 to 1 at SHES!!! NO other gun disaster has even come CLOSE except the Port Arthur Massacre where a retarded, low-IQ boy actually got a KTIR HIGHER than that! They say he shot (and killed) everyone he aimed at, with a machine gun, without stopping, hitting EVERYONE he aimed at (FROM THE HIP btw--and he had NEVER handled a weapon before), in under 30 seconds. Over 20 people. &quot;Lanza&quot; is the new Martin Bryant!</p>

<p>Read:</p>

<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/sandy-hook-tragedy-corporate-medias-lone-gunman-storyline-losing-ground/5322426%3E">http://www.globalresearch.ca/sandy-hook-tragedy-corporate-medias-lone-gunman-storyline-losing-ground/5322426&gt;</a></p>

<p>For proof and more information.</p>

<p>So...tell me again how a 130lb kid afraid of loud noises managed to get ALL of that gear into the (non-ADA-Compliant) school, off a bunch of kids, doing this simultaneously with getting the HIGHEST KILLED-TO INJURED RATIO of any spree-killer in modern history?? Like...REAAALY high? Better than 95.1% of all SEAL gunmen who pass BUD/S!</p>

<p>Because your lies don&#39;t hold up to scrutiny. Well, I mean <em>their</em> lies. You are just one of the duped.</p>

<p>PS--Sorry about my &quot;bad&quot; KTIR earlier. I thought it was (and meant to type) 16:1.</p>

<p>We have another Port Arthur here--where an obviously retarded patsy who never &quot;formally&quot; existed goes with NO firearms training who, for no reason, walks into a school and obtains a higher KTIR than the best shooters in the world. First try. With <em>no</em> Israeli commandos &quot;helping out&quot; eh? Not bloody likely.</p>

<p>Still stinks--even WORSE than it did! Thanks for strengthening my argument for me! Got all of your citations? Great! Now learn to think for yourself and your journey to the &quot;real&quot; SHES may be nearing its end...</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know much about how the ADA works, do you? You do not have to have EVERY stall sized for the disabled. Tiitle II of the ADA <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/t2qa.txt">requires</a> &quot;that a public entity make its programs accessible to people with disabilities, not necessarily each facility or part of a facility. &quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just destroy one more paragraph of your uninformed rant, sadly typical of Hoaxers. </p>

<p>Wrong on every conceivable level</p>

<p>1) There were <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/17/15969867-police-second-person-injured-in-connecticut-school-shooting-survived?lite">two wounded</a> at Sandy Hook </p>

<p>2) So neither is it the highest kill ratio ever. Look up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erfurt_massacre">Erfut massacre</a>, for example. </p>

<p>3) There were 23 wounded at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur_massacre_%28Australia%29">Port Arthur Massacre</a>.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve hardly written a sentence that stands up even to cursory examination. Are you really this ignorant?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, yes he is. A mentally-ill young man, who had easy access to large amounts of weapons. That&#39;s Sandy Hook, entirely explained, without the need for delusional fairy-tales and factual inaccuracies. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s what you believe, why not go for it? However, the fact that none of the Hoaxists have done so - even though plenty have visited the town - seems quite telling. That would certainly blow the case wide open, so their deliberate choice NOT to do so seems to indicate they don&#39;t have faith in their own story.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s thousands of pages of documentation, buttressing and supporting the claim. Saying there&#39;s &quot;no such proof&quot; is factually incorrect: it&#39;s proof you personally don&#39;t accept, which is entirely different. What has been released has to comply with CT privacy law, which is among the strictest in the country. Now, you can say it&#39;s a bad law, and I wouldn&#39;t necessarily argue. But it&#39;s the law nonetheless, and you can&#39;t expect state and federal authorities to break it, just to please you. </p>

<p>But even if there was absolutely zero evidence, which is more plausible - that this is something we&#39;ve seen, sadly, hundreds of times before, or a completely unique scenario, with equally little evidence in favor of it? When you hear hooves, you should think horses, not zebras. </p>

<p>That is not quite accurate.  In a situation like this, the powers that be make a claim (this is how it went down).  They then produce evidence (videos, death certificates, what have you).  You are questioning the validity of that evidence.  In that sense, you are making the claim (this is all a hoax).

<p>usually the evidence backs up the claim, in this case the &#39;evidence of how it went down&#39; - or more accurately, the lack of and cover up of such evidence only raises more questions. </p>

<p>Just to be clear, I&#39;m not making any claim here.  The government is making one.  I am on neither side right now.</p>

<p>Leonard P. Osner would be a good start, but I might suggest one piece of evidence that would definitively show something has been covered up - the graves.  If there are no bodies in the graves, that very clearly shows that there is a coverup of some kind.  It is really the strongest and easiest to acquire evidence, one that would break the hoax open and get people on board for further investigation.</p>

Weep uncontrollably? Go catatonic? Laugh hysterically, unable to process it? I just just don&#39;t know for sure.  I&#39;m therefore very reluctant to judge anyone else by how they act.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also what feels like a kinda large gap between &quot;This person isn&#39;t acting the way I think they should behave&quot; and &quot;The entire incident was fake and nobody died.&quot; That&#39;s the sort of leap I have problems with. </p>

<p>I get it. I honestly couldn&#39;t tell you what I would do either. But I can tell you as someone who has spent quite a bit of time around aspiring actors/actresses that he was getting into character - exactly as I&#39;ve seen others do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I&#39;ve been participating in this thread all day. :)</p>

<p>Counterpoint #1: why wait until you&#39;re on stage and after the cameras or rolling <em>before</em> getting into character? I imagine your aspiring actors don&#39;t do that. Counterpoint #2: behaving &quot;like an actor would&quot; doesn&#39;t prove you ARE an actor. </p>

<p>Alternative hypothesis: Parker had been momentarily distracted - say, someone perhaps reminded him about a pleasant memory of his dead child. When that passed, and he had to address the media, he took a few deep breaths to compose himself [which seems particularly natural - I&#39;ve had to do that kind of thing, and am certainly not an aspiring actor!], before the severity of the situation then overwhelmed him again. </p>

<p>To me, this feels like one of the cases I mentioned before, where things seem suspicious only when viewed from a predetermined position. </p>

<p>I believe that people from various govt agencies very closely watch what is put on reddit and other large websites. From the various threads about the SH documentary being taken off all websites, I think it is somewhat sound to believe the government is covertly trying to suppress information. If this information was totally wrong like the rest, it would slip through, furthering the school of thought that conspiracy theorists are just crazy.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t want pictures of my dead child available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strangely none of the parents wanted to even see their dead kids except,  Veronique Haller?</p>

<p>Parents of the dead children were advised to identify them from photographs, such was the carnage. But every parent reacts differently. Veronique Pozner did the most difficult thing. She asked to see the body. Zeveloff asked her why.</p>

<p>“I owed it to him as his mother, the good, the bad and the ugly,” she said. “. . . And as a little boy, you have to go in the ground. If I am going to shut my eyes to that I am not his mother. I had to bear it. I had to do it.” </p>

<p>They don&#39;t have to be &#39;available&#39; to everyone, just some we elect to represent or hire to serve us that we can trust.   They do that with the 18000 abu ghraib picutres and videos we didn&#39;t see and other crimes - it works. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I&#39;m not familiar with this aspect. Do you have a link by chance?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s  not a matter of speculation, either the graves have the kids or they don&#39;t.  you will only find out by digging, but certainly they are either there or not - and not both. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would venture to say that the event being a hoax is the extraordinary claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but there could be no hoax claim  if it wasn&#39;t for the original claim of the shooting.. or are you now claiming there was no such mass shooting by a mental kid?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m looking for answers and as of yet I haven&#39;t received any.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why don&#39;t you look who Leo P. Osner is, and ask him why he is trying to remove videos about Lenny Pozner claiming copyright.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So no evidence then..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked you first, but you just have stories.   Evidence is in the graves, and enhanced interrogation of actors like Gene and Lenny.  They won&#39;t last one waterboarding.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I&#39;m not making any claim here.  The government is making one.  I am on neither side right now.</p>

<p>Leonard P. Osner would be a good start, but I might suggest one piece of evidence that would definitively show something has been covered up - the graves.  If there are no bodies in the graves, that very clearly shows that there is a coverup of some kind.  It is really the strongest and easiest to acquire evidence, one that would break the hoax open and get people on board for further investigation.</p>
