       I never second guessed anything until the CT gov made it illegal to request FOIA's (THEY broke the law and that's when my ears went up) and then the United Way (a public non-profit that is LEGALLY REQUIRED to be transparent) refused to disclose where the donation money was coming from and how it was being dispersed. These are two undeniable crimes committed by people that we are supposed to be trusting to help prevent this from happening again... yet they refuse to follow the law for FOIA and 501c3. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that Columbine and VA Tech can be completely transparent and open without offending victims, but, in this one case, if you ask any questions you're harming someone? It was Halbig's
       <strong>
        job
       </strong>
       to investigate that shooting so when he was stonewalled, the red flags started flying for me. Because if the CT gov and police were serious about this shooting, they'd be doing everything they could and working with everyone they could to make sure it didn't happen again. Unfortunately, that's not what they're doing. What could be the explanation for that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Add on top of that that all these victims have been on the "Sandy Hook Promise" world tour as
       <strong>
        lobbyists
       </strong>
       and now I'm about to throw up. What other tragedy has been followed up with the parents of the victims becoming political activists on a MAJOR scale. The "victims" aren't just doing bake sales in their neighborhood, they are on CBS and MSNBC and FOX doing interviews like they're promoting a movie or something, and the vast majority of them giggle through the whole thing. It's all very very strange...

       Ok. So you can you provide the United Way documents that he has been requesting? Your "debunking" just says that info is available online and he was turned down because they are supposed to have a reasonable amount of time to provide the requests.

       I was just googling and even went to the United Way home page, can't find that info anywhere. Do you know where I could find that supposedly public info?

       By the report, that appears to have been in response to one of those FOIA requests that you said were now "illegal". :) Filing your own one would seem the best way to go, if you want a copy.

       A 130lb kid who's autistic and "fearful of loud noises" since youth suddenly goes into a school carrying 90lbs of guns, tac gear, and ammo (if not more) and hits EVERY TARGET 3-5 times achieving a kill-to-injured ratio higher than 1:1 (which is the DREAM of any professional shooter) and did it in record time. DON'T make the mistake of thinking kids are "easy to kill" because NOTHING could be further from the truth. They fall in front of other kids, hide, and generally are very, VERY difficult to kill...considering their VERY low center of mass and their tiny heads (sorry if this sounds gross...it is, but its the truth).
      </p>
      <p>
       This was an "op" plain and simple--they didn't even get the SCHOOL right in most of the shots (showing instead St Rose of Lima School). I mean, come the fuck on people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did nobody care about "the privacy of the students" when Columbine happened?? What, 15 years later this school has LESS video surveillance gear than Columbine? Does ANY of this make sense--from the nonsensical ramblings of the coroner with Aspies to the empty threats of seemingly retarded Police Chief Vance to the houses in the neighborhood ALL BOUGHT AND PAID OFF IN FULL ON THE SAME DAY??? Not to me it doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why couldn't (or wouldn't) anyone in the county, including uber-rude Mr. Vance, tell me who Newtown had do the hazmat work at SHES and why I wasn't allowed to bid on said work? Why couldn't anyone see ANY shots of inside the school?? Is a PHOTO of a bullet hole with correct EXIF information too much to ask? For these monkeys, it apparently is. Why was the inside of the school that "they" DID allow us to see old-looking, dusty, and unused? Why did it NOT conform to ADA specifications? THAT ALONE proves this story is as fake as a three-dollar bill because...well...just TRY to open a building ANYWHERE in the US that's public and NOT ADA-compliant and see how fast it's shut down. My guess on a school? They'd never, EVER let it open. Period.
      </p>
      <p>
       EVERYTHING about this op stinks--and those who tell you that this WASN'T an op are either misinformed, stupid, or lying to your face.

       This is the problem with Sandy Hook. So many allegations have been made, but on a detailed examination, few of them stand up to close scrutiny, if viewed from a neutral perspective.

       They show no evidence of a shooting and, worse, they show the "operational" SHES was mothballed since the mid-to-late 90s.

       Why?

       AGAIN, NO SCHOOL MAY BE BUILT IN THE US UNLESS IT IS FULLY COMPLIANT FOR PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY DISORDERS. SHES had NONE of this...not even proper handicapped parking spaces.

       Those pictures shown show the bathrooms were NOT ADA compliant. Look at the stall size!
      </p>
      <p>
       So lemme get this straight--I cannot, anywhere, open a public building in the USA without ADA approval...but SHES gets a pass?? How and WHY?
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain this to me...and why it is obfuscated as to who did the HAZMAT cleanup and you're halfway to convincing me. But you are taking some very simple questions and lying about them.

       I was wrong so thank you!

      <p>
       Killed to injured ratio was=26 to 1 at SHES!!! NO other gun disaster has even come CLOSE except the Port Arthur Massacre where a retarded, low-IQ boy actually got a KTIR HIGHER than that! They say he shot (and killed) everyone he aimed at, with a machine gun, without stopping, hitting EVERYONE he aimed at (FROM THE HIP btw--and he had NEVER handled a weapon before), in under 30 seconds. Over 20 people. "Lanza" is the new Martin Bryant!

       So...tell me again how a 130lb kid afraid of loud noises managed to get ALL of that gear into the (non-ADA-Compliant) school, off a bunch of kids, doing this simultaneously with getting the HIGHEST KILLED-TO INJURED RATIO of any spree-killer in modern history?? Like...REAAALY high? Better than 95.1% of all SEAL gunmen who pass BUD/S!

       Because your lies don't hold up to scrutiny. Well, I mean

       lies. You are just one of the duped.

      <p>
       PS--Sorry about my "bad" KTIR earlier. I thought it was (and meant to type) 16:1.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have another Port Arthur here--where an obviously retarded patsy who never "formally" existed goes with NO firearms training who, for no reason, walks into a school and obtains a higher KTIR than the best shooters in the world. First try. With
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       Israeli commandos "helping out" eh? Not bloody likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still stinks--even WORSE than it did! Thanks for strengthening my argument for me! Got all of your citations? Great! Now learn to think for yourself and your journey to the "real" SHES may be nearing its end...

       the best evidence is of a cover up.    do you think that they were open and forthcoming enough with evidence that should have been easily available or not?

       the best evidence is in the empty graves of those kids, and the testimony of the actors interrogated.

       Do you claim there is not enough evidence of a coverup to warrant an investigation.   Remember the perps control the crime scene and the evidence.

       The best indications for me are not what is there, but what is not there.  No 600 kids, no bodies, no blood, no gunman, kids left in the building and taken out in the dead of night?   there's no evidence to suport the Sandy Hook mass shooting claim, but   hearsay and very deceptive 'witnesses'

       If that's what you believe, why not go for it? However, the fact that none of the Hoaxists have done so - even though plenty have visited the town - seems quite telling. That would certainly blow the case wide open, so their deliberate choice NOT to do so seems to indicate they don't have faith in their own story.

      <p>
       There's thousands of pages of documentation, buttressing and supporting the claim. Saying there's "no such proof" is factually incorrect: it's proof you personally don't accept, which is entirely different. What has been released has to comply with CT privacy law, which is among the strictest in the country. Now, you can say it's a bad law, and I wouldn't necessarily argue. But it's the law nonetheless, and you can't expect state and federal authorities to break it, just to please you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if there was absolutely zero evidence, which is more plausible - that this is something we've seen, sadly, hundreds of times before, or a completely unique scenario, with equally little evidence in favor of it? When you hear hooves, you should think horses, not zebras.

       Parents of the dead children were advised to identify them from photographs, such was the carnage. But every parent reacts differently. Veronique Pozner did the most difficult thing. She asked to see the body. Zeveloff asked her why.

       That is not quite accurate.  In a situation like this, the powers that be make a claim (this is how it went down).  They then produce evidence (videos, death certificates, what have you).  You are questioning the validity of that evidence.  In that sense, you are making the claim (this is all a hoax).  At this point, you are required to produce evidence to support your claim, to counter the evidence the powers that be have already provided.

       usually the evidence backs up the claim, in this case the 'evidence of how it went down' - or more accurately, the lack of and cover up of such evidence only raises more questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you put forward evidence of how it went down, then I can refute it.  But there is not evidence of how it went down.  There should be easily available such evidence but it's covered up and gagged.

       Leonard P. Osner would be a good start, but I might suggest one piece of evidence that would definitively show something has been covered up - the graves.  If there are no bodies in the graves, that very clearly shows that there is a coverup of some kind.  It is really the strongest and easiest to acquire evidence, one that would break the hoax open and get people on board for further investigation.

       Oh, I agree there.  But they won't.  That's already been made very clear.  No way in hell would they ever let anyone into their graves, for any number of reasons.  And that's the snag here, there are a lot of legitimate reasons to deny access to the grave, one of them quite prominently being that it's illegal to dig up
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       grave.  Things are very murky on this aspect of the case, and there's no legal way to get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me also be perfectly clear - I am not suggesting you do it.  The shitstorm that would fall on you would be epic in scope.  I'm simply saying that the existence (or lack thereof) of bodies in graves is the sort of evidence that would get all but the hardest of hardcore skeptics on your side.

       The easiest way would have been to disclose evidence of dead bodies to satisfy the skeptics.

       if some 'truthers' went and filmed themselves doing ground penetrating radar, the claim would be that they faked it, or were somewhere else.

       I honestly couldn't tell you with any certainty how I'd behave if I dropped off my kid at school one day, and they were gunned down by a psycho. Would I rage? Weep uncontrollably? Go catatonic? Laugh hysterically, unable to process it? I just just don't know for sure.  I'm therefore very reluctant to judge anyone else by how they act.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also what feels like a kinda large gap between "This person isn't acting the way I think they should behave" and "The entire incident was fake and nobody died." That's the sort of leap I have problems with.

       I get it. I honestly couldn't tell you what I would do either. But I can tell you as someone who has spent quite a bit of time around aspiring actors/actresses that he was getting into character - exactly as I've seen others do.

       Hey, I've been participating in this thread all day. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Counterpoint #1: why wait until you're on stage and after the cameras or rolling
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       getting into character? I imagine your aspiring actors don't do that. Counterpoint #2: behaving "like an actor would" doesn't prove you ARE an actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternative hypothesis: Parker had been momentarily distracted - say, someone perhaps reminded him about a pleasant memory of his dead child. When that passed, and he had to address the media, he took a few deep breaths to compose himself [which seems particularly natural - I've had to do that kind of thing, and am certainly not an aspiring actor!], before the severity of the situation then overwhelmed him again.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, this feels like one of the cases I mentioned before, where things seem suspicious only when viewed from a predetermined position.

       100 percent agree, this is the problem. Who is anybody to judge on what emotions are credible and what aren't if they haven't been put into the same, or at least a very similar situation.

       I don't have a strong conviction on whether or not SH happened. It really just doesn't matter. Nothing would really come from it being revealed, in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that people from various govt agencies very closely watch what is put on reddit and other large websites. From the various threads about the SH documentary being taken off all websites, I think it is somewhat sound to believe the government is covertly trying to suppress information. If this information was totally wrong like the rest, it would slip through, furthering the school of thought that conspiracy theorists are just crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr: I don't know about SH but I know it's fishy when information is suppressed.

       I'm with you here. What I saw in the doc were almost all things that appear either to be very subjective i.e. "these people are acting weird" or have plausible explanations that don't require a hoax e.g. the police dashcam was pointed in the wrong direction to capture the evacuation. That, and some very slipshod "investigative" techniques, seemed rather unconvincing to me.

       The dashcam thing really showed the bias of the author of the video.

       Strangely none of the parents wanted to even see their dead kids except,  Veronique Haller?
      </p>
      <p>
       Parents of the dead children were advised to identify them from photographs, such was the carnage. But every parent reacts differently. Veronique Pozner did the most difficult thing. She asked to see the body. Zeveloff asked her why.

       “I owed it to him as his mother, the good, the bad and the ugly,” she said. “. . . And as a little boy, you have to go in the ground. If I am going to shut my eyes to that I am not his mother. I had to bear it. I had to do it.”

       They don't have to be 'available' to everyone, just some we elect to represent or hire to serve us that we can trust.   They do that with the 18000 abu ghraib picutres and videos we didn't see and other crimes - it works.

       It's  not a matter of speculation, either the graves have the kids or they don't.  you will only find out by digging, but certainly they are either there or not - and not both.

       but there could be no hoax claim  if it wasn't for the original claim of the shooting.. or are you now claiming there was no such mass shooting by a mental kid?

       Why don't you look who Leo P. Osner is, and ask him why he is trying to remove videos about Lenny Pozner claiming copyright.

       I asked you first, but you just have stories.   Evidence is in the graves, and enhanced interrogation of actors like Gene and Lenny.  They won't last one waterboarding.

       Just to be clear, I'm not making any claim here.  The government is making one.  I am on neither side right now.

       Leonard P. Osner would be a good start, but I might suggest one piece of evidence that would definitively show something has been covered up - the graves.  If there are no bodies in the graves, that very clearly shows that there is a coverup of some kind.  It is really the strongest and easiest to acquire evidence, one that would break the hoax open and get people on board for further investigation.

       I understand your point.  And I know as well that it would be breaking the law to do so.  But, from a skeptic's point of view, it's really the best evidence to bring up.

       Besides, if they weren't there, you wouldn't be releasing photos of the victims now, would you? ;)
