       <strong>
        This seems to WHOOSHING over a lot of people's heads. Let me explain it:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What you are looking at is the footage of how they created the video of Earth at a distance. What you are watching is just an outtake. Buzz Aldrin claimed to the American public during the voice over that they were seeing the Earth from a distance with the camera lens shoved up against the shuttle window.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        They were actually in low Earth orbit and using the circular window and camera tricks to give the illusion of the Earth being far away.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        /edit
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ....................
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the segment of the video that really got me:
      </p>
      <p>
       The following gif shows when the Astronauts were recording their fake mock-up of the Earth by turning out all lights aboard the shuttle (which was in low-Earth orbit, nowhere near the moon) and placing a cut-out in the window to give the ingenious illusion of the Earth at a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just outtakes, when shown to the public, Buzz Aldrin says that they are seeing the Earth from a distance because "the camera is put up to the window of the shuttle".
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently, the stop button popped back up and we have this footage. Clearly showing that they were using a diffused work-light (top left) to see the buttons on the video camera (but not throw light onto the spacecrafts walls) while they created the illusion.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       ....................
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here they are playing with their window insert and preparing for the next shot, which will be a scene filmed inside the shuttle.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       ........................
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the real smoking gun. The transition from the "Earth at a distance" shot into setting up their next "in shuttle" shot.

      </p>
      <p>
       ..........................
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, if we really went to the moon. Then why would they be doing all of this trickery to produce a fake "Earth at a distance" shot?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are interested in seeing the whole segment,

        here is the youtube link
       </a>
       . The segment in question roughly begins around the 30 minute mark.

       <strong>
        edit: 67 comments and a lot of naysayers, but next to nobody actually providing an explanation for the gifs.

       You don't need to give evidence that I (and everyone else) already know about, to counterbalance what I am presenting. I am asking about what is shown in the gifs.

       And why bother building a 20' plaster of paris moon model, with a camera track going around it, along with the massive crane they built with a photo-realistic moon crater background?

       Probably to rehearse landing? They didn't have computer simulators like today, to get a moving picture in a simulator window, you moved a camera along a model. Remember, they drilled and drilled and drilled, and when they got sick of drilling, they drilled some more.

       Exactly, this is the reason. For simulator landings you really need to have it as realistic as possible. You don't get a second chance when doing the real landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       To OP: The gifs at the original post are in all ways normal and don't show anything out of ordinary to me. The camera moves and all kinds of things keep getting in between the camera and the window, whats so weird about that? The transition between lights off to the lit cockpit, what should we be seeing there?

       We are not looking at the entire earth, as we are led to believe. The video shows we are looking at just a small piece of the earth...its only round because the window is round.

       But the whole window is not filled with a view of Earth, or atleast that's how I see it. The Earth is moving in the window while the camera moves a bit, so it doesn't look like we would be seeing only a portion but the whole Earth.
      </p>

       Do you have a link to a better image quality video of this that would show the situation better?

       Besides, at the end when the astronaut walks in front of the window, it simply wouldn't work the way you describe. They say the camera is pressed right up against the window, so they are lying plain and simple right from the get go.

       Who is saying the camera is pressed against the window in that scene? It is pressed against the window in the scene where you can see only the Earth (the whole Earth), but not in the one where they light the cockpit up.

       That's still meaningless as the view of Earth should be panning quickly as low earth orbits are fast. So this footage must be filmed from afar.

       It is fully documented that the astronauts were still in low Earth orbit when filming this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proof is even in the third gif. When they turn on the light and move the window cut-out you can clearly see out the window and you
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       see space, you see a small portion of the Earth that fully fills the window.

       That fully fills the window? I don't see that, I see a small Earth in the top right corner and a big "lens flare" (I'm not a native English speaker, don't know the word for that kind of reflection or glare or something).
      </p>
      <p>
       The view is not the clearest possible I can say that, but the brightest point is right where Earth was before flipping the light switch.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as I wrote in my other reply just a minute ago, the biggest giveaway is the fact that the view of Earth stays the same for the duration of these clips. If it was a portion of Earth only and in LEO, the speed they should be moving to stay in orbit is so huge that the view would constantly change. Read the other reply for an example of what I mean.

       I suppose you could be right, I don't know enough about LEO orbits to dispute it. I will look into it though. When I posted this, I was not just looking for people to agree, I also wanted to hear reasons why the footage could be wrong.

       I'm not an expert on the matter either, but looking at clips from ISS filmed towards the Earth the view moves quite a bit.

       That's live view from ISS filmed towards the Earth. I don't know how wide that lens is, but that info should be available and thus should be easy to compare with the gifs you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the orbit speed should be roughly the same they would have had in the gifs because in orbit you can't go any slower or faster but just the right speed, otherwise you will either fall back to Earth or escape to space.

       What you are looking at is the footage of how they created the video of Earth at a distance. What you are watching is just an outtake. Buzz Aldrin claimed to the American public during the voice over that they were seeing the Earth from a distance with the camera lens shoved up against the shuttle window.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were actually in low Earth orbit and using the circular window and camera tricks to give the illusion of the Earth being far away.

       That would indeed be interesting, but I still can't see it. Can you describe the camera tricks you suspect a little closer? If they were in LEO the Earth would cover most of your field of view and in the video they aren't even close to the window, so all that should be visible in that little window is a small portion of Earth. If it was filmed with a very wide angle lens being pressed to the window it would look smaller indeed, but the lens they are filming with isn't wide at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: watched the videos over a few more times and it really looks like the Earth is moving as the camera moves and still shows the same image of Earth in there. If it was the window blocking most of the view and just making it look like we are looking at the full image of Earth, it would look totally different, the image would show a different portion of Earth while the camera moves. Why doesn't this happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Earth is clearly smaller than the window is. Do you think they have a silhouette on the window and they move it around?

       If they were in LEO the view would change quickly if what is described in the video really was taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
       LEO orbit speeds are immense and you can't just stay put like it looks like in the video. It must be from a good distance.

       What stays put? The "Earth". Don't you understand? There is no Earth at a distance staying put, there is only a circular window, a cut-out, and all the lights turned out in the shuttle.

       Yes, the view of Earth stays the same during the duration of those clips. If it was filmed from LEO the view would be moving, you know when you look trough a binocular towards Earth from say an airplane, the view moves fast. LEO speeds are fast, look at satellites go in the night, the view would be constantly changing, but in your clips the cloud formations for example stay the same all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example, film at the asphalt from a moving vehicle with the camera looking at the same direction all the time. Does the view change or stay the same? I'd say it changes and pretty fast. The very same will happen from LEO no matter what (unless they are in geostationary orbit but that's super unlikely)
      </p>
      <p>
       It really doesn't help what silhouette you would have in the window, it will not prevent the background from moving if you are moving really fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see what I mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: what I meant with staying put is that the spacecraft would need to stay put relative to Earth (or move directly away from it) in order to replicate the view we see in the clips and in the video. You can't stay put like that in LEO, you must be constantly going forwards with a huge speed in order to not fall back to Earth. Orbits work like that.

       Hows that a dodge? They went for "as realistic as possible". Maybe to you that seems "Hyper realistic". I dunno. They got better at it? You want the feeling during the actual event mimic the feeling during the rehearsal/drill.

       Your question makes no sense. And later computerized simulators were more versatile. I don't see why you are not getting this. They didn't have computer graphics in the late 60s... if they did, the would have used it.

       That site was gold, but it's hard to find online anymore.  There used to be a bunch more done by the same guy - I'll try to find them if you want.

       Since the space race was a cold war objective, i find it very likely that any real footage they might have snapped did not meet propaganda standards (loud, clear and simple), so even if they did manage to haul our ass up there and back, they most likely inserted fakery still to better seal the deal in world public opinion. Ultimately i don't see this as a smoking gun they didn't go, but a smoking gun they at least partially faked their imagery.

       The actual shot of the actual earth out the window behind the astronaut does indicate that they were not on the moon that time. Too far away from the low earth orbit they were actually in to be on the moon less than 10 hours later. It's just not possible with the tech they had.

       I think the important point is that the two ideas can mutually co-exist as you have noted.   Why not both go AND fake the footage?  This possibility isn't kick around often enough.

       Like I said in the post title, if (for arguments sake) we
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       go AND we faked the footage, then that raises about 1000 more questions that deserve thought.

       Yes, that is a good point. Just extra propaganda and more refined "evidence" to back up their real evidence. I mean, that does make sense but it also seems like kind of a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       People on this website always love to throw around Occam's Razor, so I guess the question would be "did they just fake everything or did they actually do the impossible and put a man on the moon and we are just seeing a couple things they faked"?

       You´re making a mistake. The word may be over-used, but the principle not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are discussing whether or not it may be more difficult to represent that someone walked on the moon as opposed to in reality having sent someone there. The answer is simple. Outcomes excluded, it is certainly always easier to fake the appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it easier to fake a road trip from NY to LA on video or actually make the trip? Is it easier to fake a car jumping the Grand Canyon, or make the jump in reality. Is it easier to fake a great historic battle, or actually have the battle again?

       These examples have an underlying theme.

        The bumpy U.S.-U.S.S.R. relationship in the years between 1957 and 1991 often was characterized by periods of mistrust and overt hostility (e.g., the U-2 incident, Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam War, Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and President Ronald Reagan’s depiction of the Soviet Union as an “evil empire”). Periods of détente, in contrast, led to the Limited Test-Ban Treaty in 1963, the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty in 1972, and an emerging U.S.-Soviet rapprochement during 1985-1991.
        <em>
         Throughout this political roller-coaster period of history, both countries increased areas of coop-eration, including space, as a symbol of warmer relations while cutting cooperation off when ties worsened.

       These scientists likely didn't just hate or love the "opposition's" scientific community whenever papa government told them to; they were colleagues and associates, men who had more in common with each other than their respective countries of origin.  Read the whole article for a decent perspective on the scope and duration of Soviet/American cooperation during the so-called "Cold War".

       Also bear in mind that the scientific community has no basis to claim a material blame from the moon (think double blind study to determine the origin) because we'd need a verified sample to test against.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could claim with some confidence the material didn't come from earth, but even the dinosaurs know that going into outer space isn't the only way to acquire extra-terrestrial materials.

       The most recent thing about the moon landing is all the rocks that were collected are gone. Word is NASA was victim of a heist that targeted the moon rocks. Now ask yourself, who could pull that off? Talk about surveillance and security, NASA has it.

       Especially when you consider this:  The president that made a pledge that we landed on the moon was Kennedy - pretty obvious conspiracy shit there.  The sitting president when the moon missions actually did happen was Nixon - he literally had to leave office for conspiring.  The man in charge of the Apollo missions was Wehrner Von Braun - he was a Nazi brought to America under Operation Paperclip.

       Here are some more questions for ya:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  How did the Apollo 13 crew survive in 38 degree weather for 3 days in a damp environment?  Hypothermia is measured in minutes not days in those conditions.  Add in the fact that they could only have 6 oz. of water a day and they must have been severely dehydrated which will also make hypothermia worse.  Bullshit!
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  The astronauts of Apollo 11 claim they couldn't see stars on the surface of the moon.  Bullshit!  Ask any astrophysicist and they will say you would be able to see stars on the moons surface because there is no atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  Why is the Orion shuttle essentially doing tests that even the Apollo shuttle could accomplish 45 years ago.  For instance they are testing to see if it can withstand the 4000 degree reentry heat, when the Apollo capsule could withstand 5000 degrees.  Its Bullshit.  Its so obvious that Orion is testing things NOW which we weren't able to accomplish in 1969.  If Apollo had landed on the moon what we would be doing right now in our preparation to go to Mars would be building a base on the moon, not dicking around retesting the Apollo capsule.

       That is fucking ludicrous.  Everyone is literally walking around with computers in their pockets more powerful than the computers used on the Apollo missions, yet you believe that the rest of the technology they have to re-figure out?  That is just retarded.

       Seeing stars is more than just a function of the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing">
        astronomical seeing
       </a>
       due to atmospheric effects, there is also sky brightness and light pollution. While you'll also lose out on sky brightness, there is still the issue of light pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
       With light pollution, you're going to get two issues; the albedo from the lunar surface and
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetshine">
        planetshine
       </a>
       from the Earth. Both of those combined should be more than enough to push the limiting magnitude below -2.6 or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why my hopes of a spectacular display where dashed when I camped atop Freel Peak one night. Atmospheric seeing and sky brightness were excellent, but a full moon drove the limiting magnitude to around 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's also why you get images like

       Pretty sure you can't see the stars when the moon is out because of Earth's atmosphere getting brightened.  That's why the sky is not pitch black like it would be during no moon.  There is no atmosphere on the moon.

       It's not only because the atmosphere is getting brightened; that's only one component (sky glow) of what limits naked eye limiting magnitude. You are still able to have light pollution in a vacuum that would prevent you from seeing stars.

       Nah, I have plenty of criticisms to level against our government, but they're grounded in things that actually do happen. We're never going to end gerrymandering or achieve campaign finance reform if half of us are running around saying "new analysis of WTC steel shows the government faked the moon landing with thermate charges!" (That is indeed something of a straw man caricature, but it's fun). So in that sense I'm something of a reality

       You don't think taxpayer dollars being dumped into fraud is a real issue?  You don't think the world being lied to en masse is a real issue?  You don't think children being taught complete and utter bullshit in schools is a real issue?  You don't think people being actively encouraged to not think critically is a real issue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, I've heard varieties of your stupid argument before.  Usually from debunkers that say things like "why not talk about real issues instead of wasting your time with conspiracies."  Yours is the exact same argument.

      <p>
       The Apollo missions are
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       questionable.  Stop backing away from it just because you think it weakens your credibility for "real conspiracies."  Most people think your "real conspiracies" are bullshit too - you're nothing but a stupid conspiracy theorist to them so you might as well grow a backbone and look at
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       issue with the same critical eye.

       Exactly. And this is one of the go-to videos that people post to "debunk" skeptics. Which is saying something as well. Evidence is NOT the rant of some guy who is basically saying "We went there because we were told we went there and I don't believe we could have faked it because I know everything that was possible at the time."

       Honestly, I have seen this link posted
       <em>
        countless
       </em>
       times. And I have actually sat through the whole thing and tried to take it as seriously as I could.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, this video is just a guy mocking anyone who doesn't believe the story that government and NASA gave us. The fact that he uses a particular tone, one that implies "And if you don't believe me (some guy) then you are an iiiiidiot" does not make him a valid representative of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would equally not believe a video of some guy talking and using the tone "If you don't believe in aliens you are an iiiiiidiot" and then using his own speculations to "prove" his point.
      </p>
      <p>
       This video is literally just some guy talking. He acts like he is privy to the same information of top government officials and knows exactly what technology was around at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tldr
       </strong>
       : His personal speculations are one giant assumption based on the incorrect declaration that he (some guy who was probably in college at the time)
       <em>
        knows
       </em>
       what the most powerful superpower in the world was capable of doing or not doing.

       So what's more likely, we invented the amazing aerospace technology and went to the moon, or we invented movie technology decades ahead of its time, and hid it for no reason other than to fake a moon landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are looking for a conspiracy where none exists. You used an ad hominem attack instead of refuting his points. Who had the technology to pull off such a perfect fake?
      </p>
      <p>
       You would have us believe that during the '60s, NASA was just using the rockets and astronauts as a front to hide the fact that they were moving film and television technology decades ahead with the sole purpose of creating an elaborate ruse to win a space race that no one was actually running?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no axe to grind here. I mistakenly thought that you were an actual skeptic. It turns out you appear to be a zealot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, everyone is so hung up on Apollo 11 as being this huge conspiracy. You know we went 5 more times. The last three times, we took a car. We have rocks from the moon. They left reflectors on the moon to shoot lasers at, in order to measure distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, even when people got bored with the moon landings, and the last three were canceled, NASA was still grinding out fakes on Apollo 17, which no one was watching?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would like to refute my points, and the points brought up in the video, please enlighten us. If you just want to bag on me in an attempt to validate your own position without discussing the topics raised, then you have proven my point.

       Obviously, the aerospace technology was developed in its own time. We had space capsules as early as Gemini. The entire space race was won with slide rules. The USSR had space capsules too, we were not exclusive to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you cannot find any evidence to support that film and television technology, at that time, existed, anywhere in the world, such that a person or group could even create the hoax that you are trying to propose. One technology actually existed, one did not. You didn't fix anything for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be solved with a few simple questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If man never walked on the moon, where did we get the rocks?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the rocks didn't come from the moon, where did we get them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Final question. Cui bono? If it was NASA and the Feds who perpetrated this hoax, to what end? Apollo was canceled before it was finished. If what you propose is true, then we are looking at the most amazing failure of a hoax ever. If you want me to believe, based on 3 gifs, that NASA did all of this just to shoot themselves in the foot, you will have to do better than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a false equivalency, but the only thing more preposterous is the idea that you could destroy 3 buildings with 2 planes.

        <p>
         All publicly available moon rock specimens have been shown to be of terrestrial origin.

       You cited 2001: A Space Odyssey as your proof of concept that this hoax was possible. I'm not even going to say anything else. That can just stand by itself.

      <p>
       You can't even speculate as to an alternative source for moon rocks, since that would be a critical piece of any true refutation of the moon landing.

      <p>
       Finally, without motive, you have no case. If you cannot even hazard a guess as to why NASA and the government would spend an obscene amount of money to produce a hoax that no one was really interested in, I'm not sure what purpose is served by denying the multiple landings on the moon.

       Speculation is not necessary. Just as the Russians placed their own laser retro-reflectors on the moon during the Lunokhod missions, the Russians also brought back moon samples during as part of their Luna Program.

       As I have said elsewhere on this thread, proving a lie is often easier than proving motive for that lie, but there are several possible motives. The most compelling one for me is that in the midst of the ideological and global hearts and minds battle that was the Cold War, the USA was panicking about the multiple successes of the Soviet space program (until Apollo, NASA was behind the USSR on every metric). The US moon landings changed the perception of that.

       You are assuming the guy in that video is being 100% honest. No telecine needed, b/c the moon "footage" was actually proJected on a giant screen for TV stations to film and re-broadcast. So there is no "original" footage, just what network TV stations "recorded" off a giant projection of the "live feed"

       Looks to me like they were shooting the earth through a window. When they change the exposure settings to show inside the capsule, the earth outside in bright light becomes over exposed. There's nothing there that anyone who's done a lot of photography or film/video wouldn't expect...

       The window is a circle. Shooting a video with the camera so far back would give the illusion of the Earth being very far away, that is the entire point. That is what we are watching.

       I also agree with this line of thinking. That is why I said in my title that I still believe we went. The questions that these gifs raise for me is why we would make fake footage. Most likely because what we actually found up there was deemed "too much" for mass human consumption.

        Astronaut Neil Armstrong carefully took out his Masonic apron and held it up for the cameras over his space suit as if to cover his genitals area-the power center, or dynamo, of Luciferian energy in Masonic ritual. Today, a photograph of Armstrong holding his occultic apron hangs on a wall at the House of the Temple, the sanctuary of the Scottish Rite, in Washington, D.C.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next, brother Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, at the time a 32° Masonic initiate, planted on the moon's surface the real flag intended for honor, the flag the Apollo 11 had carried in its storage compartment, the flag with the Scottish Rite's emblem of deep and mysterious spirituality, the doubleheaded eagle.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Since non-members are not allowed into Masonic Temples it's impossible for Texe to know if there hangs a photo o Armstrong on the moon holding an "apron" with Masonic-symbols on. The photo in question is a well known fake.
Also, there is the little detail that the camera was broadcasting to the whole world, do you seriously think no one would have noticed and remembered to this day? You don't think a copy of the broadcast showing Armstrong holding the "masonic-apron" and Aldrin planting a masonic flag on top of the American would have be available on youtube by know?

       Yes, with a little searching you can find images of this photo at the Masonic Temple. So when you say it's "impossible for Texe to know" you're projecting your own false opinions as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you say the photo, that you won't admit exists, is a "well known fake", which makes even less sense.
      </p>

       And about the camera broadcasting... So it broadcast every single second, of every angle of the lunar mission, live, back to public on Earth? Get real.

       Whilst I believe that the lunar images are a hoax I have a really hard time trusting this footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why but something about it just doesn't seem right, I mean it was literally produced by NASA and they don't even have the original moon walk on file anywhere. They are so effective at scrubbing their own records that there is not any of the originals left from the first moon landing, how would this have survived?
      </p>
      <p>
       My other concern is why go to so much effort to fake it, you wouldn't really need to have them in low earth orbit and it could all be faked with models and sets in a studio. It seems like a huge risk to have these astronauts whose lives you are so diligently protecting by not sending them on an impossible and dangerous mission and risk it all with the potential mess of take-off and re-entry.

       Maybe they put energy into doing both of those things. If they didn't go to the moon, then where did all the money go? So they certainly could fund multiple angles for which to fake these things.

       Both valid points, I suppose it just boils down to being easier to fake entirely on earth than the sort of half real/half fake hoax that the Paper Moon footage implies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another possibility is that this is a straw man just waiting to be burned to discredit the lunar hoax theorists but of course it could very well be true. Something about it just wreaks of high level disinfo to me and I just can't shake it.

       Even good liars get caught a lot. It seems like to get away scott-free one needs to be an extremely good liar, be very intelligent, AND have a great deal of luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also depends on how big the crime was. If we actually faked all of the moon footage, that is a pretty big crime and would need a lot of time and energy to cover-up. Naturally, a couple things could slip through the net. Like this video footage.

       If a single piece of irrefutable evidence against the moon landing were to surface, don't you think the enemies of the US would snatch it up and publicise it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind at the time the US was in the space race with the Soviet Union - Yet the Soviets didn't question the validity of the moon landing.

       That makes me confident that even if Russia did release evidence proving it was a hoax, it would be quickly dismissed as "Russian propaganda".

      <p>
       Also, we are not privy to entire reality, for all we know, aliens exist and all of the major superpowers know it. This would be a valid reason to both fake the moon landings AND have a team effort to make it look valid.

       Our "enemies", huh?  I leave you with this appropriate quote, relevant to the times both then and now:
      </p>
      <p>
       "There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&amp;T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state, Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, minimax solutions, and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments, just like we do. We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale. The world is a college of corporations, inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale. It has been since man crawled out of the slime."

        The bumpy U.S.-U.S.S.R. relationship in the years between 1957 and 1991 often was characterized by periods of mistrust and overt hostility (e.g., the U-2 incident, Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam War, Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and President Ronald Reagan’s depiction of the Soviet Union as an “evil empire”). Periods of détente, in contrast, led to the Limited Test-Ban Treaty in 1963, the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty in 1972, and an emerging U.S.-Soviet rapprochement during 1985-1991. Throughout this political roller-coaster period of history, both countries increased areas of coop-eration, including space, as a symbol of warmer relations while cutting cooperation off when ties worsened.

       These scientists likely didn't just hate or love the "opposition's" scientific community whenever papa government told them to; they were colleagues and associates, men who had more in common with each other than their respective countries of origin. Read the whole article for a decent perspective on the scope and duration of Soviet/American cooperation during the so-called "Cold War".

       I agree but how do we know that they were in LEO? I agree if they were that it would be perfectly feasible but my point was that it would be less risky to have them safely on earth than to risk the launch and re-entry.

       Fair point, I should stress I don't necessarily disagree, it is more than possible that they sent them up and orbited them for a few days but unfortunately I do not see this footage as proof of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it is how can one claim that NASA has been producing fraudulent images and then use them as a source for an image? It results in a circular logic problem so as powerful as the footage is, personally I dismiss it.

       The apollo missions were a propaganda piece that will not stand the test of time. Unlike other conspiracy theories, where all witnesses can be silenced and no one will ever know what actually happened, the moon landings make falsifiable claims about space travel and the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we finally do find a way for humans to survive past low earth orbit, we'll have proven that the apollo missions were a hoax. Until then, I guess we can all just keep watching Cosmos reruns and ticking off how long it's been since we were driving around electric cars on the moon (42 years now).

       <em>
        I
       </em>
       would have known it was fake."

       Then why would the camera be so far back from the window? The point is that since the window is round, we would see a round ball with Earth features if the camera was set back and all the interior lights out.

       as a photographer, if you are filming the day side of earth its going to get washed out by the sun if you are too close to the window.   Personally, I get as far back from the window as possible to eliminate any glare or possible lens flare from the sun.  Essentially, he's using the capsule as a lens hood for the camera.

       So, I just watched the video (not a BBC documentary). The narrator is saying that (1) they blocked out the Sun so that they could shoot the moon from the other side of the spacecraft without the walls showing and (2) they used some sort of cutout to make the Earth look smaller and that's why it's not perfectly round. Also, (3) ""these conversations discussing their deceptions were believed to be private ... until now."
      </p>
      <p>
       My interpretation of the video: (1) they didn't want reflections of anything off the
       <em>
        window
       </em>
       and (2) the Earth didn't look perfectly round because they weren't directly on the day side of the Earth. Similarly, the moon only looks perfectly round when it's a full moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) The conversations between Houston and Apollo were over an open radio transmission that anybody with the right equipment could tune in to listen. They were not private. They were also documented in the official transcripts.

       Assume for a second that these shots are faked.  The video presents a

       It does not logically follow that there were no moon landings because you can't imagine a different reason to fake some pictures.

       I think this a fair point, but apart from a conspiracy to fake the moon landings, what purpose would these actions serve?
      </p>
      <p>
       Liars are attempting to control the agenda, and this will work
       <strong>
        until
       </strong>
       their lie is discovered and disproved, at which point others are entitled to pretty much disbelieve everything the liars say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have posted the following link many times here, and I find it presents compelling analysis based on NASA's own published material, that the Apollo mission walkabouts were filmed in a giant studio on this planet and not on our moon (ie it supports the Kubrick theory).

       <strong>
        THIS
       </strong>
       is the best evidence based on scientific principle that there was some level of
       <em>
        shenanigans
       </em>
       going on with photos associated with the moon landings.  Anyone who hasn't seen this info should take a serious look.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least, (my favorite pet theory) the photos were doctored to mask something in the distance that mere humans aren't allowed to see.  It would be have been quite possible with technology available back in the 60s to use real foreground imagery with faked backgrounds and optically print the two together (oldschool Photoshot layers).  At most, the whole thing was staged, but as far as proof, it only proves mopery was going on behind the scenes.

       I agree the parallax inconsistencies could be the result of post-production intervention rather than studio fakery. Perhaps the key is that we have evidence provided by NASA itself which unwittingly undermines NASA's own narrative.

       Not even close.  The stereoscopic analysis of all photographs proves rear projection tech was used.  The number of errors is impossible given the fact they may have been there.  None of the images are legit.

       Like I said in the title, these shots alone do not prove (to me) that we didn't go to the moon. For all I know, we went into space and found something crazy so we manufactured the pictures to not alarm the public.

       Honestly, if you want to blow your mind and others' then you should try the truth.   I think moon landing conspiracy theorist can't actually fathom what really happened and how complex it was.   so they go with easiest concept.  Since it's uncomfortable to think of a person who is smarter than them they think that the smarter person must be lying.

       Are you kidding? How is "we went to the moon because we are so smart" more complex than an elaborate hoax that would represent the biggest conspiracy in the history of the humankind?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the one going with the easy concept. Your concept boils down to "I saw it on TV, so I know it happened".

       The conspiracy theorist concept raises 1000's of very, very difficult questions.

       You didn't answer how it was possible for an unmanned craft to leave retroreflectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure it was rhetorical anyways, but you missed the point that retroreflectors can get to the moon without humans, so they don't prove humans went to the moon.

       Believing that the government is too incompetent to fool the public is a trick that governments have been playing for 1000's of years.

       Then by your doctrine our world has already been f*cked far into the future and it started a thousand years ago.  So why did they let you figure it out?  And let you share their secrets?  That doesn't make sense if they are so powerful.

       No, by my doctrine, the concept of government has been around for 1000's of years. And even Sun Tsu (Art of War) understood that the biggest advantage you could have over your enemy is for them to underestimate you.

       Can you please explain why? I would love to have someone debunk this. I honestly cannot think of any other explanation other than the people making the documentary hiring actors and actually faking this entire part. But that is pretty far-fetched.

       the earth is much larger in low earth orbit than depicted in your "evidence."  First gif one frame of what looks like lens flare from the reflection of the earth off the lens. Second gif doesn't prove diddly you have no idea what is blocking the view of the earth.  Third gif looks like a orbital sunrise to me.  so what are you trying to prove exactly?

       Of course I did, and it goes on to talk about the photographic evidence of it on the surface of the moon.  Did you even read your own source?   You can't accept photo evidence of A(the robots) , then dismiss photo evidence of B(Apollo landings) when both photos are taken in a similar fashion. Just because A is a robot does not mean B is.  This course of fallacies is not successful.

       It is funny how there are photographs of that robots tracks on the moon, yet you dismiss all the photo evidence of the Apollo landing sites.   You just destroyed your own argument.  We are done here.

       No, by my doctrine, the concept of government has been around for 1000's of years. And even Sun Tsu (Art of War) understood that the biggest advantage you could have over your enemy is for them to underestimate you.

       That is fucking ludicrous.  Everyone is literally walking around with computers in their pockets more powerful than the computers used on the Apollo missions, yet you believe that the rest of the technology they have to re-figure out?  That is just retarded.

       You don't think taxpayer dollars being dumped into fraud is a real issue?  You don't think the world being lied to en masse is a real issue?  You don't think children being taught complete and utter bullshit in schools is a real issue?  You don't think people being actively encouraged to not think critically is a real issue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, I've heard varieties of your stupid argument before.  Usually from debunkers that say things like "why not talk about real issues instead of wasting your time with conspiracies."  Yours is the exact same argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Apollo missions are
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       questionable.  Stop backing away from it just because you think it weakens your credibility for "real conspiracies."  Most people think your "real conspiracies" are bullshit too - you're nothing but a stupid conspiracy theorist to them so you might as well grow a backbone and look at
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       issue with the same critical eye.
