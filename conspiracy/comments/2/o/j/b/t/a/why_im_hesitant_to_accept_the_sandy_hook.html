      <p>
       I don't know what it is with Sandy Hook.  To be honest, the physical evidence is there for me to believe it all, but psychological constraints remain, and I find it hard to wrap my head around it all (which shouldn't be an issue considering how obsessive I am about 9/11).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, believing in 9/11 means I believe that there was A singular conspiracy to achieve certain objectives (war, oil, heroin fields, Iraq central bank &amp; petrodollar related stuff, religious aspects leading to animosity towards Muslims, Israeli benefits, $2.3 trillion missing, increase in military spending and establishment of homeland security, individual profits via insider trading and Silverstein's lease, asbestos solution, hiding the $240 trillion bonds come due on 9/12 [if those claims are substantive, which I'm yet to be sure of], etc.)  But additionally believing that Sandy Hook was just a drill by (someone fill me in here...CIA? Who?) means more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means that I would be buying into the idea that:
*A good portion of residents in Newtown would have to be silenced about Sandy Hook Elementary being closed since 2008, as alleged by some.
*The kids involved, especially those interviewed, were in on it.  Of course, it's not difficult to mislead a 5/6 year old, but they'll need to be silenced for life.
*Every news station breaking the original story was, in a way, in on it.  Everyone on the ground setting up camp, conducting interviews, gathering information, and even flying the helicopter(s), was close enough to know what was really going on.  Either they have been silenced, or were in on it.  I don't have to reach this conclusion with 9/11 because the inside job, for the most part, didn't directly extend to the media.  Initial media responders on the scene actually did their jobs which provided key clues to our fight, such as Barry Jennings' response (minus FOX w/ Harley Guy and 1 or 2 others that seemed clearly placed, but those shills could have been actively seeking camera crews, so it doesn't really implicate the news networks).  Plus, they couldn't get close enough to the scene in attempt to blow the lid on something since there were only 80 minutes between first impact and collapse, and the scene was closed off thereafter.  Broadcast teams in the studio and not on the ground that day were simply reading from a teleprompter.  Decisions on what goes into the teleprompter come from the above chain of command, so probably only a select few had to be in on it.  Of course there was the situation where BBC reported WTC7's collapse an hour before it commenced, but again, that's coming from the higher ups manufactured script.  The news work after 9/11 was set up to dismiss and patronize any conspiratorial thoughts, but news heads didn't have to be in on the conspiracy to do this, rather 9/11 jolted most Americans' patriotism thus causing most to strongly support the official story from the get-go.
       <br/>
       So the difference that I'm trying to hammer out is that top execs of the MSM were clearly in on 9/11, and therefore could be in on Sandy Hook, but every single member of the live camera crews that initially responded would have to be in on it too.  I've done some reading on Operation Mockingbird, and am aware of things like Anderson Cooper interning for the CIA, but there simply isn't enough information on media exploitation, at least in my opinion, to automatically accept this.
*9/11 wasn't a lone operations, rather it was just an act in the script that includes Sandy Hook.  It would mean that TPTB are out in full force to get our weapons, wouldn't it?  It would mean that there actually was a plan to enslave every being on this planet, as guys like JFK &amp; Aaron Russo have explained.  It would mean that there actually is a shadowy group, the Free Masons, Illuminati, or whoever, that runs the show, influences every societal change, and is moving the world along according to their script.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see what I'm getting at?  For Sandy Hook the physical evidence is there (though the crisis actors claims doesn't have much basis, and I haven't heard much of the "debunker" side of the story yet), but grasping this conspiracy's existence calls for quite a change in my worldview.  Believing that 9/11 is a Mossad/Saudi/Neocon operation is one thing, but believing that it's just one paragraph in a pre-written book is a whole other thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a college student who has already taken his fair share of flak for "insane" 9/11 views, this would just catapult me to another level.  So I plan on extensively researching the topic (to the extent I've researched 9/11) before I firmly conclude what I may be suspecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two final thoughts.  One, if possible, please share any and all Sandy Hook related information here!  Second, if you believe the Sandy Hook conspiracy and thus believe "their" goal was to take away our guns, how exactly do you see them trying to achieve this, and how soon? Be realistic in your answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       ADD: Something that I believe would greatly improve this subreddit is if you kept links of interest in an organized way.  There is some great information under "Non-reddit resources", but creating specialized folders on the side bar, such as "9/11", "Sandy Hook", "MK Ultra", "Zionist Elite", "James Holmes', etc. would be very beneficial and provide excellent, organized, information for skeptics visiting the subreddit.

       when you consider that sandy hook is probably a spook town, then add in some (or alot) of national security letters and it is entirely possible.

       I think you've gone too far. Just because the media is given misinformation doesn't mean the reporters experiencing the scene are "in on it." At the least, the police on the scene would need to be on it, though.

       Here is a tip: You know the video when the piggies busted open the shed and went in with a police dog?
      </p>
      <p>
       That was shot the day before, December 13th.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the morning of the 14th when the piggies were chasing three "shooters" into the woods, we can see the shed already busted open. But the cops just got there. WTF?

       Its an observance.

       You can see in many news videos the piggies busting open the shed door.

       Sandy Hook definitely happened, I know many people involved including children who almost died and lost real friends. Seeing people adamant about there being actors and shit makes me a little sick inside. Stick to 9/11 theories they're plausible

       Personally I don't know nor care if sandy hook was set up (I doubt it), regardless, it is being utilised by
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       ? The government? The Zionist Elite? lol... no.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       greatest allusions is making you think they are
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       body...
      </p>
      <p>
       After looking at history, the most frequent cause of government foul play is usually due to infiltration by a lobby or group. This means that it's not the government per se who are conspiring, but others who use governments as tools for their conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       , they are the same folk that have always been - Families of nobility, acquired via history, religion, chivalry, royalty, banking, business etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       We went from hunter-gather society to feudal society and we haven't changed since, democracy is not
       <em>
        real

       There is a romanticised term called the "Black Nobility", which more or less sums up
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       they are BUT most of the public information is tainted (usually with some anti-christ or reptilian bullshit) and specifics are hard to determine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionist elite image is a charade too, masking the reality with the face of an familiar 'enemy'. Sure many banks and corporations run by jews may be involved in controlling wealth... but only monetary wealth! They don't possess the same
       <em>
        dominion
       </em>
       that the "Black Nobility" do, they don't dictate vast amounts of land and natural resources like the Crown (UK) or the Vatican....

       Yeah I watched this about two days ago after it was posted here, it's what rekindled my interest in the topic.  I think that, for the most part, this documentary is more focused on smaller individual pieces of information and doesn't grasp the full conspiracy, but I liked that in a way.

       Wtf are you talking about "the physical evidence is there for me" thats the problem with sandy hook there literally is NO physical evidence to support the fact that 20 kids were shot dead in a school. There is actually TONS of evidence to the contrary though, and why would the government go through such great lengths to conceal evidence if there was nothing to hide?

       Here's whats confusing to me about this you guys.   REAL conspiracies are going on (police brutality cover up,  corporate propaganda focusing on privatization and deregulation, ect.) and you keep focusing on the saddest lamest theories that wouldn't even exist without the internet.  Is it more satisfying to concentrate on sketchy theories  other than concrete ones?

       Researching this doesn't divert my focus, stop acting like it's that black and white.  If there's reasonable information to explore, dismissing it as "saddest" and "lamest" is just ignorant.  Plus, the "real conspiracies" going on are a piece of the bigger picture.

       Hate to burst your bubble but r/conspiracy does not count as research.  I'm more curious about why people are attracted to denying real info.  As a news junky I'm blown away.
