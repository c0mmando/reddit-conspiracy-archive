<p>The thing we definitely shouldn&#39;t be doing is relying on the Alex Jones and Jeff Renses of the world, they act as a form of centralisation an potentially are therefore a weakness in terms of co-opting, blackmail and being a placed agent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, this sub has turned into a playground for people who post the same crazy blogs and links and then a swarm of other users come in and turn the comment section into &quot;see this is why conspiracy and the users here are idiots&#39;.</p>

<p>A self-post culture needs to be strong here, yet it seems like most self-posts are either immediately downvoted and never make the view, or they become hives of snarky comments and arguments that have nothing to do with the post.</p>

<p>A lot of times, the people making self-posts will get so discouraged by this that they never do it again. This has happened to me many times, and a couple times I left this sub for over 6 months before deciding to post again.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing is that in the 20 or so self-posts I have made, it is always something off-topic that becomes the source for ridicule. Like the metaphor I used, or the wording, or a single typo or grammatical mistake.</p>

<p>I have found, truly, that if anyone wanted to come into <em>any</em> thread and find an obscure reason to argue, they could. Because there is no way to make a post that is 100% perfect and there never will be. That is why this is a conspiracy site, because we are discussing topics that are going to have blank spaces here and there. </p>

<p>I have no problem with disagreements or counter-arguments, I welcome them. But what I cannot stand is when threads become petty arguments about things that are not even related to the topic. </p>

<p>This has become significantly more common within the last 6 months or so.  Not just self-posts but any &quot;good&quot; post these days seems to have way less chance of reaching the top 5.  Some don&#39;t ever reach the front page at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are some really good points, I frequent a few forums that are under direct targeting from JTRIG style trolls such as the BitcoinTalk forum and you see the same sort of hostile culture. My suspicion is that it is an effective tactic for quelling discussion, it discourages new members and prevents original discourse.</p>

<p>We have chunks of the &#39;troll&#39; play book but even then their tactics are highly effective particularly for sliding and suppression. We appear to be at an impasse where either the trolls will take over or the meek shall inherit the internet.</p>

<p>Personally I think one good way of promoting intelligent, rational discourse is microtipping to reward people who are polite and interesting. Let me know if you need help collecting it or want to know more about Bitcoin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. One of my past accounts drew some attention and I began getting harassed daily by a creepy group of users with no history. Of course, it could have been the &#39;tards just playing around and fucking with me for shits and giggles. But then again...</p>

<p>Either way, it was not cool.</p>

<p>And that was only the side effect. While I was actually posting and trying to have decent conversations, all of the trolls came out of the woodwork. And once they make a note of your username, vote-brigading just becomes a part of your life. And unfortunately, when all of your comments get immediately hit into the negatives, even real users began to get confused as to whether or not you are genuine. Its all very psychological.</p>

<p>I mean, look at my comment in this very thread currently at zero:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thats a great idea. If the folks at r/worldnews can make a filtering system, why can&#39;t we?</p>

<p>I would love to come here and immediately be able to filter out particular subjects that pop up every single day. Or, like you said, links to someone&#39;s blog.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too, that is one of the main reasons I started using new accounts. My main account was many years old and had crazy comment karma. And then I realized that those imaginary points were actually really making me hold back and not be as honest as I wanted to be.</p>

Normally the comment says something like &quot;this is why nobody takes this sub seriously&quot;, &quot;I have a tinfoil hat for you&quot;, or something like that that distracts from the damaging topic at hand.

    <div class="md"><p>Content control is a slippery slope, I see plenty of things that I would like to remove, but that would lead to inevitable cries of censorship. What we like to do is let the users decide what should make it to the top of the page. If you want to do a good write up/self-post encouraging more users to visit the new submissions page then I would definitely present it to the other mods for a sticky nomination. I think you make several valid points here. </p>

<p>If I had my way I would remove the majority of UFO/ancient alien submissions made to the sub, but I can&#39;t do that without alienating some of our userbase or being accused of being some sort of malicious government censorship agent, when in reality I just find UFO conspiracies to be childish and amateur. As a matter of fact I would even go as far as saying that some of those UFO video submissions are submitted here by the conspiratard crowd and brigaded to the top of the page to make us seem like a less serious sub, of course I have no way of proving that. </p>

<p>But I digress, write up a good self post encouraging users to visit the new page more often and I&#39;ll nominate it to be stickied atop the page for a few days and if its agreed upon your sticky will go up and you&#39;ll see the quality of the front page go up drastically. That way front page submissions are better and the mods won&#39;t hear cries of censorship either. </p>

<p>I think that self posts about visiting the new page should be stickied every 2-3 months just to remind <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users how important it is that the new submissions page not be manipulated in any way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a great idea, and thank you for taking a genuine interest in the state of the sub. Users like you keep this place interesting, don&#39;t let the shills get you down. </p>

<p>I know what its like to have yourself invested in your own self-post. You feel like those are your words, thoughts and iterations that are being ridiculed by a seemingly endless cadre of shills, trolls and conspiratards. Try to look at it this way, your iterations are provoking this response from these shills because they don&#39;t want the users here to be emboldened enough to submit their own original content to this sub. They don&#39;t want this place to be one that is friendly to original thoughts, they want you to be scared of criticism. </p>

<p>In short, they don&#39;t want anyone here to get enough confidence in themselves by way of positive feedback from the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community because then they might have another James Corbett on their hands to worry about. </p>

<p>The fact that people can&#39;t see the difference between this and removing obvious troll posts is part of the problem.</p>

<p>The focus should be on moderating users and content that are intended solely to disrupt the sub.</p>

<p>Conflating that with removing stuff you personally don&#39;t think is worthy is a MASSIVE part of this issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sort-of agree, but I&#39;d like to caution that this can be a slippery slope.</p>

<p>On the one hand, this sub will always be prone to scrutiny and subversion. And cleaning it up would be nice.</p>

<p>On the other hand, first: I already think we have a high level of discourse, at least compared to any other news or political sub.</p>

<p>Second, and more importantly, any censorship has the danger of being used against the community. Even simply the application of the rule you&#39;re suggesting, while perhaps streamlining the discourse could alienate potentially excellent users.</p>

<p>I personally think the community sorts itself rather well with the voting system and I don&#39;t mind off-shoot arguments so long as they&#39;re not just petty or adversarial. And I certainly don&#39;t mind the occasional joke in this often very heavy sub.</p>

<p>The common problem arises, who decides what&#39;s appropriate discourse? I wish we had better controls or support from reddit admin in general. But since that&#39;s clearly not on the horizon I think either everyone or no one should get veto on the comments. Which is basically the voting system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, it would be good. Personally, I would like to be able to throw out &#39;crazy&#39; hypotheses to see if they have any traction without immediately getting negativized karma and no visibility. I guess people think that whenever an idea is &#39;too ludicrous&#39; it ought to be downvoted so as to not besmirch the fine reputation of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and its users as schizophrenic extremists.</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s valid, but without free discussion, how can we hope to crack the puzzle?</p>

<p>As much as the discourse on here supposedly seeks truth, I feel like the majority of the conspiracies presented here climb barely a rung above the MSM-promulgated fairytales. </p>

<p>If we can&#39;t make hypotheses and have them fairly evaluated, this sub is just an RSS-feed of the &quot;top conspiracy blogs&quot;.</p>
