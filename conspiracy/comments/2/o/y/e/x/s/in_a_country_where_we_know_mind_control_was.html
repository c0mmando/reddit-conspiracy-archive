    <div class="md"><p>Some random thoughts. </p>

<p>A highly educated public tends to ask more/better questions of it&#39;s government. Countries with better levels of education tend to have better government.</p>

<p>So when I see a dumbed-down ed system that panders to the lowest common denominator, it&#39;s a concern.</p>

<p>Same thing goes for knowing how your government works. So when I see a population of people that haven&#39;t got the least clue and when I see a government that shrouds itself with the most opaque levels of red tape and bureaucracy... that&#39;s cause for concern as well.</p>

<p>Re: mind control. Whether or not it is possible to achieve mind <em>control</em> is debatable. But it&#39;s well-established that there are many ways to achieve mind <em>influence</em>. We are continuously subjected to various forms of influence every day. Ad agencies try to get us to buy whatever crap by making us believe that certain things are desirable. </p>

<p>You can say the same thing for the powers that be. They use the same techniques to engineer our social attitudes, to get us to think that certain goals or policies are desirable. I&#39;m amazed at the way so many people now think that torture is justified &quot;under the right circumstances&quot;.</p>

<p>This used to be the thing that set some nations apart from others. The bad guys are the ones that use torture, we don&#39;t do that kind of thing because we&#39;re the good guys. Now, we&#39;re the good guys because we only use certain types of torture. If that isn&#39;t a blurred line, I don&#39;t know what is.</p>

<p>It might not be mind control, but it&#39;s a very good example of mental influence.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s the problem.  We have redefined what education actually is.  Education used to be learning technical skills, gaining a command of the language, and learning how to think and solve problems.</p>

<p>Education has become learning technical skills and following increasingly inane and bureaucratic demands from authority figures to prove that you are thinking the &quot;correct&quot; way and have the &quot;appropriate&quot; worldview.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I have certainly noticed a decline in the last few years in class with students lacking (more so than usual) critical thinking on a fantastic level.</p>

<p>When Massachusetts starting requiring a passing grade on the MCAS exam, primary and high school teachers began teaching to the test, as funding for the schools now took passing rates into account.  It is brilliant, really, in a sick, sick way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t need to worry about mind control from the CIA. Not when we are being brainwashed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by the television. You say you haven&#39;t been brainwashed? Brothers, sisters, what you think of as reality has been planted in your heads by those who control the media. They have been controlling the minds of the nations of the West for almost a century. Television is the main organ of control, but before television there was radio, and before radio there were movies, magazines and books. And all of these media have been controlled by Jews for a <em>very long time</em>. The view you have of reality is a Jew-view. It is the view of reality the Jews controlling the media wanted you to have. It is only loosely related to the true and the real.</p>
