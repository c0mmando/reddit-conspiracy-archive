        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01v7ELq5eDo">Proof</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6004489/?ref_=nmbio_trv_6">David Cole</a> first achieved notoriety in 1992 with his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oinItLYg7qQ">interview of Dr. Franciszek Piper</a>, head curator of the Auschwitz State Museum. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3248020/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl">According to imdb</a>, Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a>, a prominent Israeli Holocaust specialist, referred to it as &quot;a powerful and dangerous video.&quot;</p>

<p>In the early 90&#39;s, Cole appeared on several popular TV programs, notably the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx9G4zmpKv0">Montel Williams Show</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUjRIcgtz2Y">Phil Donahue Show</a>. According to Donahue, David Cole is &quot;The Antichrist&quot; and 60 Minutes called him <a href="http://www.countercontempt.com/">a danger to mankind.</a></p>

<p>By 21, he had become infamous as the &quot;Jewish Holocaust denier,&quot; though he explicitly never denied the Holocaust. By 25, he had <a href="http://www.countercontempt.com/">a $25,000 bounty</a> put on his head by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irv_Rubin">Irv Rubin</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Defense_League">Jewish Defense League</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45pf2os5kXQ">Here&#39;s a video</a> of Irv Rubin &quot;not&quot; admitting to punching David in the face. Rubin would later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irv_Rubin">die in jail</a> while awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy to bomb government property.</p>

<p>After finally paying off Rubin, Cole faked his death in San Diego and eventually transformed himself into David Stein.</p>

<p>Listed on imdb as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1783655/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">David Abravanel Stein</a>, he became a respected documentary filmmaker, and produced the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993776/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_1">final film</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Schulberg">Budd Schulberg</a>, who wrote the Academy Award-winning screenplay for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a>.</p>

<p>By the mid-90&#39;s, his travels and research had made him an expert on the Holocaust. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1783655/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">From imdb:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1994 he co-founded the Tinbergen Archives, a Holocaust education institution and research facility in Beverly Hills, California, and he served as its director of operations from 1994 until 2004. </p>

<p>Under David Stein&#39;s directorship, the Tinbergen Archives became one of the leading suppliers of Holocaust education materials to colleges and universities in North America...over the course of the next eight years he produced over a dozen internationally renowned documentary films about the Holocaust, World War II, and the struggle of peoples around the world against racism and intolerance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the 2000&#39;s, David &quot;Stein&quot; <a href="http://www.countercontempt.com">reinvented himself yet again</a> as &quot;a leading Republican Party organizer in LA, working with congressmen, Bush Administration officials, and Hollywood’s top-secret GOP underground (consisting of celebrities like Gary Sinise and Clint Eastwood), while at the same time becoming a leading conservative investigative journalist.&quot;</p>

<p>After becoming a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_Abe">Friends of Abe</a>, a &quot;support group&quot; for the politically conservative Hollywood elite, David formed his own group, the Republican Party Animals.</p>

<p>Despite having established himself as a successful Holocaust documentary filmmaker, he was outed in 2013 by an unhinged ex-girlfriend who revealed his &quot;sordid&quot; past as David Cole, the Holocaust revisionist.</p>

<p>In one fell swoop he was banned by the GOP for life and &quot;David Stein&#39;s&quot; career was ruined.</p>

<p>He was inspired to write a book about his experiences, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Republican-Party-Animal-Hollywoods-Underground/dp/1936239914/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417993258&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=republican+party+animal">Republican Party Animal: The &quot;Bad Boy of Holocaust History&quot; Blows the Lid Off Hollywood&#39;s Secret Right-Wing Underground</a>.</p>

<p>Today, David offers a few updates and anecdotes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/WeAreTheRPA">on his youtube channel</a>, including how he busted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Tolerance">Museum of Tolerance</a> in LA for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PuNPTx8Ki0">using fake footage</a> of Nazi &quot;gas vans&quot; from a 1960&#39;s documentary.</p>

<p>Join us on the 11th as David answers your questions!</p>

<p>This needs to be said. </p>

<p><strong>The mod who pinned this to the top is also responsible for another Holocaust debacle here just recently.</strong></p>

<p>Now I personally welcome these topics but something is off. </p>

<p><a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> — Are you the same mod who was apart of the fake Gage AMA + I&#39;m curious if you also put up the huge red hitler poster on the side bar during September around 9/11? (Edit: you&#39;ve answered yes, so wow what a coincidence)</p>

<p>A lot of unfortunate and timely coincidences ... </p>

<p>I think you are subverting the credibility of this subreddit, distracting discussion from the more important issues, and whether it&#39;s intentional or not does not matter. Especially since you seem to be interested in the fringe side of conspiracies — (Holocaust, Vaccines) <a href="http://imgur.com/phCbSIp">considering your main focus is vaccines.</a></p>

<p><strong>You are not fit to be a mod in my opinion</strong> and should <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nplhx/the_rconspiracy_ama_conspiracy_messages_from/cmfxq4f">accept your resignation.</a></p>

<p>Everyone has their pet theory, your &#39;more important issues&#39; are only more important to you.  </p>

<p>People make mistakes, the GAGE AMA was a fuck up, we learned from it.  The story is over.  Stop manufacturing outrage to try and gain control of this sub.  We won&#39;t be censoring discussion of Holocaust inconsistencies or &quot;antisemitism&quot; as you like to call it.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re offended.  AP only stickied &#39;the greatest story never told&#39; because the community voted on it.  It could have been any one of the mods who did that.

<p>Any comment can be brigaded, so why is your argument any more valid?</p>

<p>Its not anymore valid. In the self post i made titled &quot;Controversial... even for us.&quot; you can see an outpouring of support from names that everyone recognizes as regular users of this sub.  quite the opposite of the 1-3 month old accounts that seem to want to start trouble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, that&#39;s your problem. You&#39;re not open minded and that&#39;s because you were born a Jew. You can consider many different possibilities, but as soon as the concept of Jew as oppressor comes up, your mind shuts down. &quot;Anti-Semitism&quot; is a word used to control goyim. You should know this, if you haven&#39;t been told outright. If you can&#39;t handle Jew-wise discussion, then perhaps you should stop being interested in justice and freedom OR stop identifying as a Jew. </p>

<p>You may have been born to Jews and carry Ashkenazi/Khazar/&quot;Israelite&quot; DNA, which you couldn&#39;t control. But you choose every day to <strong>continue</strong> to identify with Jews. It completely boggles my mind! In today&#39;s information age, that is like signing a contract to the Jewish collective guilt day after day. If I were you, I&#39;d drop my ID Cards and make a beeline as far away as I could from this ultimate evil. The elite caste of a few ruling the masses through manipulation of facts, subterfuge and usury is called <strong>Zionism</strong>... It makes no sense to me! When the truth finally comes out, you don&#39;t want to be associated with the men at the end of our pitchforks. </p>

<p>The negative scores on your comments and <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> comments are NOT evidence of brigading.</p>

<p>We all aren&#39;t stupid.</p>

<p>Not even close. I&#39;ve addressed all these issues many, many times already. It&#39;s just getting a little old.</p>

<p>One or two users here seem unwilling to let it go.</p>

<p>I admitted my hand in the Gage AMA. I <em>shared</em> fault in that debacle, but if anything, I learned from the experience and will be a better mod as a result.</p>

<p>The stupid Hitler documentary is old news as well.</p>

<p>I resurrected the featured documentary vote earlier this year. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/2bs5zp/rconspiracy_documentary_of_the_week_archive/">I&#39;ve also been keeping a list</a> of these community-chosen documentaries. </p>

<p>The Hitler documentary won quite easily. However, the voting thread was being brigaded by <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and the like, so the thread was taken down to prevent the scores from being altered any further.</p>

<p>I thought the film was dramatic and irresponsibly sourced, however, it was the community&#39;s choice. </p>

<p>After viewing the ridiculous foofaraw that resulted from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> featuring the film, I was glad it won, even though I didn&#39;t particularly care for the film.</p>

<p>It was incredible to me how many jimmies were rustled over something so inconsequential and ephemeral as a documentary featured on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>As for the image, <em>this was the documentary cover</em>. Every time a documentary is featured, the cover of the dvd or official movie poster is used as the sidebar image.</p>

<p>When enough people requested that it be removed, I switched it with another (lower quality) image that had the movie&#39;s title instead.</p>

<p>As far as the sidebar image goes, at any given time, 90% of the sidebar pictures are chosen by myself and just one other mod. </p>

<p>Right now, for example, I chose the sidebar image. I&#39;ve picked hundreds.</p>

<p>The only time there&#39;s ever been a complaint was with the dvd cover of that hitler documentary. When enough people complained, I switched it. End of story.</p>

<p>Let me know if I missed anything.</p>

<p>You conconted 1 sentence &#39;explaining&#39; the fake Richard Gage AMA (we noticed you didn&#39;t say <em>fake</em> Gage AMA, but Gage AMA) while you made 11 more sentence structures around a Hitler picture/doc, which was put up the exact same time as <a href="/u/thefuckingtoe">/u/thefuckingtoe</a>&#39;s stickied post about 9/11 truth (during the anniversary of 9/11). </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t raise a stink when it was fairly obvious that the image of Hitler was being used to nope casual browsers right the fuck out of the sub during the 9/11 anniversary. Obvious set up is obvious set up. </p>

<p>If you put as much thought into your willingness to single-handedly ruin the sub through bad mod actions as you do with your brilliant vaccine threads, you&#39;d be a very different mod. </p>

<p>With all due respect, you&#39;re a great contributor but a horrible mod.</p>

<p>I now see where some of your frustration/bitterness is coming from.</p>

<p>I remember that post, it was really well done.</p>

<p>This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, it doesn&#39;t have to be the week of September 11th for there to be a quality 9/11 sticky.</p>

<p>Submit it again, message the mods for a sticky request, and I see no reason why it shouldn&#39;t be featured.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid even I find it a stretch that there would be a connection between that featured documentary and your 9/11 post.</p>

<p>Start now.  Answer my questions from 11 days ago.</p>

<p>I will remain suspicious of your involvement <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> until I have reviewed the data for myself.  I will not blindly accept, and I am cautious of all that tell me otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A fake twitter account was made and a promise was give that a confirmation tweet would be linked on the day of the AMA.</p>

<p>This twitter account (it looked something like aefor911truth) has since been deleted.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where the discrepancy between the mods came from. There was a lot of confusion about what actually occurred when this first went down.</p>

<p>A twitter account was used, but no tweets were tweeted.</p>

<p>I exchanged PMs and one or two emails (from a gmail account) with the perpetrators of the hoax. I also was by no means the only mod in correspondence with them.</p>

<p>I messed up, but we all collectively share the blame.</p>

<p>Having personally arranged the first AMA with Linda Brown earlier this year, I was overzealous in getting the second AMA going.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even going to come close to happening again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m beginning to think the timing of these attacks, the age of all the various accounts doing the attacking, and even the fake Gage AMA are all related.</p>

<p>Assuredly:</p>

<p>The mod who was responsible for coordinating the AMA will certainly elaborate on what proof they were given, and why they believed the AMA to be legit; but I cannot speak for them. </p>

<p>Flytape:</p>

<p>You pinned this to the top right after 9/11. Great timing. Coincidence?

<p><strong>I&#39;m curious if you also put up the huge red hitler poster on the side bar during September which got removed?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what 90% of the people who have a problem with this guy, and people of similar opinion do not get.  They think &quot;holocaust deniers&quot; are Nazis, or Anti-Semites.  I have listened to many people talk about this subject, with varying degrees of &quot;belief&quot; in the accuracy of the &quot;facts&quot; portrayed by the West about the Holocaust.  Generally, the main discrepancy is the fact that PEOPLE AREN&quot;T ALLOWED TO CONDUCT RESEARCH, DEBATES, OR OPEN CONVERSATION ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST, one of the most important events in history.  Out of any event in history, this should be the one <strong>MOST</strong> studied, but instead, it is ILLEGAL in many countries to do so(and frowned upon in the rest).  I really don&#39;t understand why people are trying to cover this up if there is nothing to cover up.  Let people learn, teach, debate, and gather information, like every other event in History(except 9/11 and JFK) so that we can learn from it.  Unless one fears the truth, there is no reason to NOT allow open debate(which is all that these people want most of the time).  We still to this day revise almost every other event in, and aspect of history.  Why make the holocaust the exception?  Why did we record this one event in history 100% correct, when time has shown we NEVER get it right the first time, and HISTORICAL REVISIONS are necessary in almost every case as technology, and our ability to piece together evidence increases with time.</p>

<p>Are we just making shit up now?  Are you sure that you didn&#39;t fake the Gage AMA so that you could also be the hero who discovered it was fake so that you could spear head this outrage movement to try and get rid of conspiracy mods?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s only &#39;sketchy&#39; because it&#39;s a topic that seems too taboo to be allowed to be researched, which makes all the information about it inherently &#39;sketchy&#39; to begin with. It&#39;s a cyclical defence.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not even a rational reason for this, as there&#39;s been much larger, focused genocides through history that aren&#39;t taboo to history researchers - which to me makes the taboo of the topic more sketchy than the attempted to validation of it.</p>

<p>If it happened how we&#39;re told it has happened, then research should only prove it all the more correct. This is how science progresses, falsification. Falsification is good, if something can be shown to not be accurate, we move closer to the truth of something. If something can not be falsified, we also move closer to the truth. Everyone should be interested in the truth, irrespective of who it offends - and if the truth offends someone, what are they gaining but keeping it in the dark?</p>

<p>I get you&#39;re saying that why should it be pinned, thus forced upon the sub - well why shouldn&#39;t it? And then why should anything be pinned then? What gives one topic more validity over another. As people have pointed out there&#39;s a lot of discussion in this thread about it. I grew up being taught in school that this was 100% what happened, 6 million, only Jews, ect. However, that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case, so what else potentially might have been exaggerated? </p>

<p>Edit: Expanded, grammar.</p>

<p>If Judy Wood is a fool, then by all means let her state her case here, and <em>you</em> will have the opportunity to strike it down <em>personally</em>.</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s</em> the beauty of these AMAs. That&#39;s why you should <em>relish</em> the opportunity to directly call out someone like David Cole or Judy Wood.</p>

<p>mass ban?</p>

<p>Two users were banned. One of them has had previous accounts banned on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and other subs (such as 911truth).</p>

<p>After the mods discussed it, one of these two users&#39; bans was revoked. We&#39;ll see what happens to the other account.</p>

<p>I&#39;m at a loss as to how this possibly could be referred to as a &quot;mass ban.&quot;</p>

<p>alllie was given a temporary ban and a warning because she was out of control and harassing users in that thread. Her ban is not permanent.</p>

<p>I see you edited your comment from &quot;Is it because you have none?&quot; to &quot;Is it because you have none just like Just Wood?&quot;</p>

<p>Why you edited your original comment to bring some unrelated person&#39;s credibility into the equation is beyond me. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t speak for Judy Wood. Can I speak for myself?</p>

<p>As far as credibility goes, I&#39;ve been posting &quot;conspiratorial&quot; material to reddit for longer than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has even been around.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in the top 3 contributors to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of all time (or at least I was last year before I became a moderator and slowed down my submissions).</p>

<p>I was overwhelmingly elected as mod by the community because of my dedication to this sub.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve compiled more original research for the sole benefit of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> than almost any other user.</p>

<p>I know the history. I&#39;ve seen the drama. I&#39;ve been attacked by <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and their ilk for years. I&#39;ve been threatened. My family has been threatened. </p>

<p>Over the years, I&#39;ve developed thicker and thicker skin. </p>

<p>These latest fiascoes will only reinforce that.</p>

<p>Just the other day, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/1wHaw">a book was released</a> that was inspired by the original content of 101 reddit users. </p>

<p>As you can see by the image, I was one of those users. Apparently, my work on the Bearer Bonds scandal and breakaway civilization was good enough to get my reddit user name featured in a book.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve written things in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/21rpeg/so_my_high_octane_speculation_about_the/">that have been picked up by Time.com, CNN and the Colbert Report</a>.</p>

<p>Can you imagine how I felt when Stephen Colbert quoted something I had written on <em>reddit</em>?</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned. I couldn&#39;t be more qualified to be a moderator of this sub.</p>

<p>If I fuck up again, that&#39;s a different story.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done a lot of good for this place, and I plan to do much more.</p>

<p><strong>Your &#39;credentials&#39; may have gotten you a mod position but your work after the fact has shown you are not fit for the job</strong>.

    <div class="md"><p>With respect to your edit regarding Judy Wood, <a href="http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/a/bio/Wood_Bio.html">here&#39;s your answer about her credentials:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Judy Wood earned a Ph.D. Degree from Virginia Tech and is a former professor of mechanical engineering. She has research expertise in experimental stress analysis, structural mechanics, deformation analysis, materials characterization and materials engineering science. Her research has involved testing materials, including complex-material systems, in the area of photomechanics, or the use of optical and image-analysis methods to determine physical properties of materials and measure how materials respond to forces placed on them. </p>

<p>Her area of expertise involves interferometry in forensic science. She taught graduate and undergraduate engineering classes and has authored or co-authored over 60 peer-reviewed papers and journal publications in her areas of expertise.</p>

<p>In the time since 9/11/01, she has applied her expertise in materials science, image analysis and interferometry, to a forensic study of over 40,000 images, hundreds of video clips, a large volume of witness testimony, analyses of dust samples, seismic data, and the analysis of other environmental evidence pertaining to the destruction of the World Trade Center complex. </p>

<p>Dr. Wood has conducted a comprehensive forensic investigation of what physically happened to the World Trade Center site on 9/11. And, based on her analysis of the evidence she gathered, in 2007, she filed a federal Qui Tam case for science fraud against the contractors who contributed to the official National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) report about the destruction of the World Trade Center towers. This case was filed in the US Supreme Court in Dec 2009.</p>

<p>Dr. Wood received her:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>B.S. (Civil Engineering, 1981) (Structural Engineering),</p>

<p>M.S. (Engineering Mechanics (Applied Physics), 1983), and</p>

<p>Ph.D. (Materials Engineering Science, 1992) from the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Her dissertation involved the development of an experimental method to measure thermal stresses in bimaterial joints. She has taught courses including:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Experimental Stress Analysis,</p>

<p>Engineering Mechanics,</p>

<p>Mechanics of Materials (Strength of Materials)</p>

<p>Strength of Materials Testing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judy D. Wood is a former professor of mechanical engineering with research interests in experimental stress analysis, structural mechanics, optical methods, deformation analysis, and the materials characterization of biomaterials and composite materials. </p>

<p>he is a member of the Society for Experimental Mechanics (SEM), co-founded SEM’s Biological Systems and Materials Division, and has served on the SEM Composite Materials Technical Division.</p>

<p>From 1999 to 2006 Dr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. Before moving to Clemson she spent three years as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Tech.</p>

<p>One of Dr. Wood&#39;s research interests is biomimicry, or applying the mechanical structures of biological materials to engineering design using engineering materials. Other recent research has investigated the deformation behavior of materials and structures with complex geometries and complex material properties, such as fiber-reinforced composite materials and biological materials. </p>

<p>Dr. Wood is an expert in the use of moiré interferometry, a full-field optical method that is used in stress analysis, as well as materials characterization and other types of interference. In recent years, Dr. Wood and her students have developed optical systems with various wavelengths and waveguides. </p>

<p>Dr. Wood has over 60 technical publications in refereed journals, conference proceedings, and edited monographs and special technical reports.</p>

<p>Dr. Wood started to question the events of 9/11 on that same day when what she saw and heard on television was contradictory and appeared to violate the laws of physics. </p>

<p>Since that day she has used her knowledge of engineering mechanics to prove that the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers could not have happened as the American public was told.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeah, she definitely has more credibility than I do.</p>

(Note how in his YT video he says &quot;deniers&quot; are &quot;crazy as fuck&quot;.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[edit: deleted a couple of quotes from the review after someone pointed out how they took what Mr Cole wrote in his book out of context.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://holocausthoaxmuseum.com/response-to-david-cole/"><strong>Filmmaker Eric Hunt&#39;s response to Mr Cole</strong></a>, regarding Cole&#39;s position on Treblinka-II, is also worth reading. [edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R6mTTrOlzE">link to Hunt&#39;s latest documentary, just released</a>.]</p>

<p>With that disclaimer, his 1992 documentary was (at the time) groundbreaking, and is excellent viewing for those new to the topic. I expect Mr Cole will have a few interesting things to say about Auschwitz, and the Holoco$t industry. (Just don&#39;t expect him to endorse &#39;9/11 Truth&#39;!)</p>

<p>I&#39;d just be far more excited if a &quot;real&quot; revisionist -- someone like Germar Rudolf, or Carlo Mattogno, or Jurgen Graf, or Carlos Porter (or even Eric Hunt) -- were to do do an AMA - perhaps that&#39;s something the mods could arrange?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>and Cole lambasts the Canadian legal system for having given Zündel the opportunity to contest the charge that he was “spreading false news”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That really mischaracterizes what David Cole said about the Zündel trial.</p>

<p>Cole was just noting the irony of imprisoning someone for spreading certain ideas and then allowing that person to mount a huge trial in defense of those ideas thereby bringing them more attention. Cole does resent Zündel to some degree because he considers him a Hitler apologist, but he totally opposed Zündel&#39;s persecution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cole sums up: “Maybe some Holocaust claims were overstated, but isn’t a little overstatement worth it to fight fascism?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is taken out of context. Cole was explaining why that reasoning is <em>not</em> persuasive to him. </p>

<p>Any idea who he is referring to here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It should also be remembered that it was Australian Revisionist Richard Krege who in 1999 pioneered the Ground Penetrating Radar research at Treblinka, which was partially duplicated by a UK researcher, whose results have, like the Hayward work was, been embargoed for five years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know about Krege, but who is this UK researcher whose results have been embargoed? Is he talking about Caroline Sturdy Colls? What is the embargo?</p>

<p>Perhaps the work done for her was never released, and that&#39;s what he&#39;s talking about? Would make sense, as from what was shown, it seemed to confirm the revisionist assertion that there is no evidence of extensive soil disturbance.</p>

<p>If he won&#39;t debate on the radio, I&#39;m done with him. People can see through his indefensible nonsense. Even he can, which is why he is dodging a moderated radio debate.</p>

<p>He pinned this on top of the subreddit during September. <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hczx1/adolf_hitler_the_greatest_story_never_told_2013/">http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hczx1/adolf_hitler_the_greatest_story_never_told_2013/</a></p>

<p>Do you really think this type of distraction is a coincidence?  Being a mod at 9/11 truth, you know the movement was doing great things the last quarter of 2014, but the opportune time was wasted with this Holocaust stuff.  I&#39;m curious if he was also responsible huge red hitler poster on the side bar during September which got removed?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nplhx/the_rconspiracy_ama_conspiracy_messages_from/cmfxq4f">The whole botched AMA with Richard Gage he helped set up was a complete disaster.</a> --  You probably agree.  Plus, I&#39;ve worked with Gage personally, so I take his role in that AMA debacle very seriously.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/phCbSIp">His main focus is vaccines</a> -- <strong>a very convoluted and sticky subject</strong> <em>EVEN FOR THE CONSPIRACY COMMUNITY</em>.  Having this whole subreddit focus on the Holocaust stuff is like having the whole 9/11 truth movement discuss what happened in Shanksville -- it distracts from the juicier and better proven conspiracies.</p>

<p>I think he has done nothing but lose credibility for this subreddit, and continuously distracted from important/current conspiracies that the sheep are starting to wake up to, which stifles any real progress in the community.  </p>

<p>It does not matter whether he is doing it intentionally or not, he should not be a mod IMO.</p>

<p>Shame me? That&#39;s grand.</p>

<p>Why did I bring up 9/11 victims one might ask? </p>

<p>The mod in question decided to &quot;ok&quot; a Hitler movie ( with a brigade&#39;s blessing) in early September when there was a nice stickied post about 9/11 truth that would be ignored if not for Hitler&#39;s big red sidebar image.</p>

<p>You think I&#39;m low for mentioning those not with us anymore who need justice to be served?</p>

<p>You think I&#39;m low for continuously demanding that a certain mod step down who helped ruin the 9/11 truth movement on reddit?</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t thinking. You are defending people that hurt the chance for justice for the dead victims of 9/11. </p>

<p>You are in essence defending the perps. Think about that.</p>

<p>Edit: in <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>, <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2ooful/david_colestein_holocaust_revisionist_filmmaker/cmqb1mb">I smacked down Kevin Ryan&#39;s bullshit <em>another 19</em> , susan lindauer&#39;s non-story with no evidence, and judy wood</a></p>

<p>IMHO you chase relevant contributors of 911 truth away which in turn pushes the dead victims of 911 farther away from justice. Plus you are helping to preserve a mod squad that ok&#39;d the fact that real Richard Gage confirmed he will not have an AMA on this sub. Sowing the seeds of doubt</p>

<p>Cheers to the perps and their entourage. And fuck conspiratards too. You all are here to help the perps in a distraction technique pretty obvious to the casual observer. One need not believe in any one conspiracy to see that this sub is gamed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of this holocaust revision stuff is not only pointless, but it serves to discredit the whole sub. And rightfully so! This whole sub has been taken over by hordes of accounts that operate at the same times and up vote this garbage in the middle of the night. They chased away all of the subs regulars and even got mod positions, inexplicably. I&#39;ve been posting in this sub for about 3 or 4 years now and 2 years ago it was much, much different. Obviously not under the same account because my previous account was banned for having a dissenting opinion about the stickied Hitler documentary. What to do? I don&#39;t want to bail on the sub but literally everything that gets up voted now (by brigades) is complete fucking nonsense. Rule 1! Rule 8! And fuck rule 10. This sub is 6 feet under. </p>

<p>I have never put much time into investigating the holocaust so I can&#39;t say either way but for some reason for me it seems easier to accept that 911 was an inside job rather than the holocaust being fabricated. Perhaps this phenomena has been utilised to discredit this sub for newcomers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot really censor this subreddit blatantly so subtle subversion is the only way. Mistakes at critical times, or distractions at vitals moments in time. Stuff like the holocaust doesn&#39;t hold much weight considering the evidence for it being faked/exaggerated isn&#39;t anything like the thousands of documents, videos, interviews, whistleblowers involved with the 9/11 side. The guys setting up this AMA are the ones responsible for faking a 9/11 truth AMA with a group that had spent millions on advertisements that year. The difference in size and credibility of the two people in these AMAs couldn&#39;t be farther apart. </p>

<p>The holocaust poster and hitler doc posted you speak of was thrown up during September and overtook the place of a really great 9/11 documentary. This happened around the 15th and was executed horribly. Discredited the sub, turned away new comers, and created a pit of irrelevance at a crucial moment in time. Coincidence?</p>

<p>Because they simply are not relevant. Yes, he posts a variety of stuff. This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and it&#39;s the kind of stuff we discuss here.

<p>It&#39;s not the &quot;focus&quot;. There is no single issue that this sub focuses on. However, it is discussed frequently because many believe the official story is propaganda spread by conspirators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first introduction to David Cole came back in ~2000. I was graduating college and was on a recruiting trip with Dell Computer in Austin, Texas. There were maybe 100 other people my age there, so of course we hit up 6th street and partied our tails off - Cole would have been proud at how much I had to drink. I met a little sweetheart from UVA and we ended up in the hotel room for some whatever. After we were finished I put on the tv and somehow ended up on a University of Texas public access channel. What was on but David Cole giving a tour of Auschwitz. I was so enthralled in my post-still-kinda drunken/horny stupor. So it&#39;s been a hobby of mine to see what Cole was up to every few years, mostly because it took me back to that night. Of course he vanished after &quot;recanting&quot; (before 2000) but I was overjoyed to see that he was back in 2013 (sorry for his situation though). His book is A+ and I strongly recommend. Can&#39;t wait for this. Thanks for helping me get laid, Cole, even if it was indirectly. I owe you a vodka or 2 for that.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this the same guy that claims that there are 900,000 bodies buried at Madonik in Poland which CANNOT be found with LIDAR or GPR?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re thinking of Treblinka. Cole doesn&#39;t believe anyone was gassed at Majdanek.</p>

<p>He does believe Jews were were sent to Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec and Chelmo to be exterminated. Here is what he said in his book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1942 through 1943, Polish Jewry was subjected to one of the most brutal campaigns of mass murder in human history. Because of the secrecy surrounding those four extermination camps [Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, and Chelmno], and the fact that they were ploughed under and erased from existence in 1943, it’s difficult to be precise about certain details. And we do know that some Jews were sent to those camps as a throughway to other destinations (as recounted multiple times in Gerald Reitlinger’s 1953 masterwork The Final Solution). But, more than enough circumstantial evidence exists to show that for most Jews, the train ride to those camps was one-way, and final.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t make him not worth listening to. </p>

<p>David Cole makes a very convincing case that there were no homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz, the most famous camp. </p>

<p>If Cole&#39;s view, that Auschwitz never operated as an extermination camp, becomes accepted in the mainstream that would be a huge coup for Holocaust revisionism. And revisionist arguments about the Operation Reinhard camps would have a much better chance of being taken seriously.</p>

<p>Do they? Heh. Well, anybody who actually knows anything about revisionist scholarship certainly wouldn&#39;t be looking for Cole to fulfill this role.</p>

<p>Especially when revisionism has it&#39;s Faurissons and Rudolfs. Cole has never published, and his sole contribution is a 20+ year-old video. He&#39;s had a difficult time of things, and now he&#39;s trying to sell a tabloidy book. There&#39;s really not much more to say about him.</p>

<p>And yet it was Cole who managed to single-handedly put the subject center-stage in the national media. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Single-handedly? Hardly. His video in the early 90&#39;s was after the furor over the Zundel trial (mid-to-late 80&#39;s) and the &#39;Faurisson affair&#39; (starting late 70&#39;s).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How will the revisionist movement fight the universities, museums and other institutions that have a budget of 100&#39;s millions of dollars at their command for their output, with this type of attitude?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Challenging everybody and everything is precisely the attitude necessary to undermine the corrupt institutional propaganda-mythology. Cole doesn&#39;t get a pass because he made a video. His position now is ridiculous, harmful to serious revisionism, and deeply suspicious. I still have sympathy for the guy, don&#39;t get me wrong, but in his place I wouldn&#39;t be engaging in slanderous attacks on people like Faurisson, or attempting to make a bizarre case that the Reinhardt camps are legit. I mean, unless I were under some sort of duress...</p>

thanks, and to show good faith, my real name is mark, im tall and sexy too ;)
again my humblest apologies.</em></p>

<p>First off, don’t ban me bro…. I mean well, I swear on my nuts.</p>

<p>Secondly, theres no dichotomy for me bud. truth is not encapsulated within a pet peeve, or personal mission, its is a continuum therefore a perpetual struggle.  How a person genuinely interested in truth could not be compelled to investigate 9/11 while claiming to be compelled towards purifying corrupted and manipulated narratives defies a rational explanation, at least I cannot think of one, maybe you can enlighten me.<br/>
It would be like a self-professed “compassionate healthcare professional” devoting his life to eradicating and understanding  the Spanish flu and not being at all inspired to investigate cancer, that is, If the aim is to improve <em>health</em> .  Caring only about Spanish flu doesn’t mean he cares about health, it means he only cares about Spanish flu.  </p>

<p>While mr. a.k.a.  can talk and care about whatever he wants, and I support him this unalienable right, he cannot claim to be about “the” truth inside of self-imposed artificial boundaries when “the” truth extends into the rest of time and space, this is why to me 911 is a benchmark for a “truther” of any tilt.  And for that argument that is quite surely bubbling up into your gullet right now, one can still have other pursuits beyond the study of 911 and otherwse.  One need not have to understand differential equations and lock themselves into a dungeon to be able to understand how pathetically obvious it is that the “official” <em>story</em> is an outright and bold-faced lie.  </p>

<p>The evidence is so available and reliable and much of the compositions of such so convenient and well worn, that the path to the obvious is practically a laser straight pristine 4 lane highway leading right to Washington dc, passing by every major media outlet rest stop on the way and slamming into the first floor of pentagon (leaving the lawn unscathed of course).  While it can be logically inferred that the back roads may squirrel around into the enclaves of foreign ministries, like those of Israeli or  Saudi Arabian composition, and surely more to come, step one is the most indispensible.  and that is to finally show the dumb-massed droned-out idolaters  of what is sarcastically referrd to as the beacon of freedom and justice, and incidentally that pay the bills and fill the graves for this demonic process, that, “YES, BRO’S N HOES, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BE LIED TO ON A MASSIVE SCALE!! Your heroes are not for you, you are for them, and the ultimate truth of truths for the foundation of a civilized evolved humanity is that war, deceit and suffering are not caused by religion, nor nationhood, nor skin color, or any other contrived team sport, it is and has been caused by “leaders” and our slack-jawed trust of them.  the only thing you need to lead you are your basic intellectual  faculties invigorated by literacy and self-esteem.  </p>

<p>Learn to read/communicate and respect yourself, everything else will fall into place, <em>believe me</em> hehe.</p>

<p>You wanna hear my conspiracy theory brother (or sister?), we are being sigh-opped(sic), its gladio z, the final strategy of tension.  The use all of these disparate poster-bored issues that are currently wallpapering the halls of justice.  That’s why we have wikileaks taking a leak all over our faces, and Edward snowjob making us snow blind, wittingly or otherwise, doesn’t matter, they serves a purpose otherwise they would be deader than henry kissinger’s dick.  They and other the glut of truth-spammers are there to add more and more odd-shaped and incongruent objects, real or imagined, for us to juggle until we’re overwhelmed and it all falls down upon our, and eachothers’ heads, keeping us confused, distracted and exhausted, and ultimately separated from eachother, rather than in pursuit of the most important, available and powerful goal, the one thread that weaves all of the perpetraitors into one giant fabric, the one mega lie all of the alpha’s agree on perpetuating and thereby tipping their hands as co-conspirators.  It is the one major wind that waves all of the other false flags, justifies and enables all of the other necessary evils, i.e., the war on terror, torture, secrecy, invasion of privacy, scientific/professional fraud, media public manipulaton, etc etc. but by far the most devious and long-standing charade.. . that our alphas love “us,” and are critical to our development, security and happiness. </p>

<p>911 is the guy fawkes mask of our era, the barret .50 cal (with an acog scope) head shot of our time, ultimately our modern day m.o.a.b. the mother of all bonds.  all of this impact wrapped in a nice neat convenient package, that is easy to understand, that affects us all, evin da far’ners, and all you have to do is harp on it to your friends and fams, and whoever else, do not deviate, don’t confuse them with crisis actors and ufo’s, that will all come out later.  but don’t let them rest, use the tools of the trade, repetition and nagging, until they will finally sit down and look for themselves, then sit back and watch as they stop drooling over o’bomba, or hellary or shill maher, etc.   And the irony is that solving the crime is not even that important in the short run, its about exposing the underlying lyingy lying lies and lyingly liars that keep them mesmerized and ineffectual. all you have to do is prove that 9/11 was a lie, and they all fall down like the toy soldiers they are.</p>

<p>So like I said IF this guy says he doesn’t understand the power and prescience  of 9/11, and judging by the last decade, how could you not, then he’s an idiot or a liar. I can see no excuse for ignorance in an information age.</p>

<p>TLDR; the most important information is that which is most empowering and relevant, which dispels the most falsehood and to me, currently theres no other truth that can as efficiently nuke and sink the politico-media armada of treachery and deceit as instantaneously as 9/11 truth.  And if I may quote Michael brown’s ever-so eloquent step-dadsta, “BURN THIS BITCH DOWWNNN!!!” (repeat chorus)</p>

<p>Thanks, I love you guys, I really do. Peace</p>

<p>Oh and btw, axltotl peylopty, I really do enjoy your posts, they are very relevant and engaging, I shudder to think of your impact if you really pushed for the exposition of… dare I say it again..??  /jamesearljonesvoice/  “911 TrRrRruuuutthhhh /jamesearljonesvoice/  peace bro (or sis).</p>

<p>David Cole doing an AMA here isn&#39;t really a big deal. If he&#39;s scum, he&#39;ll be exposed as scum. If he&#39;s level-headed and reasonable, why write him off completely?</p>

<p>I should stress that David Cole himself thinks Holocaust deniers are scum.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear. He believes there were 4 Nazi extermination camps. The official number is 6. </p>

<p>He&#39;s basically saying two camps weren&#39;t used for genocide, and four were.</p>

<p>He has an interesting life story as well. It&#39;s just an AMA. Next week we&#39;ll announce the next person and this will be forgotten by almost everyone.</p>

<p>Especially after your fake Gage AMA, admitting to posting the red hitler poster in September, and now responsible for 2 holocaust revisionism stickies, one of which took the place of a 9/11 doc right around 9/11. </p>

<p>Your friend FlyTape banned me for expressing my concerns, along with other users. You guys&#39; actions as mods are the epitome of what we are trying to fight against. Resign. Feel free to post your vaccine stuff, just stop forcing fringe conspiracies on the front page while censoring public upheaval about it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious, fellow intellectual, do you feel the same way about Strasserist Nationalist-Socialism?</p>

<p>What do you think of Hitler&#39;s 16-point plan for the resolution of the Danzig/corridor issue?</p>

<p>If &quot;Hitler&quot; had been trying to &quot;take over the world&quot; in 1939, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a bit strange he hadn&#39;t ordered the production of long-range strategic bombers, etc?</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, and obviously I&#39;d be interested to hear your take on the Geneva disarmament conference. Why was France so keen to sabotage proposals that other European powers follow Germany&#39;s lead and actually comply with their Treaty of Versailles obligations?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think that any of these people have heard of &quot;The Bromberg Massacre&quot;--which pretty much forced Hitler&#39;s hand with the Polish Jews? When the Jewish partisans hear Hitler&#39;s army was coming through to rescue these Germans they killed 6,000 Germans wholesale. On one day. Cut babies out of wombs, raped and then blew out the women&#39;s brains, and killed every male between infancy and adulthood.</p>

<p>No trial.</p>

<p>No ceremony.</p>

<p>Just shot in the backs of the head to fall into mass graves.</p>

<p><em>They were killing ethnic Germans for no reason.</em> Hitler tried diplomacy MANY times...in the end an invasion was the only thing left to do to save his people.</p>

<p>Sorry people. Truth strikes again.</p>

<p>So, yeaaaah, I think what <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> put up was quite significant...and the movie even more enlightening.</p>

<p>Just because we&#39;re Jewish doesn&#39;t mean SOME JEWS collect &quot;sins&quot; like boys collect baseball cards. It sure seems that way though. Shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. The Bromberg atrocities took place right <em>after</em> the German attack began. But before this, there were also countless accounts of atrocities - the &quot;Polish&quot; media began a hate campaign against NS Germany and Germans within Poland, increasing in intensity after the British guarantee in 1939, (after which it became fairly clear that the British-US-French-Polish strategy was to provoke Germany into making the first move.)</p>

<p><a href="http://justice4germans.com/2013/02/24/video-1939-german-news-report-on-ethnic-german-refugees-from-poland/">Plenty of ethnic Germans were forced to abandon their possessions and flee Poland</a>. It wasn&#39;t just ethnic Germans that were persecuted, but other minorities too - Ukrainians especially - and also a lot of Jews chose to emigrate to Germany in the 30&#39;s.</p>

<p>With a 30-35% minority-ethnic population, a tradition of xenophobia, and an aggressive, nationalistic regime, when the country was formed in 1919, there was also a <a href="http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/eehistory/H200Readings/Topic5-R1.html">Minority Protection Treaty</a> created, which was officially abandoned in 1934. Poland was basically seen as a bit of a rogue state back in those days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re a Hitler lover too.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see, who supported Hitler? Parts of the American plutocracy because they loved Hitler&#39;s attacking and murdering communists, socialists, democratic socialists and trade unionists, the first people he had arrested, imprisoned, tortured and killed. The editor of the arch conservative Readers Digest even let slip during WWII that he hoped Hitler won.</p>

<p>Who might want to rehabilitate Nazism now? The CIA and American plutocracy so their support for Ukrainian neo Nazis would be less controversial.</p>

<p>Lol. By 1939 there were 10,000 people in the concentration camps. Most of them were criminals. In a country of 60 million. Hitler made it a rule that police couldn&#39;t carry clubs, as they had in the Weimar period -- how&#39;s that for a &quot;terror state&quot;?</p>

<p>Hitler <em>nationalized</em> the trade unions, because union leaders were corrupt, and influenced by Moscow. He enacted workers rights reforms, and social welfare reforms the likes of which we can only dream of now in Western nations. Workers and farmers were the main supporters of the NSDAP. It was a socialist party, &quot;true socialism&quot; as they said, and indigenous to Germany unlike internationalist Bolshevism.</p>

<p>Who <em>actually</em> financed the NSDAP? It&#39;s possibly too complex for you to be interested in, but just in case:</p>

<p>Heh. Okay, well... that&#39;s a very extreme position to take.

Our earthly kingdom will be ruled by our leader with a rod of iron. The masses will lick our feet and serve us as our slaves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t that an antisemetic conspiracy theory in itself?</p>

<p>Why is it so hard to understand that people who believe that all European Jews all got together to lie that their families died in concentration camps might also think that all Jews are bad people (aka. antisemitism)?</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that it is another set of Jewish lies and schemes to associate Holocaust revisionism with antisemitism?  That&#39;s just another thick layer of antisemitism. </p>

<p>The thing is, it&#39;s not so much a lie as a rumor that got supported by Allied propaganda. Read this book:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vho.org/aaargh/fran/livres5/crowellholmes.pdf">http://www.vho.org/aaargh/fran/livres5/crowellholmes.pdf</a></p>

<p>BBC was broadcasting the rumor back into Poland starting in 1942. They even dropped leaflets telling people that it was definitely happening. If you watch &quot;survivor&quot; accounts, they mostly seemed to believe it. (Need I point out that no genuine &quot;survivor&quot; ever saw a gas chamber?)</p>

<p>But, I can also understand angry-confused-vengeful people, having been locked up in those camps, lying and exaggerating &quot;to make the Nazis pay&quot;, especially when encouraged to do so by Soviet commissars, Allied propaganda officers, or Jewish Nuremberg prosecutors/investigators.</p>

<p>Considering the inconsistency and physical implausibilities of pretty much all alleged witness testimonies, when read in their totality (i.e. what&#39;s left out of the mainstream history books) -- plus the lack of any documentary or forensic evidence which proves gassings, this is the most obvious explanation. (Not to mention the showtrials, government announcements, newspaper articles - etc - which gave the rumor the veneer of Official History.) I mean, it&#39;s hardly unthinkable that governments might conspire to lie about their enemies, and take the attention off their own heinous war crimes...</p>

<p>&quot;I disagree with your interpretation of a historical event that happened 70 years ago&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you sir are a bigot&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t deny the holocaust at all but I believe people should have a right to do so. I don&#39;t see a problem with it. Unless they&#39;re advocating killing or oppressing Jews or claiming Jews are inferior or something I don&#39;t think questioning the holocaust makes them necessarily anti-semitic.</p>

<p>Related: Palestinians are Semites, yet anti-Palestinian bigotry is not considered &#39;anti-semitism&#39;. Why is anti-semitism considered bigotry solely against Jews?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; as user through_a_ways <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2dda6l/the_somewhat_new_meaning_of_antisemite/cjoucnx">pointed out in a thread a few months back</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and there are anti-Semites pretend to just have a problem with Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure there are, but there are a lot of things that get brandied around as &quot;antisemitic&quot; that aren&#39;t necessarily antisemitic at all. Like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Criticizing the largely Jewish-run film industry for its &quot;blacklisting&quot; of celebrities who support the Palestinian cause. Recognizing that an industry has a tremendous presence of Jews in it is no more antisemitic than pointing out that the NBA is dominated by blacks is racist.</p></li>
<li><p>Calling out the tremendous influence that Jewish interest groups (AIPAC, ADL, etc.) have on our government</p></li>
<li><p>Holocaust denial. In and of itself, denying the currently accepted version of the Holocaust is not an anti-semitic act. Claiming that certain parts of history may have been exaggerated to further political causes is not a hateful claim. Otherwise, every 9/11 conspiracy supporter would be anti-American by definition.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Antisemitism (also spelled anti-Semitism[1] or anti-semitism) is prejudice, hatred of, or discrimination against Jews as a national, ethnic, religious or racial group.&quot; - Wikipedia</p>

<p>You can hold all of the views above (and many more) without actually hating Jews as an ethnoreligious group. Furthermore, some Jews can be very antisemitic as well, such as some of the Israeli protestors who don&#39;t want black Ethiopian/Somalian Jews to share their ranks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a black and white issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmfao.  Well seriously dude, if this sub is so very bad, why are you here to complain about it?</p>

<p>Schrödinger would be very disappointed.</p>

<p>Schrödinger&#39;s conspiracy sub:  If this place was really such a shit show, would there even be anyone here to complain?  I don&#39;t think there would be, but there are people here to complain. So we have a paradox (although not really) because of your complaints.  </p>

<p>Either your complaints are valid, and there is nobody here.  Or your complaints are not valid, and there are a quarter million subscribers with 500-1000 people online at any given point in time.</p>

<p>I think it is obvious that people are here because we offer a unique experience that isn&#39;t limited by people like you.  So if given a choice between a shit show or no show at all, these people have chosen the shit show.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to chose no show at all.</p>

<p>If he won&#39;t debate on the radio, I&#39;m done with him. People can see through his indefensible nonsense. Even he can, which is why he is dodging a moderated radio debate.</p>

<p>Failing a response from Eric Hunt, I would just want you to ask Mr Cole to please respond to the various specific criticisms of his position on the Reinhardt Camps here:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think that any of these people have heard of &quot;The Bromberg Massacre&quot;--which pretty much forced Hitler&#39;s hand with the Polish Jews? When the Jewish partisans hear Hitler&#39;s army was coming through to rescue these Germans they killed 6,000 Germans wholesale. On one day. Cut babies out of wombs, raped and then blew out the women&#39;s brains, and killed every male between infancy and adulthood.</p>

<p>No trial.</p>

<p>No ceremony.</p>

<p>Just shot in the backs of the head to fall into mass graves.</p>

<p><em>They were killing ethnic Germans for no reason.</em> Hitler tried diplomacy MANY times...in the end an invasion was the only thing left to do to save his people.</p>

<p>Sorry people. Truth strikes again.</p>

<p>So, yeaaaah, I think what <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> put up was quite significant...and the movie even more enlightening.</p>

<p>Just because we&#39;re Jewish doesn&#39;t mean SOME JEWS collect &quot;sins&quot; like boys collect baseball cards. It sure seems that way though. Shame.</p>
