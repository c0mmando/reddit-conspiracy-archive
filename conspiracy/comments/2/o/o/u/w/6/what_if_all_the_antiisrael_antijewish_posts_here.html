       My speculation: we're being made to look bad.  We're getting some kind of COINTELPRO treatment.

      <p>
       In the last six months or so I've seen a ton more garden-variety anti-Jewish posts around here.  What's going on?  Sloppy moderation and bad voting?
      </p>

       A lot are.  It is worth mentioning though, that several white supremacist sites posted openly about how easy it would be to game reddit and this sub in particular.  I've taken to reporting violations of rule #1 (Jews are parasites, psychopaths, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       What gets to me is that anything Israel does that can be put in a bad light (and there's plenty) gets posted here even if it has nothing to do with a conspiracy.  FYI: if Israel announces that it is going to do something or does something with no attempt to hide it, it doesn't belong here.  "Israel announces plans for new settlements in the West Bank" is in no way a conspiracy.

       has that stuff now, which hopefully means this subreddit can return to being more of an open forum for discussion rather than an alternative news source, which does stifle the discourse a little bit because we have to play serious all the time.

       Racist: A person who generalizes an entire group of people and agitates the discourse by using vitriolic language.

      <p>
       To imply Jews have given 'nothing in return' is just ludicrous, how many famous Jewish names are there in literature, science, philosophy, and art throughout known history? They're a diverse and amazing people really.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes a particularly powerful cabal of Jews do run Hollywood and finance to our detriment. They run an Apartheid state in Israel. Zionism is trash. And so on.

       Reality thrives on generalizations. There is nothing wrong with generalizing accurately.

       If you replace "famous" with "subversive" in your comment about Jews we can agree.

       "garden variety hate" like "jews own the media (in the usa)"? its simple truth, nothing racist about it, its just a fact.

      <p>
       there are plenty of reasons to question the holocaust, as anyone who has spent the time investigating it knows. again, not racism, fact.

       i have already established that what you call "hate" is actually legitimate information and fact. albeit facts many jews would prefer remain unknown by the goyim.

      <p>
       anyone who investigates 911 finds jewish/zionist prints all over it, no racism required, that is just where the evidence trail leads. it could have led to vikings or rastafarians.... it did not.

       I think a lot of people substitute "Jewish" for "Zionist". My issue with Israel has nothing to do with Judaism the religion, it has a lot to do with the political and economic policies of Israel's leaders/Zionists (many Zionists are Jewish, though not exclusively...like VP Biden said, "you don't have to be Jewish to be a Zionist") and the control that they have over the money system of the western world.  Israel tries to hide behind religion when their policies are criticized, that needs to end. There are hate filled people out there, but the vast majority of posts I've seen on here have been legitimate in the concerns they raise about Israel's actions over the last 60 years.

       Judaism is the toxic religion that created Zionism. Zionism is just an extension of Judaic philosophy.

       People don't look past the fronts put on by TPTB. The wear religion as a mask. The "Jews" are being set up, on purpose, just like battle lines are being drawn nation against nation. It's all a show.

       They wear whatever mask and preach whatever doctrine suits the agenda as a whole, turning flesh against flesh in a twisted game of Hegelian chess involving the whole world. They're sitting at the top laughing as they look down upon us.

       Ancient Egypt was the epitome of unrighteousness. The Bible uses Egypt over and over again as a symbol for this. Yet, we see today, things from Ancient Egyptian culture in the Catholic church and Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Vatican and the Jesuit orders control everything. The fraternal orders based on Jesuit doctrine and rituals take on roles to further the goal of the society as a whole. Look at the secular universities. Look at Russel Brand, George Bush, Obama, Putin, Ahmadinejad, Netanyahu... Look at Europe. Look at the CFR, look at the central banks, the Rothschilds, the Morgans... Stalin and Churchill were on the same team, ffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may act the part to death, but the truth of the matter is they take whatever disguise furthers the cause and play that role. It's just a big show to distract us, control our focus, and make us believe we're on a ball flying through space and none of this matters. It's a joke. Their number one goal is convincing people that Jesus Christ was not God... and then they call themselves the Society of Jesus spreading a load of self-righteous bullshit into peoples minds through literature and brainwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want you to think it's the Jews so you stop thinking and start hating. That's all part of the plan.

       Well said my friend, I agree with pretty much everything here except for, "Ancient Egypt was the epitome of unrighteousness."
      </p>
      <p>
       I've come to find that Egypt (more accurately KMT) went through a relatively long period of prosperity where much of the citizenry was well-educated and spiritually advanced.  It's also the foundation on which the three Abrahamic religions are ultimately based.  Check out a book called
       <em>
        The Lost Light
       </em>
       by Alvin Boyd Kuhn if and when you ever feel inclined, it makes the argument far, far better than I ever could.

       Egypt was educated by man's standards and had quite advanced technology, I'll give you that. Spiritually, they were very deceived. Their doctrines reflect nothing of the Bible. God condemns sun god worship, which is the very thing they practiced. Much of their culture has been passed down and infiltrated into modern Christianity through paganism and mystery bablyonian religion, I'll give you that... but Biblically, they are two totally different worlds.

       Spiritually they were enlightened. The Bible and the Jewish faiths (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) all worship an evil deity who hates true spirituality and human's having knowledge named Yahweh.

       I disagree.  All three of the Abrahamic religions are ultimately based on astrology and the Zodiac which come from KMT.  The Bible was deliberately written in code and metaphor, with multiple levels of meaning, so as to disguise these origins from all but those who "have eyes".  The "elite" love and highly respect Ancient Egyptian spirituality - they consider astrology the master science.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are my opinions based mostly on that book I mentioned earlier and also on the work of Gerald Massey.

       I do agree with you about modern Christianity being thoroughly infiltrated, the RCC is one of the most corrupt corporations on Earth.

       You've been seriously deceived about the Bible. It has nothing to do with Astrology. Have you even read one?

       I will say, there is code in the Bible... but it reveals not what you think it reveals. That's why they spread lies about the Bible and lead people away from even studying it. If you knew... your eyes would be opened.

       I don't know what to say here besides I completely disagree - astrology is encoded

       Yes I have.  And I've read a lot about it.  The books and authors I mentioned before don't in any way try to lead people away from studying it, in fact they encourage people to study it - they just are trying to put it in the proper context.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible didn't emerge from nowhere, those weren't new ideas.

       I'm not trying to argue with you here as I think we agree on more things than not - I would urge you, if you're interested, to actually check out
       <em>
        The Lost Light

       .  I know that you'd find it interesting, even if you didn't necessarily agree with everything in it.  There are free .pdf's online I believe.  Otherwise, carry on my friend - we'll agree to disagree here.

       Also with regards to Christ from the Bible, here are a few other things I've discovered:
      </p>
      <p>
       He couldn't have been from "Nazareth" - the city didn't exist at the alleged time, this is clear because Romans were pretty good about keeping track of their occupied territories.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was "born in a stable" because the winter solstice lies between Sagittarius (a horse) and Capricorn (a goat).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Born of a virgin" because during the winter solstice, Virgo rises in the east - so the
       <em>
        Sun
       </em>
       is born in Virgo.
      </p>

       Jesus wasn't born in a stable or in Nazareth. He was born in Bethlehem and they stayed in a stable because there was no room at the inn. He was not born during the winter solstice either, but rather born at a time when shepherds were watching their flock in the fields (so likely the fall). He was born of a virgin because His father was God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you've been deceived and in this case lied to.

       You're missing the point.  There was no Nazareth at that time, it literally did not exist.  So any mention of it in the Bible has to be symbolic in nature as the place itself didn't exist yet in reality.
      </p>

       I don't have an interest in arguing all of this with you anymore though.  It's clear that your mind is already made up on the subject.

       I don't know what you mean.  How can Jesus be "Jesus of Nazareth" if Nazareth didn't exist during that time period?

       And you say he wasn't born in a stable - fine.  He was placed in a manger though, was he not?  And where are mangers located?  And what are they used for?  In stables, and to feed horses and goats.

       No it didn't, check the Romans' records.  They kept detailed records of their territories during that time period and Nazareth wasn't among them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if I remember correctly, the term "Nazareth" never even appeared until the NT was translated to English.

       Just because there isn't much archaeological evidence for a tiny village doesn't mean it never existed. The Roman's have every motive in the books for erasing anything they can about Jesus' history, even the Bible says that.

       Fair enough.  I don't think we're gonna come to an agreement on this my friend, let's break it off here.  If you ever are interested in where I'm coming from (and others who I'm sure you've heard make similar claims) I would recommend that book highly.  It is incredibly thorough, dense, well-written and well-researched, in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at who was involved in translating the Bible into the various different languages and considering what was or wasn't lost/added in those translations, as well as in the various "councils" over the years, are I think important considerations as well (i.e. the Piso family).

       Hmm I guess Noah's Ark is a good example because the story is well-known.  Bear in mind that I'm not an expert in theology or astrology but here is my short layman's interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, important to note that the original OT was written in Hebrew (mystery language taken from Egypt), then translated into Greek, then into Latin, then into German, then into English - so we need to be careful with our interpretation of anything other than the original Hebrew.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in Greek "arche" means beginning, in Latin "arca" means large box or chest, and then the English definition that we all know.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Hebrew, "no-ah" means rest or peace aka shalom.  So here, then, we have a state of peace "No-ah" being commanded to build an enclosure to protect something/a structure that supports something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancer is a water element (representing emotions), it's also cardinal (signaling an impulsive beginning - remember the greek definition of arche), and as the 4th house it stands for home, rest, family, safety, shelter etc. (note the etymology of "Noah").
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Ark starts in Cancer and you'll note that, right next to cancer, are Ursa Minor &amp; Major (2 bears), Canis Minor &amp; Major (2 dogs), Leo Minor &amp; Leo (2 Lions), the two stars within the Cancer constellation itself (Asellus Australis &amp; Asellus Borealis - the 2 donkeys), and the two twins of Gemini (2 humans).  These are represented in the story by the pairs of unclean animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noah builds the Ark (which is essentially the zodiac, the story is about the voyage of a sol spark, a fractal of divine unity) and also needs to provide all food needed for the animals.  Note the theme of Cancer which is nurturing and providing shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ark begins its voyage and Noah sends a Raven to seek land - this is Corvus, the 3rd decan of Leo.  The raven finds no dry land because Virgo comes after Leo which signifies mutable (disappearing) Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on Noah builds an alter which represents Ara ("The Altar"), middle decan of Scorpio.  Scorpio is a fixed water sign which is why this point in the story is the "high point" of the flood.  After Scorpio, the flood recedes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noah later sends out a dove - this is Columba, located between Taurus and Gemini.  Taurus is fixed Earth, so in this part of the story the "flood" is over and they're free to return to land.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot more to this that I'm missing and I may not have all of the details perfectly correct but that's some of the basic gist.  I'll also point out again that Alvin Boyd Kuhn makes this argument
       <em>
        far more convincingly
       </em>
       than I ever could.

       You do know that there are something like 500 flood legends around the world yeah? Not all of them have as much detail as Noah's, but they all get the story straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a vast wealth of evidence for a global flood having occurred. We can trace mankind genetically back to the Mountains of Ararat. It's a true story, not an allegory. All life, save plant and marine life, descends from the Ark in a literal sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGgSNDPhO0">

        written information
       </a>
       in case you like that better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I believe you've been deceived. The story of Noah makes sense literally and is strongly supported by science and history.

       I agree, there almost definitely was a deluge at some point in Earth's history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read
       <em>
        Fingerprints of the Gods
       </em>
       and a few other things on the subject and found them highly compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't agree with is reading the Bible at a literal, surface level.  I think that it's allegorical in nature, even if it contains some historical elements.  And I don't think a flood having occurred at some point in Earth's history and wiping out a large percentage of the world's population is proof of the accuracy of the Noah story.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said it yourself - there are hundreds upon hundreds of flood myths.  Are all of them literally true?  Even if their basis is on a flood that happened (and the Noah story may well be/probably was one of these), does that mean that the entire story is to be read on a literal level?  Isn't it possible that symbolism and allegory could have been added?

       I believe rather the information has been passed down since it happened and that the Bible is a historical, accurate retelling of our history. The evidence is there and the prophecy about our time is spot on.

       I agree that the prophecy is spot on but I would argue that this is mainly because:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        It's based largely on astrology and the movement/interaction of the constellations which have an actual effect on Earth and the way people live and act.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       and 2.  This world is largely controlled by people who are initiated into the mysteries, who use religions as tools of control, and who deliberately do as much as they can to bring the prophecies to fruition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the Bible is a literally historical document and I don't think it was ever meant to be.

       This is exactly why I didn't want to respond in the first place.  As I've said

       But to be honest, you seem to already have your mind completely made up.  And that's fine, you're of course free to think what you want, but this discussion really just feels like it's been a massive waste of time to me.

       Think about what you're dong here. You're spewing hatred out of your fingers for what? Why do you care then? Are you afraid of the truth or are you trying to deceive others? Have you ever read a Bible from cover to cover? It's quite obvious to me that either one, you're ignorant about the Bible. Two, you're lying to deceive others. Three, you've been lied to yourself. Most likely it's a combination of these three things.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to think critically about what you're doing because you may discover one day that you were wrong. You should take a good hard look at the material you're flagrantly hating on, study it, and understand it from the eyes of a Christian on that same level before you even reject something, let alone attempt to convince others against it. Furthermore, you would have a lot more ammunition if you understood your assumed enemy than hate fueled assumptions based on speculations, which is all I see coming out of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite silly to parade around like a self-righteous twat even if you're right. Educate yourself like a man and build your argument logically in context. Don't ever listen to other people speak and parrot their wisdom, for the wisdom of men is foolishness. Following people is for lost sheep.

       It's not up to me to prove you wrong. It's up to you to study and come to an unbiased conclusion. God is
       <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/who-is-god/god-is-good/the-harsh-god-of-the-old-testament/">
        just in his judgments
       </a>
       and gives every opportunity for salvation. He knows each and every one of us inside and out and can see the end from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may look like we have the easy way out, but just look at how difficult it is for people to accept the truth about Jesus Christ today. I had already made up my mind religion was outdated and stupid a long time ago, only to realize just how wrong I was.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see the truth if you want, or you can come up with every reason to reject it. You won't see the truth until you want absolute truth and don't trust
       <em>
        any

       I was indoctrinated against religion and against the Bible. I used my critical thinking skills and researching skills to seek the ultimate truth for myself and draw my own conclusions about the world. That's why I testify of Jesus Christ.

       This. The people in power/media/money which are mostly jewish hide behind that. If you try to attack them as jewish you are an antisemetic holocaust denier nazi. If you attack them as white you are also incriminating a lot of people that have no influence on them and its becoming more and more socially acceptable to bash white men for being privileged. They would prefer to be attacked as whites because then they can shift the blame on the lower level bankers that don't make executive decisions or print as much money as they want and trade it for their own benefit.
      </p>

       The discrediting posts are the ones that are pure speculation and completely absurd. And they don't need to do that anymore since everyone has already been convinced everything we say has no evidence and is stupid.

       frequently belong IMO because the neocons go along with the zionists in Israel and ruin our foreign policy. However, the "white evolution" bullshit does

       I'll agree completely but I think it's gotten the community so fucked up that the average person doesn't even want to comment anymore. A few times I've had a comment to make but don't because I don't feel like being called a shill or agent provocateur. I'm just an average guy with no agenda but I fear voicing my opinion. I think that ultimately "their" goal. Shut up moderates and let the extremist own the conversation.

       I believe you're correct. Also, there's
       <a href="/u/cronycapitalism">

       who primarily posts anti jewish and anti alex jones pieces interspersed among some other more relevant postings. No idea why someone would be so dedicated to that if they didn't have an agenda of some sort.

       HamBaconEggs was a nice psyop designed to discredit everyone who criticizes Zionism, Jewry, and Israel. How is this not obvious?
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of people who criticize Israel here seem quite genuine. There's been one or two posters posting links to hubski.com that are probably shills. The rest, I highly doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread is just another attempt to try to get the mods to ban users who out Israel.

       That's not what he's pointing at and you know it. Instead of being witty for your own self-righteousness, why not come down off your high horse and contribute something meaningful and insightful. Your mockery, hatefulness, and parroting is getting pretty old. Your veil has worn very thin, while your bigotry knows no limits.

      <p>
       Besides, after the stuff about radioactive dust in St. Louis came out, suddenly, the chemtrails crew doesn't seem that off any more.

       That's not what he's pointing at and you know it. Instead of being witty for your own self-righteousness, why not come down off your high horse and contribute something meaningful and insightful. Your mockery, hatefulness, and parroting is getting pretty old. Your veil has worn very thin, while your bigotry knows no limits.

       Hmm I guess Noah's Ark is a good example because the story is well-known.  Bear in mind that I'm not an expert in theology or astrology but here is my short layman's interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, important to note that the original OT was written in Hebrew (mystery language taken from Egypt), then translated into Greek, then into Latin, then into German, then into English - so we need to be careful with our interpretation of anything other than the original Hebrew.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in Greek "arche" means beginning, in Latin "arca" means large box or chest, and then the English definition that we all know.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Hebrew, "no-ah" means rest or peace aka shalom.  So here, then, we have a state of peace "No-ah" being commanded to build an enclosure to protect something/a structure that supports something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancer is a water element (representing emotions), it's also cardinal (signaling an impulsive beginning - remember the greek definition of arche), and as the 4th house it stands for home, rest, family, safety, shelter etc. (note the etymology of "Noah").
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Ark starts in Cancer and you'll note that, right next to cancer, are Ursa Minor &amp; Major (2 bears), Canis Minor &amp; Major (2 dogs), Leo Minor &amp; Leo (2 Lions), the two stars within the Cancer constellation itself (Asellus Australis &amp; Asellus Borealis - the 2 donkeys), and the two twins of Gemini (2 humans).  These are represented in the story by the pairs of unclean animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noah builds the Ark (which is essentially the zodiac, the story is about the voyage of a sol spark, a fractal of divine unity) and also needs to provide all food needed for the animals.  Note the theme of Cancer which is nurturing and providing shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ark begins its voyage and Noah sends a Raven to seek land - this is Corvus, the 3rd decan of Leo.  The raven finds no dry land because Virgo comes after Leo which signifies mutable (disappearing) Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on Noah builds an alter which represents Ara ("The Altar"), middle decan of Scorpio.  Scorpio is a fixed water sign which is why this point in the story is the "high point" of the flood.  After Scorpio, the flood recedes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noah later sends out a dove - this is Columba, located between Taurus and Gemini.  Taurus is fixed Earth, so in this part of the story the "flood" is over and they're free to return to land.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot more to this that I'm missing and I may not have all of the details perfectly correct but that's some of the basic gist.  I'll also point out again that Alvin Boyd Kuhn makes this argument
       <em>
        far more convincingly
       </em>
       than I ever could.

       Also with regards to Christ from the Bible, here are a few other things I've discovered:
      </p>
      <p>
       He couldn't have been from "Nazareth" - the city didn't exist at the alleged time, this is clear because Romans were pretty good about keeping track of their occupied territories.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was "born in a stable" because the winter solstice lies between Sagittarius (a horse) and Capricorn (a goat).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Born of a virgin" because during the winter solstice, Virgo rises in the east - so the
       <em>
        Sun
       </em>
       is born in Virgo.
