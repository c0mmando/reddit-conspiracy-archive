<p>I noticed it was removed right after I submitted it, without the help of <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a>, since they don&#39;t notify you in any way that your post was removed. So I sent them a kind message &quot;was this removed.&quot; <em>2 hours later,</em> they say yes and I explain that I will delete the submission and resubmit so that it isn&#39;t buried. </p>

<p>Their response? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Keep it up. We don&#39;t like playing games with the idea of &quot;Well, if it&#39;s buried, let me repost it by &quot;deleting-resubmitting&quot; so that it&#39;s seen again.&quot; Too easy to abuse so we don&#39;t allow it. Thus, we follow the policy of you only get one bite at the apple. Sorry the automod got you, but, little we can do about that. It gets everyone.</p>

<p>In other words, he&#39;s either too lazy to click &quot;approve&quot; again, or has a list of disallowed topics for Reddit approval. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only does exercise alleviate depression but it appears to modulate the effects of SSRIs.</p>

<p>One of the current postulated mechanisms by which SSRIs are meant to work over the long term is by upregulating neurogenesis (creation of new neurons and glia) in the hippocampus. In animal models where hippocampal neurogenesis has been blocked, SSRIs appear less effective (just how &quot;effective&quot; SSRIs are is seriously coming into question as more metanalyses are performed).</p>

<p>So what factors modulate hippocampal neurogenesis? A LOT.</p>

<p>(Things that increase it: exercise, good nutrition, adequate sleep and other stuff. Things that decrease it: immunologic overactivity, STRESS, poor nutrition, and other stuff).</p>

<p>One of the most important factors for increasing neuronal hippocampus is exercise. A good cardio session is one of the best things you can do for your brain, it increases blood flow throughout your cranial vasculature, so nutrients, waste products and also positive trophic factors can be circulated through better. Exercise really does wonders for your physiology, it improves the function of almost every aspect of how your body maintains homeostasis. It also is one of the best things you can do to reduce stress, and chronic stress shrinkz ya cortex and literally will kill you eventually).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re on SSRIs then make sure to exercise!</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not on SSRIs then make sure to exercise!</p>

<p>Another good practice is mindfulness. From what research has been done so far on mindfulness meditation and mindfulness practices in general, they appear to have very beneficial effects on the brain and body.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t exercise or you are unfit... now is the time to start. <a href="http://www.c25k.com/">http://www.c25k.com/</a> is a good program - begins from a very minimal workout (for couch potatoes) to running 5 KM.</p>

<p>You&#39;re correct, it&#39;s not evidence, although this is a r/conspiracy and people tend to theories as to why a mod would act in this manner.  I don&#39;t believe the mod is on the payroll of SSRI manufacture, but I do tend to think there is something going on with the mods as gatekeepers and I have personally seen specific information restricted by using these kind of tactics.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Studies &quot;prove&quot; nothing. That is not how research works. I agree there is some research that seems to just re-inforce what &#39;should be&#39; &#39;common sense&#39;, but eh, people will put out whatever it takes to get published, that&#39;s just the climate particularly in North America.</p>

<p>Further providing evidence of these systemic, gross-level effects of exercise compounds a body of evidence which is then built on by further research that actually attempts to figure out the mechanisms. Exercise physiology goes way deeper than just &#39;exercise is gud 4 u&#39; but a news outlet is not going to report on a study and present it accurately if it&#39;s like &#39;changes in respiratory capacity of mitochondria in Type IIa fibres&#39; or &#39;metabolic consequences of reactive oxygen species production after isometric eccentric contractions&#39;</p>

<p>Also keep in mind ur perception of the research is coming through a filter of a journalist who is likely scientifically illiterate, and their info probably came from the institution&#39;s media/PR staff who are also scientifically illiterate. Science &quot;journalism&quot; is fucking dismal in most outlets. </p>

<p>No, Obesity is one condition which contributes to depression, let&#39;s be semantically correct here. I know obese people who are not depressed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of depressed people.</p>

<p>Do they live under rocks? I don&#39;t understand how any American born citizen older than 12 does not know the benefits of regular exercise, it&#39;s taught and enforced since first grade, it&#39;s inexcusable to say &quot;well I didn&#39;t know&quot; because people are almost screaming it at the top of their lungs to these kids.</p>

<p>No, they do this because they&#39;re lazy and want a quick fix which requires no actual work on their part.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot easier to pop a pill than to get on the ground and fire off 20 push ups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to offer my side of the obesity/depression/SSRI... I was thin and depressed, my depression lead to emotional eating, which then led to me gaining weight. I&#39;m on an SSRI now and I exercise 6 days a week and eat very healthy. I don&#39;t take the SSRI as a quick fix. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried natural remedies and it did not fix my depression. I know everyone is different and for me exercise did not cure my depression. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah. Probably got snagged by the bot because of how old the paper is that the story was based on. But I think your story added more information, which is why it was approved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just going to clear up a misconception here, and then be done with the conversation. No one &#39;waited two hours&#39; to approve your submission with malicious intent. Sometimes we miss things, and there is a relatively small number of moderators. Your post was also very late, when most of our team is asleep. We are certainly not going to hold ourselves to a &#39;2 minute&#39; turnaround time as you mention in one of your posts.</p>

<p>The submission got missed, I apologize for that. However, it wasn&#39;t intentional and it is how the Reddit system works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did explain in the mod mail that I would invent a conspiracy theory about mods suppressing this important scientific information since you guys didn&#39;t agree with a delete/repost to make my submission fair. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just having fun here. To be honest, when I read that study, I knew that somehow it wouldn&#39;t be allowed to be seen on Reddit, which appears to have a massive boner for pharmaceutical corporations, which is why I checked if it had been removed in the first place. Must be just a coincidence.</p>
