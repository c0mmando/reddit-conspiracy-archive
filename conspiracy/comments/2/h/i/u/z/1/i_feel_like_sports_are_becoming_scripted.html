       I wasn't sure where to post this, so I thought this sub would be appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like modern national (at least American) sports are becoming scripted, almost a new form of reality television. It seems like the "human interest" part of sports are becoming more important than the sports themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying this now because of last night's Derek Jeter walk-off game winning single during his last at bat at Yankee Stadium. Over the last month or so he has been on the receiving end of one of the most gaudy, over the top send-offs in sports history. Every stadium he visits gives him a gift, and the Yankees have even put patches on their caps to signify his retirement (usually reserved for when someone of importance dies). In his last at bat, he gets a first pitch meatball down the middle, and hits a single to win the game. It just seems way too good to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another one related to the Yankees was their home game on September 11, 2002, when the 7th inning stretch was at exactly 9:11 pm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another one that instantly jumps to my mind is the Boston Red Sox winning the World Series last year, the same year as the Boston Marathon bombing. They finished dead last in their division in 2012, and finished the same dead last this year, but last year they just happened to win the World Series.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I'm not going crazy, and I realize the huge intricacies that would need to take place for major sporting events to be fixed, but I just can't shake the feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone else think this is true, or have any other "too good to be true" sports stories?

       The Super Bowl was in February. So it was either before 9/11 or in 2002. I don't care about sports so I don't know which year they won.

       I absolutely agree. The walk-off was pre-planned and staged to make sure it went off without a hitch. Would shatter their fairytale if he, say, struck out the last time he played Yankee Stadium.

       To me professional wrestling demonstrates precisely why all "real" sporting events are scripted. Professional wrestling was not always fixed. It originated as a real contest. Promoters eventually realised there was more money to be made in an entertainment based business model, and the "sport" slowly transitioned into the spectacle it has become today.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another note, if WWE admits that it is scripted entertainment, then it is not "fake" as many "true sports fans" assert. Ironically, the sports leagues that claim legitimacy and then fix/tilt their games are far more fake than the WWE who openly acknowledge that the contests are not legitimate.

       Just for the sake of defending it.. WWE is self-proclaimed sports ENTERTAINMENT.
Which means they openly admit to it being "Fake".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that fake.. maybe punches, kicks, head buts, etc., and storyline..
      </p>
      <p>
       These men are very skilled and tremendous REAL athletes, not some dumb hillbillies hollerin at eachother. Everything they do, and everybody out in the ring (wrestlers, referee, commentators, crew, etc..)  they all work together in perfect sync to get things done the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may fake injuries for storyline more often than not, but getting hit in the head with chairs, falling through tables (compressed sawdust), smacking that ringmat, hitting nothing but a rubber mat on concrete, jumping off structure, even sometimes submissions! All that is real and sometimes will seriously injure them if not performed correctly. In the NFL, you can get seriously injured if you don't perform your tackles and brace for hits correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       People discredit WWE too much, put Adrian Peterson in the ring with Triple H and AP might look like the clueless hillbilly.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, look up Mayweather punches Big Show. Oh man does big show get a pretty crispy four piece to the face!
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes they try to include real life feuds into a kayfabe storyline, mostly relationships and shit..but at least that's a real story lol.
CM Punks outing and story was real too.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can get a pretty good kick out of watching the Attitude Era, I'd say from '97 to '02 was just about the best they will ever get. It was okay up until CM Punk quit last year, now the storylines.. efforts of authentic emotions.. it's all just bullshit right now. Some of the shit they've been showing lately is just hard to watch.

       FYI, the NFL classifies itself as "entertainment" the same as the WWE.  When the Patriots were caught stealing signals vs. the Jets, a fan sued to get a refund on his ticket because the game was fixed, but the court ruled that his ticket entitled him to a seat in the stadium to be entertained; didn't  matter if it was rigged or corrupt.

       So maybe the nfl isn't necessarily scripted, but fixed and swayed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we not forget Peyton Mannings superb owl performance? I mean come on, after a year like that, with a man like that, you should be able to get the job done or at least put up one hell of a fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the Seahawks in the superb owl, and the Red Sox in the World Series.. came up in a short year and currently pose no threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine how much money people made off those two games..

       Oh the NFL is definitely fixed. I have a friend whose a huge football fan, well, was I guess? He still follows his favorite team, but even he admits to it being planned to some degree. It's all about who has the money- they want to look good, and they want their "brand" to sell.

       I like the
       <em>
        idea
       </em>
       of capitalism and competing markets breeding innovation...but the USA is in no way a capitalist society anymore. That is, of course, unless we define capitalist by "people who capitalize on every person and situation," then we are definitely a capitalist society.

       But different kinds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nfl says they're real and make money off of players who think it's real too, if people/players thought it was fixed things would change.
      </p>
      <p>
       WWE says they're scripted and makes money off the superstars who are in it to entertain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, the nfl is definitely entertainment, but that's not the same as Sports Entertainment.

       Other interesting instances have occurred too.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the NHL:
      </p>
      <p>
       Detroit failing as a city but the Red Wings flourish.
The Leafs are the highest grossing team. In fact only three teams make money in the NHL, the Leafs, Canadiens, and Rangers. The other teams are simply there to play them so people have something to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the same reason those teams no longer need to win. And don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pittsburgh Penguins selling the team? Turmoil and the franchise might not exist? Give them a cup go Crosby?
      </p>
      <p>
       You think the Red Sox the only team to win cause of the Marathon? What about the Bruins?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the fact that Garry Bettman, the commissioner of the NHL was fired from the NBA in a match rigging scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the fact Wayne Gretzky's wife landed him in a pile of trouble for betting on games.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes on and on and on.

      <p>
       Oh, you still don't believe world events are scripted? Well what if you found out that the sports you've been watching all your life, and growing up around are also rigged and set up for entertainment?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean watching the last 30 minuets of any sport is like watching the season finale of Law &amp; Order: SVU.. so much tension.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's crazy how they can turn 60 minuets of game time into 3 hours of drama

       The Flyers make money and here's why... The Flyers won 2 Stanley cups within 7 or so years of existence. Now I'm not staying that was rigged. But the league figured out that if you give an expansion team a cup... The fanbase will solidify for years to come. Since then several expansion teams won fairly quickly in their existence.

       Sports are scripted.  The NFL, which defines itself as "entertainment" and not a sport, has a colored history of game-fixing and corruption.  Other leagues do as well.

       One quote from the article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a 2004 lawsuit vs the NFL, the NFL attorney Gregg H. Levy argued that "the NFL is not a collection of 32 individual teams, but rather a single entity. And as long as the NFL teams are a unit, and they compete as a unit in the entertainment marketplace, then they should be deemed a single unit and not subject to any Anti-Trust laws."
       </p>

       These claims are based off absolutely nothing. There are plenty of instances of fixing in sports, but to suggest that this was scripted you're going to need a little more than it's "too good to be true." Otherwise you fall into the category of irrational conspiracy nut who believes everything is a conspiracy. And that makes us look bad.

       But I get it, these things are fun to ponder about. It was interesting how Michael Kay called the play. "Derek Jeter! Where fantasy becomes reality! Did you have any doubt!?"

       After the bombing the 2013 Red Sox played around 150 regular season games plus 16 more in the post-season. You'd be asking hundreds of players to rig that every day for over six months.

       During Jeter's final at-bat he did receive a gift from the Orioles, who risked injury or fatigue by going into an extra inning game they didn't really need to win since clinching that division.

       So much money is shifted to an area when play off games are played there that they are probably manipulated. If the play off games were to go to an already wealthy city a couple times in a row it would cause localized inflation.. Just a thought I had. I just think it is to much money to not be manipulated.

       The 1989 San Fran earthquake rocks Candlestick during the MLB World Series. In this case, the Giants lost to Oakland @ Candlestick the last two games (right after the quake) that year. Still, though. You had TWO teams from the bay area in the Championship Series? ... and one huge earthquake.

       I've wouldn't say they are direct fixed outcomes but their is definitely a bias and favoritism shown by sports leagues/promotors.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will often see it in the handling of promoting, the one sided calls from refs, the judgements on instant replays, the often different interpretations of the rules for different teams athletes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't watch a lot of team sports but I enjoy a lot of combat sports, boxing,kick boxing mma etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can spot all sorts of bias on the side of the promoters and can almost feel who they want to win as it will lead to a more profitable fight to promote.
      </p>
      <p>
       That bring said I don't feel the outcomes are 100% determined but the leagues/promoters will utilize any area that they can to influence and make it favorable for the team/athlete they want to win.

       The 2013 Superbowl was completely scripted after a the blackout. They had the blackout because the ravens were destroying the 49's at half time. Everyone was no longer interested in the game so they planned a blackout and had the 49's go on a comeback streak to make the game interesting again. The whole entire game after the blackout was rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is all about the advertisements and too many people were turning off there TV's. The advertisement companies were paying so much money for the air time. I'm sure they were very unhappy about the game so the NFL had to make the game interesting again so people would tune back in.

       Sports is fixed, not by the players but the officials.  It's easier to control a small group of people such as the officials than it is the players.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most players go into a game wanting to win and it would be too difficult for the conspirators to keep the players from talking so it would be inevitable that fixing games would be exposed.  The conspirators found this out early on with the 1919 Black Sox scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The officials on the other hand are usually older gentlemen who usually have a family who want to provide for them and want to live a nice healthy life.  The officials are a small group of older men who get paid quite well to attend games and travel around the country.  These would be the perfect individuals to corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many times have we watched a professional sporting event whether it's Baseball, Football, Basketball or whatever and seen the most bullshit calls from the official that sway the game towards a particular team.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NFL even has instant replay and every once in a while after a coach's challenge where the official reviews a play, the official will emerge from under the Instant Replay Hood and make a bullshit call that will have everyone in the stands, people at home and the commentators disagreeing with what the official says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tim Donaghy was caught a few years ago for fixing NBA games and now he's spilling the beans on the how the NBA encourages officials to call a game to go in favor of a certain team.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, sports is being scripted and they're pretty effective at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that said, I think Derek Jeter hitting that walk off single was given to him by the pitcher as it was his last game at bat.  Just like I feel that Brett Favre gave that sack to Michael Strahan to get the sack record.

       I think it is pretty clear that sports in America are primarily entertainment, with the legitimacy of the completion taking a back seat to the desire to drive audience numbers via lowest common denominator tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the problem runs as rampant in Europe though; and I think this has a lot to do with how gambling is treated in America as opposed to elsewhere in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the US, because gambling is illegal for the most part; the result of sport is not a political issue for the individual citizen and therefore there is no incentive for lawmakers to regulate legitimate outcomes beyond "cheating" (steroids, etc); whereas when gambling is legal the outcome of each sporting event becomes part of the citizens political life and organizations (such as FIFA and the PFA in England) are held to legal standards surrounding the results of sporting competitions.

       Its useless to watch sports anymore, when the experts are pretty much naming every team thats going to be in the playoffs, at the beginning of the season. You know who the winners and losers are going to be, so why invest your time or emotions? I'd love to go back to a time where there werent so many experts around, putting every single thing under a microscope. Sports are supposed to be fun... not recently though

       Yeah, because it's perfectly rational to expect that a man can put the bat on a ball to result in an in-play ball 100% of the time, if only he wants to. Most of the time these guys miss the ball or pop out, it's on purpose.

       They did that at the All-Star game, yep.

       What was the pitch last night, specifically, and what was its speed, and how does that compare to other pitches the same pitcher threw to the hitters ahead of Jeeter?

       I could say refs have a major influence but for football how could you convince 53 men to get beat and look like shit? I think sports could be scripted but it's not vary likly. Jeter making a clutch hit is just who he is. With the Red Sox, it's not like the other team was pitching underhand and not trying to win. Was jeters almost hr in the 1st scripted?

       It's as easy as pulling two or three key players aside. In football, the center, quarterback, and maybe a receiver. Recent example; Have the center hike the ball terribly, have Peyton Manning miss catching it, have a Seahawk catch an 'interception'.

       I could easily see refs blow calls for personal bets placed on teams but I look at it as both the Nose and the Center are affected by their own performance. If the C "throws the game" than that guy has put his own job up for grabs.

       Football is easy, you could just corrupt the quarterback that's all it would take.  or maybe just one of the receivers, shit, even just the kicker could throw the game.  That's what the super bowl has become two teams trying to throw the game.

       Pay them millions, maybe, and threaten to take that away via a permanently disabling injury if they don't play the game right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you don't need 106 players across two football teams to control the outcome of a game. Just the right one or two will often do the trick.

      <p>
       Not that I think that's happening wholesale (though my money would be on it happening frequently, moreso in college football than pro, driven by sports betting), but that's a way.

       Here's the hilarious thing...
      </p>
      <p>
       In pro wrestling, the results are pre-determined. It's no secret. Pro wrestling executives will tell you this. A high-ranking executive in the largest pro-wrestling company recently did exactly this, publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet for pay-per-views, Vegas oddsmakers and sportsbooks will actually take action on matches!
