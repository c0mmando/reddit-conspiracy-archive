    <div class="md"><p>Where does this information come from? </p>

<p>This has been doing the rounds on the internet for years now. I looked into it once and I traced the information back to some guys blog. He did not give any sources. </p>

<p>This time with OP&#39;s link it goes as far back as some forum. With ZERO sources. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite a bold claim to say that every single central bank in the world is owned by the Rothschild&#39;s and provide, as far as I can see, no sources for such a claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rothschild&#39;s owning the central backs is really beside the point, the point is the central banks being privately owned entities with fiat currencies that in most cases have zero oversight. They should not be private. Same goes for the IMF. </p>

<p>They&#39;re a giant scam to redistribute the ownership of real assets, tangible wealth with fiat currency they print themselves, with interest.</p>

<p>The reason behind most people believing it&#39;s all Rothschild is probably largely due to the quote: Give me control of the nations money supply and I care not who makes the laws. Though its undeniable they&#39;re involved in private banking - It really isn&#39;t feasible for them to be the only family  or cabal in the mix.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly agree with your concerns about privately owned banks, fiat currencies and the lack of transparency. </p>

<p>That is an interesting quote, I know there are sources for it. But I also believe it&#39;s open for interpretation as to what was really meant by it. And I believe the attribution of that quote is up for debate as well. </p>

<p>But yeah, If all of the worlds central banks are owned by one family, I would want to know about that, and it would be helpful to know how credible that claim really is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really a claim of validity, more a theory of the origin of belief, as it&#39;s been attributed to him irrespective of it&#39;s accuracy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost a certainty it&#39;s not one family, all rivers flow to the sea, and like you&#39;ve pointed out there should be more evidence for this claim, or evidence at all.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t even really make sense for it to be one family, the fewer families involved the more external people have to be trusted for the collusion to continue. The amount of families or groups involved would probably closely resemble the amount of large conglomerates that can operate in any given market, relative to it&#39;s size. The size of this market, Money, just happens to be quite fucking large.</p>

<p>In saying this, there&#39;s probably almost certainly a hierarchy, just like the internal structure of any company, except there&#39;d be internal family hierarchies and family to family hierarchies. This is probably based off overall assets, and the collusions would be to the bone, and would be a tradition.</p>

<p>Take for example Skull and Bones society at Yale, they are unflinchingly loyal to one another but are no related by blood - this can be observed in the nepotism the members engage in once graduated from Yale.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, it was on a farm. My identity as a young boy was that of a farmer, and I sided with farmers over &#39;town folk&#39;; extrapolate this to being a person growing up in private banking family, and owners family, you would confirm to the private banking family and against the pleb-folk.</p>

<p>This could be confirmation bias, but it&#39;s more of an argument for indoctrination in my opinion and histories proof that once power has been obtained, rarely is it released willingly. </p>

<p>Haha, sorry for the long windedness of that reply : D</p>

<p>I think we both agree private banks are bad.</p>

<p>Exactly right. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think what you said is too much of a confirmation bias. Real power is usually contained within certain families and access for outsiders is rare without significant opportunities early on in life.  </p>

<p>Those who end up in cabinet within the UK government for example usually have gone through Eton School, Oxford University and the Bullindon Club (UK&#39;s answer to the Skull and Cross Bones Society). They are bred for power and nothing else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When ive done some research on this, i came to find similar issues. One of the reasons ive found for these issues, though, is that the rothschilds own plenty of banks with different names, so it is incredibly difficult to track it all directly to them. </p>

<p>The closest ive got is confirming that these countries have control over their own banks, and dont have the centralized international type banks that the rest of the world has. Their banks are typically backed by their own assetts and not by loans and debt. </p>

<p>Plus, everytime one of our presidents tried to get rid of the fed reserve, they were assassinated. When other countries tried to refuse against adopting the international banking system, they were conveniently invaded for &quot;humanitarian&quot; reasons, afterwards setting up an international banking system within their government.</p>

<p>To me, the rothschilds (whether theyre behind it or not) are not as important as is the notion that when a country refuses to give up their national banking system backed by their own merit, they are somehow amd for some reason vilified and invaded, and then an international banking systembis installed that from then on causes them to have absurd amounts of debt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are financial historians out there who would know a damn sight more about the banking dynasties of the world than anyone in this thread.</p>

<p>There is a Scottish historian by the name Niall Ferguson who has written a book on the Rothschild family, with three editions. It is entitled, <em>The House of Rothschild: The World&#39;s Banker, 1849–1999 (1999)</em>. </p>

<p>Regardless of the fact that this particular historian is now a mainstream celebrity historian, I&#39;m sure it will have some useful information in there. After all, he has spent his entire life studying history, particularly financial history. </p>

<p>I will gladly do some research online, and as helpful as that may be, I doubt any of us would be able to come up with any conclusive answers to the question, <em>does the Rothschild family own all central banks?</em>, without visiting a well stocked library. </p>

Finally Todd, and Illuminati defector has this to say:
Todd makes clear the Rothschilds, a family of Sabbatean Jewish Cabalists, top the Illuminati hierarchy:
&quot;The Rothschilds lead the Illuminati and in every country they have a family ...being the head of the Illuminati. In the United States, we have the Rockefellers. David Rockefeller is both the head of the Council of Foreign Relations and the Trilateral [Commission] which is the name of the Illuminati within the United States.&quot;
&quot;On the top of each pyramid you will see a capstone with an eye in it. The capstone is the Rothschild Family or Tribunal that rules the Illuminati; they were the creators of it. The eye is Lucifer, their god and their voice. The first 3 top blocks are on every pyramid. The top block is what I was initiated into, the council of 13 called the Grand Druid Council. They only take orders from the Rothschilds and nobody else. They&#39;re their private priesthood. The Council of 33 is directly under them, that is the 33 highest Masons in the World. The Council of 500, some of the richest people and conglomerates in the World-[including the Bilderbergs and the families like the Duponts and Kennedys.]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Planes are such easy targets.  They&#39;re fast, moving targets, in secure space, high up away from people, they can be disguised/faked.  They can be taken down many different ways, influencing what happens to the crash/debris.  Once they go down, I heard the attorney general has to first declare it the scene of a crime or it&#39;s actually <em>illegal</em> to gather evidence.   Also, results of an NTSB investigation are inadmissible in court.  Supposedly a senator was taken out that way.  Most of the participants don&#39;t even need to be in the know.  A few conspirators in key positions can carryout a very slick cover-up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, don&#39;t quote me on this, but I&#39;m fairly sure the Assad regime is against the US military intervention against ISIS in Syria. </p>

<p>It would be relatively easy if the US was successfully attacked by ISIS, and lets say a plane was brought down, for the US Government to blame Syria, claiming that ISIS does not have the capability to bring down one of its fighter jets. </p>

<p>Or maybe the US thinks that an illegal military incursion into Syrian airspace will be enough to provoke the Syrian regime into a military response. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve defended themselves, Iraq invaded Iran.</p>

<p>&#39;The Iran–Iraq War began when Iraq invaded Iran via air and land on 22 September 1980. It followed a long history of border disputes, and was motivated by fears that the Iranian Revolution in 1979 would inspire insurgency among Iraq&#39;s long-suppressed Shia majority as well as Iraq&#39;s desire to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state. Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of Iran&#39;s revolutionary chaos and attacked without formal warning, they made only limited progress into Iran and were quickly repelled; Iran regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. For the next six years, Iran was on the offensive.[35] A number of proxy forces participated in the war, most notably the Iranian Mujahedin-e-Khalq siding with Ba&#39;athist Iraq and Iraqi Kurdish militias of Kurdish Democratic Party and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan siding with Iran—all suffering a major blow by the end of the conflict.&#39; - Wiki</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I guess I read the first comment wrong, I agree defending at the request of a state is not a pre-emptive attack. You are correct.</p>

<p>I think the US being in the picture now definitely complicates things. Not that it wasn&#39;t complicated for them to help in the first instance - not too sure how Iran would get to Syria - They&#39;re locked out by Turkey and Iraq&#39;s boarder, which both states have large operating US bases. Do not see them allowing passage.</p>

<p>There&#39;s always the air, but that doesn&#39;t really solve the problem of the people on the ground, and any large troop movement Iran attempted to fly into Syria I would assume would be met with &#39;rebel&#39; SAMs along the way.</p>

<p>Gadaffi and Saddam were prophetic in their speech to the Arab leagues, especially Saddam; You&#39;re laughing at me now, but Cheney and I were friends, tomorrow you might wake up and it could be you they come for this time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? Is it because Iran wanted to sell oil for Euros and other currencies and because Iran&#39;s central bank is still state controlled? Why is Lybia under constant attack from the West? Because they wanted to sell oil for gold dinars and had support from other Arab nations? This has a lot to do with money and how the petrodollar is being propped up artificially. When the banks of the West want something, they get it. The IMF got Ukraine out of an illegal coup supported by the West. Russia is forming new alliances in the East and making huge deals while Europe suffers from Russian sanctions. More money the West isn&#39;t being included in. And with the possibility of a new currency format in the future, Russia and the East and the middle-East are becoming a threat. The only reason world central banking is allowed to thrive is because it is being used, not because of merit. Nations are still putting their faith in it. As soon as half the world doesn&#39;t agree with Western central banking, it is finished as a world influence device. When it comes down to it, American money is backed by bullying, not oil or precious metals. The only way for the US dollar to stay afloat now is to make sure no other nation turns it&#39;s back on it and to make sure they shore up loose ends. Nationalism is a threat to this. The Western banking powers have killed nationalism in the West. Now they need to kill Arab nationalism. People who work for their communities and for their people as a race are the biggest threat to world banking and Western influence with the exception of israel for obvious reasons. Places like North Korea are tightly enclosed and not cooperating on a global level. They are targets. To have world domination, you can&#39;t have sects of independent people, you can&#39;t have borders and you need neoliberalism across the board. This is the only way to secure the future of business of money and who controls it. All these wars are a part of the same war, the war on nationalism for the security of equal opportunity debt slaves and equal opportunity corrupted political figureheads. Equality is a prominent message coming out of the West but it doesn&#39;t mean what we are told it means. But that&#39;s another conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one of the reasons. Another reason is that Assad rejected Qatar&#39;s proposal of a pipeline that ran from Qatar to Turkey via Syria. He then went on to approve a pipeline that ran from Iran and through Iraq. Coincidentally, the &#39;rebellion&#39; started not long after that.</p>

<p>Also, Ukraine hosts some of Russia&#39;s pipelines and their government was overthrown back in February, in favour of a pro-US/EU/NATO one. This was most welcome news to the US - who totally had nothing to do with the coup as they respect the sovereignty of other nations just too damn much - as they would have had a lot of control over these pipelines, with the added bonus of being able to set up NATO bases and weapon systems right on Russia&#39;s doorstep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I guess I read the first comment wrong, I agree defending at the request of a state is not a pre-emptive attack. You are correct.</p>

<p>I think the US being in the picture now definitely complicates things. Not that it wasn&#39;t complicated for them to help in the first instance - not too sure how Iran would get to Syria - They&#39;re locked out by Turkey and Iraq&#39;s boarder, which both states have large operating US bases. Do not see them allowing passage.</p>

<p>There&#39;s always the air, but that doesn&#39;t really solve the problem of the people on the ground, and any large troop movement Iran attempted to fly into Syria I would assume would be met with &#39;rebel&#39; SAMs along the way.</p>

<p>Gadaffi and Saddam were prophetic in their speech to the Arab leagues, especially Saddam; You&#39;re laughing at me now, but Cheney and I were friends, tomorrow you might wake up and it could be you they come for this time. </p>

<p>I think the window for them to do anything about it, could possible be gone. I think it&#39;s going to take a power like China, or Russia to do something to help the Syrian plight.</p>
