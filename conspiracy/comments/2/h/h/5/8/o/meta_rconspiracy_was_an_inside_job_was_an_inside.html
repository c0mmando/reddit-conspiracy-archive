        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2heen9/rconspiracy_was_an_inside_job/">Here&#39;s a link for those who haven&#39;t seen the post</a>.</p>

<p>Upon a brief examination of OP&#39;s history, it&#39;s quite clear where OP is coming from. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you have the wrong subreddit. <a href="/r/treadmill">/r/treadmill</a>-of-political-theater is that way&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t post stupid questions. OK there champ?</p>

<p>Speaking of propaganda...Shut up troll.</p>

<p>What the fuck are you on. </p>

<p>This is a conspiracy sub. Not the place where you post shit you can&#39;t post elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is actually the type of user that we frequently warn, and eventually ban upon repeat offenses. </p>

<p>It just so happens that this particular user escaped our attention.</p>

<p>Now with this in mind, let&#39;s read laborinvain&#39;s opening statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The subreddit r/conspiracy has been under attack for a long time. Disinfo flooding the gates. Discredit trolls, posting the absurdly, utterly, provably nutjob worst in order to make the whole Sub seem crazy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who constantly attack and insult users have done <em>far</em> more damage to this sub than those who submit fringe blogs about inner Earth cities and human settlements on Mars and whatnot.</p>

<p>This has become the new method of deflection and distraction from what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> <em>always</em> has been about: a place where people can freely speculate about what they wish without censorship <em>and</em> ridicule (as long as they follow the rules of the website, of course).</p>

<p>I should be clear that I&#39;m not outright accusing laborinvain (a 5-year-old account) of being an &quot;inside job,&quot; however, it&#39;s important to understand why these sentiments are being promoted...for example OP&#39;s post is currently being linked to in <a href="/r/worstof">/r/worstof</a>.</p>

<p>I did fight it strange that OP could seemingly be coming from a place of such superiority, yet OP&#39;s main contribution to the sub seems to be berating other users.</p>

<p>However, the first serious red flag was the excessive mention and praise for Steven Jones, a known fraud among veteran conspiracy researchers.</p>

<p>Jones, according to OP, is &quot;a fairly prominent physicist&quot; who &quot;had actually been instrumental in debunking the claims that cold fusion had been achieved back in the 90s&quot; (it was the late 80s, but that&#39;s just quibbling).</p>

<p>This is a very twisted portrayal of how those events actually went down.</p>

<p>For a much different perspective, I highly recommend the film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htgV7fNO-2k">Heavy Watergate</a> (perhaps a candidate for a future featured doc?).</p>

<p>Pons and Fleischmann were <em>forced</em> to make their announcement before they were ready, thus making it easier to shoddily &quot;debunk&quot; their discovery in the press and put the mere notion of cold fusion to rest in the public&#39;s consciousness.</p>

<p>They were forced to play their hand prematurely by none other than Steven Jones.</p>

<p>For those who have been paying attention, cold fusion is no longer in the realm of science fiction. There are far more variables in the realm of time and space at play here, and lately the field has been exploding. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not the 90&#39;s anymore. Pons and Fleischmann have long been vindicated, though the press and general public are a few decades behind the times.</p>

<p><a href="http://newenergytimes.com/v2/sr/StevenEJones/JonesVote.shtml">Jones was trying to pirate and then discredit their discovery.</a></p>

<p>Fast forward to the events of 9/11. Incredibly, Steven Jones reemerges as the champion of the &quot;Truth&quot; movement with the thermite red herring. </p>

<p>OP then surprised even me in his attempt at comparing the unhinged James Fetzer and his &quot;space rays did 9/11&quot; theory with the recent documentary vote and the mods&#39; correct response, meanwhile continuing to extol Jones and his supposed virtues. </p>

<p>(...as for what I&#39;m personally inclined to believe, the silly feud between Jones and Fetzer is distracting from, well...<a href="http://wheredidthetowersgo.com/">I&#39;ll just leave this here</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>today, I just saw this clever stunt pulled again. This time, by some of the Mods of r/conspiracy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So are the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods the Fetzer to your Jones? I suppose Fetzer <em>is</em> the lesser of two evils, so I can live with that.</p>

<p>If this was a &quot;stunt,&quot; it certainly was a long time in the making.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/2bs5zp/rconspiracy_documentary_of_the_week_archive/">Here&#39;s a link to all the previous voting threads and winners going back to July</a>. </p>

<p>Nothing has ever been manipulated...the winners were all very clear cut each time. In this most recent case, the combined votes from three different users suggesting the film made it the obvious winner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t watched to whole thing. But I&#39;ve watched a couple hours of it and I can say, incontrovertibly, the documentary &quot;Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told&quot; is Neo-Nazi propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe you should watch the whole thing? As a rational and mature adult, shouldn&#39;t you be able to fully &quot;know your enemy&quot; before utterly denouncing him?</p>

<p>Personally, I thought the film was too long. I thought it played off of emotion instead of appealing to those who are inclined to a more rational approach to such sensitive subjects. It <em>was</em> a bit of a turn off...the film is most definitely flawed.</p>

<p>However, after seeing this whole fiasco at the top of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a>, and <a href="/r/worstof">/r/worstof</a>, I couldn&#39;t be more staunch in my defense of this sub and this choice.</p>

<p>I appreciated this movie for at least giving me another perspective. It was very clear, from the beginning, that the creators were biased (see pretty much every other documentary ever made). </p>

<p>&quot;Hitler was the tits&quot; was <em>not</em> something I took away from this film. What I <em>did</em> take away was the notion that working with Stalin was not even close to the &quot;necessary evil&quot; that is sold to us today as the justification for defeating Germany.</p>

<p>Even if you accept the &quot;official&quot; narrative of the 20th century, Stalin was <em>at the very least</em> on par with the cruelty of Hitler. And yet, if this sub featured a film on the barbaric reign of Stalin, with a picture of Stalin, no one would&#39;ve batted an eye.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t that speak volumes?</p>

<p>As for the segment on the Holocaust, David Cole has made it very clear that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Republican-Party-Animal-Hollywoods-Underground/dp/1936239914/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411683765&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=republican+party+animal">evidence suggests that there were only 4 extermination camps, instead of 6</a>. </p>

<p>Did you know I could be arrested and <em>imprisoned</em> in numerous countries, especially Germany, for saying I believed there were only 4 extermination camps, not 6?</p>

<p>This is one of the most ludicrous things I can imagine in a supposedly modern world, especially since evidence suggests that there were indeed, at <em>most</em> 4 camps where mass extermination occurred. </p>

<p>If you agree with throwing someone in prison for writing those words, then perhaps you need to rethink what type of world you want your children to inherit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the moderators of r/conspiracy who allowed this film to be branded on to this Sub, are using the repulsiveness of Naziism to discredit the people who dare to ask the questions that power want&#39;s us to ignore, then you are my enemy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you for real? This will be featured for about a week, and then it will be added to a growing list of featured documentaries on this sub.</p>

<p>If someone feels this sub has been &quot;branded&quot; because of this, then I guarantee they had already made up their mind about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, whether they realize it or not.</p>

<p>Reviving the featured documentary routine is one of the best things that&#39;s happened to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> recently, and I know I&#39;m not the only one who feels that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a decent place to aggregate news and info that one wouldn&#39;t find easily elsewhere. Important things that happen in the shadows of power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you truly believe that, why are half your comments shitting on stuff people post here? </p>

<p>Is it only &quot;important&quot; if you deem it so?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have now, very likely, killed it. And fuck you for that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this film was stickied, the sub has grown by a few thousand. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not going to change anything. In a week, there will be another featured documentary, and the conspiratard/SRD folks will have to wait for another mass circle jerk. </p>

<p>Perhaps they&#39;ll get what they want if a documentary wins that questions Sandy Hook or vaccines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But don&#39;t think you have won. As long as there&#39;s an internet, we will keep aggregating. And the truth will keep getting spread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s much too silly. </p>

<p>OP, I respect your right to be silly, but I feel the need to point out just how silly you sound.</p>

<p>Are there any good reasons for keeping the image there?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll probably get banned again for saying this - but the mods were <em>not just ignoring the requests</em> - they were actively deleting threads discussing the issue and banning users who complained about it (<a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/new/">https://pay.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/new/</a> - one user just posted a &quot;Poisoning the Well&quot; article and got it yanked)...</p>

<p>Makes perfect sense, right? Mods claim to be against censorship, but censor posts and ban people who bring the issue up--so it looks like, to outsiders (who were all coming in to check us out during that fantastic AskReddit thread yesterd), everyone here are raging Hitler-lovers who are honky-dory staring at a bright-red image of his mug all day...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? You replied to me 3 days ago? I didn&#39;t get any alert. </p>

<p>How do you respond proportionately to someone else mocking the very reason you live? Get mad but not to the point where the jokes get removed? The whole point of being offended and complaining is to see action take place in removing these insults.  </p>

<p>You fail to understand that religion is a serious and extremely personal matter to the majority of Muslims, and is not treated even close to <em>your football team</em> or <em>country</em>. Christians may want to allow the mountain load of Jesus jokes, but that is why christians per generation are christian by name,  and really athiest. You&#39;re the only one acting like a child, if you think its okay for people to mock each other&#39;s values. </p>

<p>You cant respect that people can take religion seriously? that&#39;s your problem, you have no right in telling Muslims to not try their best to remove comics that insult their existence. To them this insult is spreading to others and defining Islam to the readers as some asinine death cult. You think they shouldn&#39;t try to censor that?    </p>

<p>&#39;favorite desert prophet&#39; It seems you couldnt resist even adding a joke of your own? if you strongly believe that religion is all fantasy, why dont you discuss it maturely? Making jokes about it can only incite anger (like with me for example, im steaming, not because im &#39;infantile&#39; but because rude remarks give me the feeling you will never share your reasoning with another Muslim. Likewise it shows the joke writers would never conceive of discussing anything with a Muslim, their sole objective was to insult them and move on and thats what really pisses them off.)</p>

<p>edit: I come to this subreddit often and I have scarcely seen a topic on Islam in particular, I noticed however that many of the links that I enjoy reading are posted by you. I feel horrible we argued like this, so ill back off with a sorry.  </p>

<p>The reason the first one was chosen was because it was directly associated with the actual film.</p>

<p>Perhaps the red made it so jarring.</p>

<p>It will be replaced soon, then this will all be ancient history.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe the fucking brouhaha and the <em>moaning</em> and the <em>whining</em> and the <em>kvetching</em> over that fucking image. <strong>Get in trouble</strong> for having a mocking caricature of famous political personality on your screen? Some days I wonder if I&#39;m living in a freakish parallel universe.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a shocker: <strong>The original artwork was done by an ISRAELI ARTIST</strong> - one of many similar &quot;portraits&quot;.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/07/28/noma-bar-guess-who/">Noma Bar’s Minimalist Vector Portraits of Cultural Icons</a></strong></p>

<p>Here is the original - juxtaposed to a <em>plagiarized version</em> that appeared on the cover of - wait for it - <strong>Przekrój, Poland&#39;s oldest weekly news magazine</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/assets_c/2011/09/nomabarcopycat-thumb-615x438-62303.jpg">PNSFW???</a></strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/lessons-in-plagiarism-from-przekr-j-polands-oldest-weekly/244553/">2011 Atlantic article</a> on the plagiarism.</p>

<p>So all of this whining and handwriting has been because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was SO INSENSITIVE that it posted a (totally excellent) piece of art done by an <strong>Israeli Jew</strong> on its sidebar???</p>

<p><strong>ARE YOU PEOPLE FUCKING CRAZY???</strong> Grow a pair!</p>

<p>Here are a few more of Noma Bar&#39;s totally excellent pieces - which of THESE will you whiners say are NSFW?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nomabar_guesswho_stalin.jpg">Josef Stalin</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nomabar_guesswho_nelsonmandela.jpg">Nelson Mandela</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nomabar_guesswho_kimjongil.jpg">Kim Jong Il</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nomabar_guesswho_margaretthatcher.jpg">Margaret Thatcher</a></p>

<p>and of course <strong><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nomabar_guesswho_hitler.jpg">NSFW!!!!</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Is ISIS scary?</strong></p>

<p>No, ISIS isn&#39;t scary - the idea of living in a culture and a time where one could &quot;get in trouble&quot; for having a minimalist caricature of Adolf Hitler on your monitor - THAT IS FUCKING SCARY.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I&#39;m going to repost this in the main documentary thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im im favor of the no-censorship ideology, but i did hear <em>one</em> good reason why folks wanted that image out of the sidebar.</p>

<p>You see, many of us peruse reddit while at work, or otherwise not in the privacy of our own domain. Naturally, we feel comfortable checking up on this site daily. </p>

<p>But, imagine being at work (on your phone while at break, for instance) and checking up on your favorite sub, r/conspiracy. A coworker walks by just as the page loads and the striking red image of hitler pops up before you have the chance to realize it. Now, youre at risk of having this social stigma, the scarlet letter, placed upon you at work. This could only affect the workplace negatively, and is a risk we should be subjected to.  Thus, the lack of a NSFW tag for the sidebar image is a decent argument.</p>

<p>Now, i dont really follow that argument, as i believe if youre gonna go om r/conspiracy at work, you take responsibility for whatever might be up there. To me, its NSFW no matter the images that load. But, i acknowledge thst this is a fairly valid argument.</p>

<p>The new sidebar image works much better, imo...</p>

I haven&#39;t seen the movie and didn&#39;t vote in the thread, so I can&#39;t complain.  I can&#39;t defend the movie itself, but I defend the movie being posted and the existence of the sticky discussion thread.  That&#39;s free speech, and I&#39;m all for it.</p>

<p>If axolotl_peyotl defends the movie, I will stand by him.</p>

<p>I cannot defend the image.  It is now up to the mods to defend the image or replace it.  I have offered a replacement image.  It&#39;s not great, but I think it gets the job done.</p>

<p>If the image is to stay, I would like a reply to this post explaining why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a well written and an excellent response to what I fear will not be the last of &quot;this sub is doomed&quot; metaposts.</p>

<p>I saw that thread when it was posted <del>it</del> as well and I was just as skeptical of laborinvain&#39;s intentions, as well as the <em>apparently</em> popular support for it. Whether he had a legitimate concern or not. in my opinion his sentiment would cause more damage to this sub than a featured controversial film ever could, a film by the way that will be replaced by another otherwise less topic-sensitive one in a weeks-time.</p>

<p>Frankly, because he was encouraging users to leave this sub, encouraging pointless metadrama such as &quot;someone has to be banned for this&quot; and &quot;a mod has to step down&quot;. Ask yourselves, do we really want multitudes of meaningless posts demanding mods to step down, again? Posts stating it&#39;s time to leave? We got a good thing going here, and it will remain that way if we all keep a cool head.</p>

<p>As for the stickied post, either watch the film, then discuss your disagreements it in the comments of the thread, or don&#39;t, and accept that this subreddits &quot;reputation&quot; cannot be damaged, groups have tried for years. People with negative views about this community have likely made up their minds already about conspiracy-related subject matter and the people interested in it. And if one film featured here feeds their confirmation bias, then they are irrelevant and probably like the smell of their own farts.</p>

<p>If the sidebar offends you, just laugh it off. Like seriously he has a fucking barcode for a mustache. It&#39;s a hilarious depiction. It&#39;s also the documentary cover, and will also be gone in a week. *EDIT; It has been replaced by one that shouldn&#39;t at all be &quot;NSFW&quot; A fair compromise IMO.</p>

<p>As for the Fetzer-Jones situation thanks for clearing that up axolotl, I was interested, but lacked the motivation to look into it.</p>

<p>Final thoughts: If you have 6-hours to burn, you know what to do. If not, don&#39;t waste the time you have complaining or worrying about what other people think of this sub, and instead contribute your own (preferably positive) content.</p>

<p>Even if you accept the &quot;official&quot; narrative of the 20th century, Stalin was at the very least on par with the cruelty of Hitler. And yet, if this sub featured a film on the barbaric reign of Stalin, with a picture of Stalin, no one would&#39;ve batted an eye.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t that speak volumes?</p>

<p>And still, this. I think it would be funny if you chose to go with <a href="http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/7c/e5/0d/7ce50d8bf390ac1bf1610cbe122a2ff3.jpg">this</a>.</p>
