       Time is of the essence. Reddit.com and AMERICAN FREE PRESS readers should apply strong pressure on both houses of Congress to revive this movement to make the Fed Reserve history. Call Capitol Hill at 202-224-3121 or 225-3121.

       i was thinking about this the other day, and i don't think abolishing the federal reserve would solve all of our problems. if we abolished it entirely we would have no way to regulate interest rates on loans at all, and the banks would take advantage of that by forming a hidden trust. we need to break up the individual FR banks, and by that i mean prohibiting corporations or individuals buying stock in the federal reserve banks. they need to be operated by elected officials, and owned by the taxpayers at an equal, flat rate. then, usury should be banned altogether, even in the federal reserve. adjusting interest rates might lead to "growth," but growth is not sustainable. virtually all the misery in the world can be traced, in one way or another, back to growth. if we work in a sustainable economy, where nobody is enslaved by debt, we will have far fewer problems, and we will be much better equipped to deal with the other problems in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       just my opinion, i'm not an economist. but i think most independent economists would agree that no federal reserve is almost as bad as the federal reserve system we have now. even ben bernanke agreed that the federal reserve could use some congressional amendments. but i don't think you'd find any educated economists suggesting that the federal reserve should be abolished altogether. the federal reserve was passed by the american people under the pretext that it would allow the government to regulate interest rates on loans, which is a very important thing. even hitler regulated interest rates... he abolished them altogether, in fact. the american people never would have signed up for the fed if it didn't serve this single, vital function. but the federal reserve act included a lot more than this, considering it was written by the banksters themselves, and these are the parts we need to amend or remove. the federal reserve act wasn't 100% bullshit, so we should conserve that teeny tiny 5% that actually helps us.

       So in essence you unknowingly agree with OP as the above-suggestion equates to an abolishment of the federal reserve in its current form (private banking conglomerate), and replacing it with a genuine publicly owned and operated monetary device as contemplated by our Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       See USC Art. 1, Sec. 8, which states, in relevant part:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Congress shall have power to . . . coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures.

       but the other way of dealing with this is to support the barter movement, and use gold, bitcoin, or both! if everybody gets on the bandwagon, then the federal reserve will have literally no impact on our lives at all. every chance you get to conduct a transaction using gold, bitcoin, or simple trade, is an opportunity to free yourself and others from the shackles of the fed. we will never be able to "convince" politicians to abolish the bankers' tentacle grip on the federal reserve; who do you think funds their campaigns?
      </p>
      <p>
       what we can do is stop using their currency. i find that small businesses are more likely to agree to trade or take alternative currencies. and it just so happens that these are the businesses i want to support. if you can find someone who sells what you're looking for, and he/she is willing to barter/trade for it, or take gold or bitcoins, then go for it! you are not only supporting financial freedom worldwide in your own small way, but you're also supporting that small, innocent business :P
      </p>
      <p>
       i hope that this movement catches on and people start setting up their own bartering marketplaces. it would help a lot to return to our roots of trading the results of our own specialized skills. and it really feels great to be viscerally involved with, and productive in my community.

       Bitcoin is fiat. The way current problems are prevented with bitcoin is the creation. In regular fiat you have a select few people who control the printing press.
      </p>
      <p>
       In bitcoin anyone can control the printing press but they basically control it like a lottery. You play to win but you don't always win. If you want to win more you need to get more computers that are faster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problems with counterfeiting which traditional fiat and gold itself have aren't existent in bitcoin.
