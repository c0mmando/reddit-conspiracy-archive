What if the moon is there as it always has been but you are only seeing a projected image of an empty moon to hide some thing/s on it? Could it be out of the realm of possibilities for for someone to want to obscure our look at the moon? Again this is something that I would file with lizard people and other silliness, but some of it is still fun to ponder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that would only give evidence to the fact that his camera/data is not working correctly or been altered or misinterpreted in some way. The moon has been forcing our tides for over a billion years. We have been basing calendars on it for thousands of years. There are cave paintings of it. There are ancient stories about it. To assume it&#39;s fake is the most ludicrous idea that I&#39;ve ever seen entertained in the community. I can&#39;t even believe I&#39;m arguing with someone that the moon is real.</p>

<p>The first wave went out of frame and then came back in when the camera adjusted so it&#39;s almost certainly not a result of his equipment.</p>

TL;DR : since the air&#39;s refraction index varies with its temperature, thermal activity in the atmosphere (i.e. heat released by a parking lot) can produce this waving pattern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that certainly is a good answer, and it <em>may</em> be correct.</p>

<p>but i&#39;m going to make a suggestion; that you make every effort to keep an open mind, as <strong>&quot;</strong>time moves forward<strong>&quot;</strong> --  if you continue to believe what <em>you</em> have been <em>told</em> is <em>true</em> only to discover it&#39;s <em>not</em>, then your closed, hard, mind/reality will crack like a dry rock and turn to dust. </p>

<p>the substance of the universe <em>is</em> consciousness, and as some of us believe that we have been/are still being manipulated, we are now aware of it.</p>

<p>You really should. The whole premise that people went walking around on the moon a half century ago is completely preposterous. Yet it&#39;s a belief widely and unquestioningly held by the vast majority of people. Here&#39;s a long video looking at the small amount of physical evidence that does exist </p>

<p>Actually not! It&#39;s been verified by some of the best out there that work with digital video and digital photography (dpreview forums) as well as also being filmed by some German Astronomer of the same wave across the screen that filmed the effect, but nobody has EVER duplicated it by any refresh or anything else for that matter by any of  professional or amateur yet, and there are some good ones.</p>

<p>Look at the first wave he filmed. It goes out of frame and then catches up. It can&#39;t be refreshing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you - sorry if I wasn&#39;t clear.  In this case, I think the high percentage of downvotes combined with the low number of actual comments (let alone negative ones) is interesting.

<p>One thing, what do you think of Stanley Kubricks potential involvement with faking the moon landing and does that fit in with any of your theories / views on the moon / moon landing? I watched a great documentary on it and it is honestly so compelling.</p>
