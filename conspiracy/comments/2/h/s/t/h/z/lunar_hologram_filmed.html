       I completely agree with you - sorry if I wasn't clear.  In this case, I think the high percentage of downvotes combined with the low number of actual comments (let alone negative ones) is interesting.  I've noticed this a lot for posts on this sub about certain "fringe topics" such as this.

       The more time, money, and effort that's spent trying to suppress the truth, the more obvious the suppression becomes.  I think you're right - the house of cards seems to be getting more exposed by the day.

       Am I going crazy here? This is a video claiming the moon is fake. The MOON is FAKE?! You saw a warble in your video and now that's evidence that one of the most universal things recorded throughout ALL human history is a projection? I will be downvoted to hell, but this is THE stupidest conspiracy theory that I've seen.

       I'm with you, but let's step back and think about it for a second. What if the moon landing was used to set up some projections of some sort? What if the moon is there as it always has been but you are only seeing a projected image of an empty moon to hide some thing/s on it? Could it be out of the realm of possibilities for for someone to want to obscure our look at the moon? Again this is something that I would file with lizard people and other silliness, but some of it is still fun to ponder.

       But that would only give evidence to the fact that his camera/data is not working correctly or been altered or misinterpreted in some way. The moon has been forcing our tides for over a billion years. We have been basing calendars on it for thousands of years. There are cave paintings of it. There are ancient stories about it. To assume it's fake is the most ludicrous idea that I've ever seen entertained in the community. I can't even believe I'm arguing with someone that the moon is real.

       The first wave went out of frame and then came back in when the camera adjusted so it's almost certainly not a result of his equipment.

       TL;DR : since the air's refraction index varies with its temperature, thermal activity in the atmosphere (i.e. heat released by a parking lot) can produce this waving pattern.

       but i'm going to make a suggestion; that you make every effort to keep an open mind, as
       <strong>
        "
       </strong>
       time moves forward
       <strong>
        "
       </strong>
       --  if you continue to believe what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       have been
       <em>
        told
       </em>
       is
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       only to discover it's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       , then your closed, hard, mind/reality will crack like a dry rock and turn to dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       the substance of the universe
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       consciousness, and as some of us believe that we have been/are still being manipulated, we are now aware of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: but hey - you might be right, but what if you're wrong?

       I'm all for keeping an open mind, but not to the point of letting my brain drop on the floor... I've experienced many supernatural things in my life for which I have no "scientific" explanation (I kinda have working hypothesis though).. but a holographic moon conspiracy (that benefits whom exactly?) is simply too stretched out to be taken seriously.

       That first "wave" is most certainly not circular and looks like a digital artifact (perfectly horizontal, pixel-aligned). As for the "surface hug", you seem to have a hard time understanding the concept of refraction and how it affects the travelling of light.

       You really should. The whole premise that people went walking around on the moon a half century ago is completely preposterous. Yet it's a belief widely and unquestioningly held by the vast majority of people. Here's a long video looking at the small amount of physical evidence that does exist

       One thing, what do you think of Stanley Kubricks potential involvement with faking the moon landing and does that fit in with any of your theories / views on the moon / moon landing? I watched a great documentary on it and it is honestly so compelling.

       In the 90's I saw a solar eclipse over Illinois and it seemed very clearly caused by the moon...so how was that fake?  Btw you even get a strange double shadow effect on the ground from this phenomena...caused by sunlight coming around the sides of the moon.

       No information on how this was recorded immediately yells out amateur to me, same with no atmospheric conditions, which holy shit would be important to the relevant parties to know. No independent verification, like more than one person not recording this phenomena yells out hoax to me.

       Actually not! It's been verified by some of the best out there that work with digital video and digital photography (dpreview forums) as well as also being filmed by some German Astronomer of the same wave across the screen that filmed the effect, but nobody has EVER duplicated it by any refresh or anything else for that matter by any of  professional or amateur yet, and there are some good ones.

       If you can hide the entire surface of the moon from view (no one can see the true face of the moon). Then you can do anything you want without worry of being seen or discovered. It's the same principle of camouflage during times of war. If the enemy (the people) can see what you are up to, they cannot stop you.

       Look at the first wave he filmed. It goes out of frame and then catches up. It can't be refreshing.

       We're talking about the hologram cover refreshing.  Not his camera or atmospheric conditions.

       I completely agree with you - sorry if I wasn't clear.  In this case, I think the high percentage of downvotes combined with the low number of actual comments (let alone negative ones) is interesting.  I've noticed this a lot for posts on this sub about certain "fringe topics" such as this.

       Can't have this post getting to the top of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       where it will be seen by thousands of people, after all.

       One thing, what do you think of Stanley Kubricks potential involvement with faking the moon landing and does that fit in with any of your theories / views on the moon / moon landing? I watched a great documentary on it and it is honestly so compelling.
