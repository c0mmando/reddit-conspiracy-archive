       There is a sub on reddit called
       <a href="/r/digitalcartel">
        /r/digitalcartel
       </a>
       where several redditors congregate to "chat and debate" according to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that this sub was created by
       <a href="/u/thedigitalking">
        /u/thedigitalking
       </a>
       who is an alt of a conspiratard user.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story begins a little over a year ago when I noticed a user here posting YouTube videos they had made featuring them self sitting on a porch swing talking about their delusions (schizophrenic delusions).  This person thinks they are God and also the king of the CIA (whatever that means).  It was mostly harmless but a little disturbing to see this person suffering from a real mental illness and broadcasting it over YouTube.   The deeper they explored their own delusions the more it became clear that this person had the potential to cause harm to others.  They believed that natural disasters like hurricane sandy and national tragedies like the sandy hook shooting were done by the CIA specifically to punish them.  Regardless of your opinion of who did sandy hook or if lanza had any accomplices, I think we can all agree that they didn't so it to punish a kid named Eric who suffers from schizophrenia and thinks that he is god.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is where things went out of bounds in my opinion.  Some trolls that plague us here and are constantly on the lookout for anything they can use to "make us evil" noticed this kid and latched onto him.  They started feeding his delusions and calling themselves "his disciples".  They created a special subreddit for him where he is the central figure, you can read about his delusions yourself in their sticky post.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kid claims the navy yard shooter was being mind controlled in the same way that he himself is being mind controlled.  He talks about building a lead hut to escape from the voices.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ring leader there is a user
       <a href="/u/thedigitalking">
        /u/thedigitalking
       </a>
       , who has tried everything to get /conspiracy to make him or
       <a href="/u/ewolv">
        /u/ewolv
       </a>
       a mod here, or to get us to feature his story with a sticky.
      </p>
      <p>
       When denied they have made threats and "put us on a kill list"
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/u/thedigitalking">
        /u/thedigitalking
       </a>
       talks to ewolv over skype and there is no telling what evil seeds he has planted in his mind there.  But its clear that 'king' supports and reinforces this poor sick kid's delusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       'King' has become this kids handler and he does everything and anything except steer this kid back towards reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the list of mods over there in their special subreddit you'll even find people there who are mods of prominent sub reddits like
       <a href="/r/askscience">
        /r/askscience
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that they intend to push this kid toward some kind of violent outburst IRL and then blame it all on /conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this, I have been keeping detailed logs of all the threats made to us in mod mail and the users inflating his ego in
       <a href="/r/digitalcartel">
        /r/digitalcartel
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It all sounds like silly madness to us here but I remind you that the navy yard shooter tried to get help before his killing spree and people turned him away because they didn't see it as a serious matter.
      </p>

      <p>
       These are just a few examples of the threats we've received from 'king'.  Keep in mind that 'king' is perfectly sane and is preying upon ewolv who is suffering from a serious mental disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going public with this now because you can see for yourself how deep into the delusions ewolv has sunk.

      <p>
       Hopefully they were "unaware" of his schizophrenia when they created a cult following for him..  otherwise that is just fucked up.

       Flytape thinks that there is a shady group of people trying to discredit the subreddit he moderates, he thinks they're using CIA brainwashing methods which another used FerroFluid describes as being like 'MKUltra' and that their method will be to cause a violent rampage akin to Sandy Hook...

       The difference being that ewolv is admittedly schizophrenic and not on any meds.

       Mhmm.  I think you have a few things mixed up here.  I was added there fairly early on in that sub.  I was member 23 or something back when it was a private sub.   This was back when you needed to be nominated to join.  I still dont know who nominated me.

       <a href="/u/thedigitalking">
        /u/thedigitalking
       </a>
       is not sane like you suggest but crazy as well.  For some reason he decided to mod a few people who did not share his ideals and have a trollish side.   After the admins removed him as the top mod there he cant get rid of them now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he wants to mod here because he feels your users will believe him over regular users, sticky his message to gain more followers.  I dont think he is trying to troll you.

       <a href="/u/ewolv">

       Yes he is getting worse.  I wonder if it has anything to do with his perception of having a bunch of disciples?  Regardless of why he is getting worse, when he breaks and hurts himself or someone else, if it makes national news I will be releasing my documents to the media.

       It's hard to tell if it's his  disciples are hurting or helping him.  If I was psychotic I much rather have people who tell me in not crazy and offer words of encouragement than people who call me crazy.  I'm no doctor thought so maybe they are hurting him more.

       We aren't disciples, that's just a word. I did the css for the sub and I thought it was funny and it fits the theme of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll just cut and paste my explanation of what is happening there because I don't want this false idea of thedigitalcartel being spread around,
      </p>
      <p>
       What is going on is you have one guy that is schizophrenic who thinks he is Christ returned, and another guy that believes in revelations in the bible and the second coming of Christ. Put them together, and they feed off each other. Everyone else that is there is normal and we do not support Eric's belief that he is Christ nor do we encouraging violence in any way.
So actually the people there are good decent people. It is the digitalking that is threatening people and we haven't the slightest clue why.

       Is that what you'll tell the cops? Don't worry they'll NEVER find out the truth because all your information and activity is private hahaha. Guess maybe you conspiratards shouldve paid more attention to reality. How ironic.

       I don't know. Could be juvenile bullying of a mentally ill person or could be criminal cyber bullying, criminal mischief,  conspiracy to commit murder. Leave it to the authorities to figure out.

       It's not that deep, dude.  You're a small group of trolls and snooneters who have devoted time to trolling a schizophrenic kid and telling him where to put his sharpies.  Some of you are obsessed with satirizing the occult, some of you are ruthlessly trying to further his delusion, some of you are probably just kids who play too many video games and have poor judgement and somehow don't realize that your sub is a terrible and malicious idea.

       you're a troll who probably only uses this account because you got banned from your last one.  Jesus dude, look at you- your karma to comment ration is under .5.  you clearly have very little of value to contribute.  The first sub you even joined was one devoted to harassing a mentally ill guy.  Think about that and hope that he doesn't do anything that necessitates an investigation of you and your fellow trolls.

       Oh I'm sorry that only popular comments matter to you.  I don't care about karma, fool.  No I've never been banned and I have a few accounts so people like you can't be nosey or stalk me.  You are correct that this account joined that subreddit first.  I am not a troll, but apparently you are.  Get a life, grow a brain...stop blaming others out of rage.

       So fast to judge.  Maybe spend more than a min there.  There a few who actually believe him and some are just there to sympathize.   I really don't see any trolling there for the most part, but maybe something changed.  I haven't visited there since they got over 100 subs.

       I completely disagree with this post.  I'm a mod at
       <a href="/r/digitalcartel">
        /r/digitalcartel

       because some of the posts and discussions there are thought-provoking and interesting.  Eric doesn't seem dangerous to me at all and never has.

       What are you basing your claim that digital king is an alt for a conspiratard user on?

      <p>
       This seems to me like you're just demonizing something that you don't understand and have never even
       <em>
        attempted

       to understand.

       and there you go. Found your flat out lie. You can check a shadowbannes users post history and I see no posts in conspiritard. Making shit up to support your already delusional claims is exactly what I would expect from this subreddit. Ive been pretty into this since I got invited.  You are the most delusional of the three of them to make up this whole "group of bullys" theory. Do you know how often people argue with shit DK says in modmail? Almost everytime.

       His having posted in conspiratard in no way proves that he's some subverter attempting to make
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       Explain the threats then.  Explain how it is not harmful for DK to give Eric the impression that he can mind control people into committing suicide.

       What about the post where DK contacted Rothschild via twitter because "he knows about the mind control"

       You misinterpreted the guy. He's saying the digitalcartel was created
       <em>
        by theDigitalKing to create a cult following for the self proclaimed messiah
       </em>
       BUT as they started inviting people, we realized what was going on and transformed it into something positive, where now it is
       <em>
        a nursery for those with mental wounds and has been used to create a lot of good
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       FFS people will just believe whatever they fucking want. Listen to what I'm telling you. No one is getting their lulz by taking advantage of a mentally ill person.

       That's not what he meant...not a good way to put it really...the fucking place has nothing to do with a cult.  I would even argue it isn't designed to gain a following for EWolv either.  Maybe that is digitalkings intention but I thought we were there to share thoughts and find commonalities and that is where it seems to be going.

       For what its worth I edited my OP to reflect that you guys have an internal exploration of DKs actions going on now.

       Since DK created that sub around Eric and Eric's story is central to it I assumed you all understood that you were dealing with a schizophrenic.  The sticky post there would also support that it was understood.

       You are a narcissist.  That's not a judgment. Just an honest observation given your activity in this thread. Your guilt isn't someone else's fault. It's a natural healthy response. Try being honest with it.

       Right on. Maybe I'm wrong. It would be tragic if this person suffers as a result of bullying and mischief.  If you aren't involved then nothing to say. If you can help this guy or have all ready that's great.

       Interesting. Looking in digitalcartel is a little scary. If there really are over 200 people subbed there just to mess around with ewolv that's pretty fucked up.

       Encouraging someone who is mentally ill into something, whether intentionally or unintentionally can get you a call from the FBI or law enforcement. If people are encouraging this gentleman in one way, and he later turns out to commit a crime, his internet activity will be searched. That means, where he went, who he talked to online, and everything that comes with it. We live in a post 9/11 world, and they will investigate all sites and people he was in contact with.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are found out to have messaged him, or commented that he should pursue something or have encouraged him or egged him on, you could be charged as an accomplice or an accessory. With the world we live in, and the hype up media bullshit, especially in regards to sandy hook. You could land your ass in jail and made an example of (which you should be!), all for seemingly innocent internet bullshittery.

       With that being said, if the sub is truly trolling this mentally ill man. And you lot are doing it for shits and giggles. You deserved to be locked up, because frankly, that's psychopathic, disturbing, and very sadistic.

       The sub is not about trolling the poor guy.  Dear God, this is like Fox News.  Did anyone bother reading into the subreddit at all?  I think recent posts were kind of crappy and I haven't been all that active but I fail to see the trolling unless one were to accuse DigitalKing as a manipulator...he "believes" everything EWolv says...sometimes Ive even wondered if he was an alt of EWolv's.  The thing is, nobody else ever believes the story and most will say so straight up.  As far as I'm aware EWolv does not see any of the subscribers as his disciples or followers or believers even.

       That's not what the sub is about at all, man.  You're talking out of your ass quite frankly.  No one is encouraging Eric to commit any crimes - that's a pretty heavy allegation you're making based on nothing.  Take these empty threats elsewhere.

       You need to understand that this is broadly being attributed to everyone in that sub like we are all in on it just to see how far we can push Eric. That isn't even slightly the case. The Digital Cartel is a place where ANYONE can say ANYTHING without fear of feeling judged or persecuted. At times the mix of people there has evoked some really interesting discussions and has yielded insights you can't find anywhere else on reddit. We are not violent, we are not trolls, we are not evil, we are not exploiting anyone, and we are not disciples of Eric.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is going on is you have one guy that is schizophrenic who thinks he is Christ returned, and another guy that believes in revelations in the bible and the second coming of Christ. Put them together, and they feed off each other. Everyone else that is there is normal and we do not support Eric's belief that he is Christ nor do we encouraging violence in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So actually the people there are good, decent, people. It is the digitalking that is threatening people and we haven't the slightest clue why.

       If you can prove that the DigitalKing is from conspiratard then you should let me know asap... because if so, then the implications are quite damning. If ANYONE is exploiting Eric or pushing him to do anything destructive, the mods wouldn't stand for it. No one other than the digitalking knew of these threats or has any reason to threaten anyone. Personally, I actually think the digitalking is brainwashed by the bible to the point that he is also delusional and this is why he and Eric have latched on to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       the digitalking is exploiting him, it seems to me he really believes all of this stuff and revelations in the bible and the second coming and all of that. But like I said if you can prove he is an alt account of a conspiratard and he is just manipulating Eric let me know and me and the rest of the mods will make sure we put an end to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the natural state of the universe good men will do good things and wicked men will do wicked things. But to make a good man do wicked things? You'll need religion... or a conspiratard it seems.

       Unfortunately back when DK was using conspiratard I didn't really think that this whole thing was a big deal.  I thought that Eric was a fake schizophrenic posting silly shit here for conspiratard to laugh at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once it became apparent to me that Eric was indeed a real schizophrenic with real delusions and DK was attempting to be his handler I started logging everything.  Its unfortunate that DKs participation in conspiratard isn't a part of that log.  We have so many trolls from there that he just blended into the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were you I would purge Eric's sub of DK and urge Eric to get back on his meds and quit using drugs.  Nicotine is documented to inhibit the antipsychotics used to treat schizophrenia and marijuana/alcohol to have undesirable effects.

       Finally, some sane thoughts :p...I am unsure of DigitalKing's intentions as well.  I sort of go teeter between thinking he is a naive believer or a manipulator.  I think he is just naive, but I am ultimately unsure.

       I've seen that subreddit around a bit. I first noticed it when I started getting mod mail demanding that I kneel before the King of Israel or other such nonsense. It would come about once a month and always from a different username, sometimes a shadowbanned one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is very sad, honestly. Eric seems to be a rather intelligent man, a mathematician, who at one point was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It seems the meds stopped working for him and his delusions ordered him to stop taking them altogether. He now thinks that he's some sort of messianic incarnation based on an oddly colored carp he once found. He's been posting on multiple accounts, many of which were banned.
       <a href="/r/digitalcartel">
        /r/digitalcartel
       </a>
       used to be a ground where he would post his ramblings and delusions, but recently has become a sort of conspiracy discussion center. I'm not sure if the members are trolls, schizophrenics or just alt accounts of Eric.

       He never said the discussion was rational LOL.  That's sort of the point.  To say whatever you want to say.  A lot of it is ridiculous, but maybe some find meaning within the words...maybe not...it's art in that sense.

       Are you getting frightened that your juvenile and disgusting behavior might have some repercussions in real life? In reality the authorities WILL issue an order to have reddit reveal your identity. You better hope what you are doing isn't illegal. I don't know you or anything about this. . But sounds like you're involved. You should be afraid.

       You really fucking think that visiting a subreddit and chatting is illegal?  Do you really think that every fucking person there is only there to push this random dude, EWOLV, into committing some sort of violent action?  Give me a break.  It's so easy to come on here and think you're fighting the good fight, but it's not true, man.  How about you investigate what's going on before passing judgement on a group of people like they are one homogeneous entity?

       I joined it once because it was a random invite awhile ago and it sounded interesting.  I've always argued against EWOLV's "reasoning" (and often DigitalKing) and that he needs to seek mental attention.  I don't see the reddit as being devoted to him, although DigitalKing may wish that to be the case.

       Flytape hasn't represented the situation in the best light, as 99% of the users there do not go along with EWOLV, and often tell him he is wrong. Not to generalize the whole subreddit :p  That would be insane if that were really what

       EWOLV's situation is pretty sad, I agree.  The worst part about it is the fact that EWOLV will never believe what anybody says unless his schizobrain agrees with it...so basically nothing anybody can say ever helps him out and he is constantly stuck in his own poor thoughts.  I wonder what his IRL friends and family think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the members on r/DigitalCartel are just curious people who enjoy sharing art, poems, discussing conspiracies, and reading everyone elses' crazy ramblings.  Most users have an understanding that thoughts are thoughts and actions are actions...a fine line.  It is a place to say whatever the fuck you want to say.  99% of the people are not there "for EWOLV" although they provide support and are learning things along the way, I suppose.

       so the sub was made to feed the delusion, but dont worry guys theyre good now...  wat?  is like the church saying sure we touch choir boys, but think of all the souls we save.  im atheist so all that matters is the pesky little thing called truth.  piddling lil kids and making subs for schizos.

       Unbelievable....

      <p>
       You misinterpreted cornroll, intentionally, and ignored my clarification, just to protect your fiction. What Cornroll was saying is that the digitalcartel was created by theDigitalKing to create a cult following for the self proclaimed messiah BUT as they started inviting people, the community started to realize what was going on and that there were delusional and mentally ill people involved and transformed it into something positive, where now
       <em>
        it is a nursery for those with mental wounds and has been used to create a lot of good
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm actually disgusted by the implications of this post and the constant reiteration of lies despite my attempts to bring real clarity to the situation. You people choose whatever dark reality you want to be true and then stick to it even if there is no evidence to support it and THAT is fucked up. I know DigitalKing has crossed the line, Im not defending him and his actions or his threats, but to make up a story just because one guy is delusional and paranoid, and claim there is a whole community of people trying to create the next adam lanza is absurd. Especially when most people here already believe all of these events were false flags, to turn all of the sudden and side with the idea that people are crazy and going to start shooting people, is mind blowing. You fold so easily on the root idea that is peddled in order to push controlling legislation on the people. People are inherently good, not inherently evil. So STOP shoveling the bullshit and start placing blame where it is due. Squarely on the DigitalKing, not because he is evil but because he is under the spell of the bible like billions of others in this world, which was put in place by the establishment 2000 years ago under the control of Constantine, because people started getting wise.

       Whoever said that DigitalCartel was a "cult subreddit" is fucking retarded.  If DigitalKing said that, well then that is what he wishes it were but it's untrue.  It was never a "cult subreddit" LOL.  We all have different beliefs and don't follow a cult leader or specific dogma...in fact that is the point.  Most of us disagree with DigitalKing on many issues, but I feel like we do all try to find similarities beyond them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please understand that only one person may be attempting to manipulate EWOLV (and doubtfully), but definitely not the whole subreddit.  Yes, DigitalKing started the sub, but he isn't any sort of leader, members do not see themselves as disciples, and it is most definitely not a cult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Cornroll you are not retarded but maybe you could have worded it differently haha... its technically true just horrible sounding taken out of context, whatever it doesn't matter :p

       I read the URL Wrong...so had to retype, but that is just retarded of him to make a veiled "threat" like that.  If you feel your life is threatened I would report it, that is up to you.  My personal opinion is that he is just being a keyboard ninja typing from the safety of his computer, using extreme language, so to speak.  However I am not the one who was sent the message so you need to make the decision.

       What is going on is you have one guy that is schizophrenic who thinks he is Christ returned, and another guy that believes in revelations in the bible and the second coming of Christ. Put them together, and they feed off each other. Everyone else that is there is normal and we do not support Eric's belief that he is Christ nor do we encouraging violence in any way.

       You know what else can? Mental illness like Schizophrenia.  You are an idiot.  You should seriously be afraid of any involvement you may have had in this. Based on your responses here you are feeling the guilt.

       Umm no... no I'm not feeling the guilt. I'm feeling fucking pissed off that someone is saying that I am helping to push someone over the edge to the point that they start

       actually it's a lot clever than you might think, a thirty second glance at any significantly complex subject will be enough to confuse anyone but once one starts to understand the language and structure of the information it becomes cohesive and begins to make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society often tends to write off anyone that's outside the mainstream, especially if they can label their condition as a mental illness however the list of geniuses that suffer what'd be considered a serious condition is quite considerable to the mighty greats of philosophy like Nietzsche to the luminaries of the ancient scriptures such as Ezekiel, with great insight often comes great mental stress; in mathematics we see similar things with amazing minds like Nash and Turing -- Turing's insight into the pattens of nature came about exactly because he was seeing the world through a different lens than most people, this mathematical insight into organic systems led to his revolutionary breakthroughs in computational mathematics and without a doubt changed the world as significantly as any scientist or mathematician ever has.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd take hours to get into it to any suitable degree but concepts and structures as described by ewol in regard to the sociological and psychological underpinnings of the modern theology [zeitgeist] explained and unveiled many things which i've been trying to understand for over a decade - I've read hundreds of books on theology including of course most the known holy books, once one begins to understand the structure of allegorical theology it becomes somewhat trivial to group ideas and constructs into established groups, generally it's easy to spot the idealised structure and the patching dogma - that which makes up the construct of the universe from their perspective and all the bits they needed to add or bend to make it work with our reality...
      </p>
      <p>
       the proto-orthodox Christian church in the first century for example has a very gnostic vision of the universe similar to many contemporaneous schools, many of the ideas largely made popular and discovered by the Pythagorean mystery school [and there's another genius with issues] - one can trace the growth of this by noticing how the central core philosophy get's patched in much the same way an evolutionary tree grows; ideas once central to the conceptualization of the Christ figure for example such as the trinity get pushed aside in later incantations of the Christian faith, this being a seemingly final step in it's development from the orginal mathematical ideal and it's use as a bridge between the messianic traditions of the spiritualists and the gnostic teachings of the scholarly traditions [as in, Egypt, Canaan, Greece, etc]
      </p>
      <p>
       to cut a long story short what i'm trying to say is if you understand the mechanics of theology and someone comes along with something that's not just kinda novel but actually goes right back to the very core issue and makes a change without it needing a million patches to get it to harmonise - that's actually really interesting. Kinda like editing the linux kernal while it's running and not causing any crashes with anything...
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus is quoted as saying 'when you were one you became two, now you are two what will you do?' i don't know but i'm guessing this doesn't speak volumes to you? yet with an understanding of the gnostic perspective and a few bits of framework understood [such as 'as above, so below' and 'i am the alpha and the omega'] there's actually a lot in these statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       am i saying he's literally an incarnation of a divine christ? maybe, that depends very much on your interpretation and perspective on the christ, the divine, what it means to exist and to be an incarnation - i think there are likely many people who could and should be called christs; of course this doesn't mean i think he's the mythical person that's said to have walked on water and been martyred - i very much doubt the historicity of Jesus and i don't think that Erik or anyone else is a personification of the eternal christ as sometimes described [either a literal divinity or personified absolute].

       Fuckers are off their meds again. I tried having a coherent conversation with ewolv and DK's host of puppet accounts in the past, and it led me to nothing but confusion and pity. The human mind is truly a fragile thing.

       I would wager a lot of the subs there have nothing do to with conforming to the designed intent. Not that anyone needs to be defending their interactions on reddit.

      <p>
       In fact if one were to have a genuine interest in social integrity like this a more pressing issue would be the corporate interest in creating cult followings to craft delusional states in groups for profit. If you are seriously concerned about "Eric" then you should be contacting him directly with your concerns and handling threats with their issuers and other involved parties.

       The DigitalKing believes in revelations in the bible and the second coming of christ and ewolv is schizophrenic and thinks he is Christ returned. The two are feeding off each other. No one other than the digital king supports ewolvs fantasy and for some reason you keep reiterating "these people" like there is some sort of group of people dedicated to fucking with Eric's head and people are upvoting you for your fiction because it's the "white knight" thing to do. Stop. It's not true.

       Well first of all, he could get his facts straight. There is no group of trolls exploiting Eric, and the DigitalKing isn't a troll, he believes in revelations from the bible and the second coming of christ. It's a common mental illness growing out of the pages of the bible.

       And hear me out, but what if he is a troll, is well-versed enough in biblical text, and uses that knowledge to further convince Erik of his (for lack of a better word) delusions, to further an agenda?

       I agree. If through this person's yt account you can figure out approx where he lives the authorities should be contacted.

       If that is how he expresses his feelings, so be it.  What's your issue?   Why can a rockstar say what he wants but a user on a public subreddit can't?  It's a separate issue if he is trolling/manipulating EWolv though.

       Explain the threats then.  Explain how it is not harmful for DK to give Eric the impression that he can mind control people into committing suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the post where DK contacted Rothschild via twitter because "he knows about the mind control"

       This is all very clearly feeding someone's psychosis.

       Right on. Maybe I'm wrong. It would be tragic if this person suffers as a result of bullying and mischief.  If you aren't involved then nothing to say. If you can help this guy or have all ready that's great.

        You need to understand that this is broadly being attributed to everyone in that sub like we are all in on it just to see how far we can push Eric. That isn't even slightly the case. The Digital Cartel is a place where ANYONE can say ANYTHING without fear of feeling judged or persecuted.

       It's not that deep, dude.  You're a small group of trolls and snooneters who have devoted time to trolling a schizophrenic kid and telling him where to put his sharpies.  Some of you are obsessed with satirizing the occult, some of you are ruthlessly trying to further his delusion, some of you are probably just kids who play too many video games and have poor judgement and somehow don't realize that your sub is a terrible and malicious idea.
