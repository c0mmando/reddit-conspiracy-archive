       There's a big hubbub about GM crops potentially being harmful.  I don't know about that, but I tend to think the genetic modification is safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have two issues with Monsanto's GM products.
      </p>
      <p>
       One, most of what we call GMOs are "Roundup Ready" crops, which means these crops are drenched in and soak up pest-, herb-, and insecticides.  Sure, clean them before you eat them, but we are fooling ourselves if we think those chemicals are only on the surface.  (This is what I believe to be the true danger of Roundup Ready crops)
      </p>
      <p>
       Two, there are major ethical questions that have started to come up and will only become more relevant.  Right now,  Monsanto
       <em>
        owns
       </em>
       all of it's  GM seeds, and all of those seeds' offspring.  This poses an interesting hypothetical:  As the rules stand now, if someone creates a genetically modified human, does the former
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       the latter?  What if that GM human has offspring, are they "owned" too??

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       False, it is not "drenched". The amount of glyphosate that can be applied is highly regulated. Further more, the timing of the application is also regulated. For example, it is
       <a href="http://thesoyreport.blogspot.com/2012/09/a-review-of-glyphosate-use-for.html">
        illegal to apply glyphosate to soy after R2 (full bloom)
       </a>
       , mainly to avoid exposure to the developing beans.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of this, glyphosate is considered much safer than the herbicides it replaces.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Monsanto owns all of it's GM seeds, and all of those seeds' offspring
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
       <li>
        GM seeds are patented by various corporations and universities, not just exclusively Monsanto.
       </li>
       <li>
        These entities do not "own" their GM seeds in perpetuity. Rather they have temporary (20 years) exclusive use of the specific technology that they've patented. The first round of Monsanto's glyphosate tolerant corn is just coming of patent.
       </li>
       <li>
        You or anyone else is free to develop (GE or hybrid) a unique seed trait and have it patented. The plant patent framework has been in place since 1930. Hybrid seeds have been patented long before GMOs arrived.
       </li>
       <li>
        GMOs are highly regulated, they must undergo FDA, EPA and USDA testing and approval. The approval process is long and costly (10 years), only large companies can afford this. Ironically, the anti-GMO movement actually benefits Monsanto, since they are the ones calling for more regulation. More regulation means small biotech companies and universities can't afford to go through the expensive approval process.
       </li>

       I agree with this completely. GMOs have the potential to be useful, but currently seem to only be used in a way to increase profit, not nutrition.

       It looks like an idea with good intentions got caught up in corporation crap. I don't think that the research should have been directly used for profit. It should have been expanded on. All of the research should have been made accessible so other scientists can learn how to manipulate plants and invent new techniques. If that happened maybe humans could invent a crop that is truly needed. Instead they went straight for commercialization, which made the whole thing stagnate in legal issues.

       I have no problem with GMO food. If the academia cult followers believe it's safe than so be it. Now, there should be clear labeling laws in grocery stores on what contains GMO or not. Let the people decide what they put into their bodies. If people had to choose between an organic apple or a genetically modified apple, which both were clearly labeled and priced equally. Than what do you think people would choose?

       If the GMO apple was cheaper than the "organic" apple, then I would easily choose the GMO apple every time.

       The implied conclusion is GMO is safe for human consumption. But that is not what this study has any grounds in concluding. Monsanto knows most of it's mindless supporters will overlook this painful truth.

       What constitutes a "GMO contaminate"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we agree that the study ASSUMES that any GMO contaminate is safe? Or is it suggesting a contaminate would be unhealthy for human consumption? The whole study is completely pointless and concludes nothing of value. It's totally meant for lay people to believe GMO argri is all good. That's the implied take away. And based on the comments in
       <a href="/r/science">

       that's what is being promoted.

       That is not the primary conclusion.

      <p>
       "did not reveal unfavorable or perturbed trends in livestock health and productivity."

      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of the actual measurable health benefit/detriment or sustainability of the feed and the products the study says nothing. But that hasn't stopped the circle jerk over in
       <a href="/r/science">
        /r/science

      <p>
       Again, what are the contaminates they were looking for? I'd say the issue with GMO feed is more about what it sprayed on the feed and the antibiotics added to it as many other studies have shown. Which do make it into the products and humans digestive systems. This study is likely a response to the recent studies highlighting contamination of products that come out of a GMO feed system of agriculture.

      <p>
       This is what I meant.  I was using "GMO Contaminates" instead of GE components.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that statements leads to the inference that milk, meat, and eggs from GE fed animals are safe for consumption.  Again, it doesn't matter what the GE components are if they are not showing up in what we consume.  I'm sure a simple search could show you what those components are if you really need to know.

       We can't tell from this study, that's the problem. The data is manipulated and biased to be pro-gm, the researchers likely came to the conclusion before the evidence was collected. Whether or not gmo are actually bad for you I honestly don't know. I have an opinion, but I can not claim that I'm right. That's not the point. The point is that the research into gmo's is shallow, preconceived, and funded predominantly by people with a large vested interest in one result. It is not science, it's an advertisement
