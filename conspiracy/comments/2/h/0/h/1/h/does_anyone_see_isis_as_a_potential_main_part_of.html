       So, Obama's two terms witnessed the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now, the Islamic State has suddenly emerged and is just about the most depraved military force in the history of mankind. Just like the Financial Crisis was there in 2008 to scare people into electing Obama with his promises of "hope" and "change" and relieving the crisis, now we have ISIS to scare people and help the next President get elected by vowing their destruction.

       How convenient.

       Honestly, I think you're allowing yourself to be metagamed.  Back things up a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you consider what's going on, we're still fighting the cold war.  Every group the US has fought for the last twenty years, is a group that the US created to fight the Russians.  It's an undeniable fact.  We lead the world in manufacturing our own enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The imporant question is "to what end?"  There will be an election, and there will be a next president, but... who it actually is isn't as important as the distraction the process provides.
      </p>
      <p>
       As conspiracy theorists, we should have higher aspirations than petty politics.

       There should be no more elections. We as a people need to examine the whole purpose of this government first. Everyone since JFK has been liars, crooks, treasonous Congress too, last time I checked they had a 9% approval rating this would be the equivalent of a .90/10 on IMDB, would you watch that movie? So why would you allow such garbage to influence our laws and policies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wake up to this and see, we can within 1 month I guarantee as a people develop a voting system via internet that is secured and run by multiple unpaid volunteers, with an open source traceable checking system for validity, a logging system that is unaccessible to the voting group. Things that require funding would be reviewed by top quality experts and things requiring  building or engineering should first pass the 2000+ engineers and architects of 9/11 truth. The whole going IN to work in a royal huge senate floor and a huge whitehouse to house a president? How is this not royalty again? Take the power back. No more elections, no more representatives no more laws. Only violent criminals go to prison where there is a system of rehabilitation not pure punishment and animalistic behavior encouraged.
      </p>

       This would not bring chaos it would bring freedom and respsect to a people so in need of it today.

       We need a non-biased, non-partisan government. A neutral entity. The only thing comparable I can imagine is from the recent movie Divergent, where one of the groups (called Enmity) is in charge of the government because they are all neutral, reject vanity and greed, and spend most of their time helping the poor.

       Whqt we need is more names on the ballot. Not the ones they choose is best for the job. I personally dont care who democrats and republicans choose as their candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also dont thing that any of them should get airtime. NONE the media gives preferential treatment. We need to have money taken out of the equation.  Anyone whom is eligible should be allowed to run period.
