Look up the 26 kid choir that performed at the super bowl.. apparently its the kids who were murdered but they are a few years older and the pics of the kids we saw on the news when S.H. happened were actually years old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These theories deserve the same ridicule. They are pathetic. They don&#39;t explain anything, they just lead to more questions.</p>

<p>For example, why are the children the <em>wrong age</em>? Why would anybody put the supposed victims on stage for everybody to see? What&#39;s their motivation?</p>

<p>There&#39;s literally nothing to this theory except <em>someone looks like someone else</em>.</p>

<p>What&#39;s shocking is that <em>anyone</em> believes this theory? Do <em>you</em> believe it? Can you explain to me anything about this theory that would make sense? What are your reasons for believing it?</p>

<p>By the way, I don&#39;t get paid for this. I like researching things and I enjoy arguing with people. I only post things which I have good reason to believe are true. I&#39;ve done a lot of research on these things. For example, I have read almost all of the police reports from the Connecticut State Police about Sandy Hook as well as the district attorney&#39;s report.</p>

<p>Are their any pictures of the remains? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no pictures of anything, except those taken at the &quot;Lanza house&quot; with laminated rental furniture strewn about and glad-bag-and-duct-tape-blocked windows. Also many of the photos are 100% redacted (blacked-out). Ryan&#39;s (the only real child) eyeglasses are mistakenly planted next to the school ID of &quot;Adam&quot;. There are no photos of any bodies. The school has been demolished, as well.</p>

<p>By the way folks, what ever happened to that Halbig character making scenes all over newtown &quot;looking for answers&quot; along side his controlled-op buddy J Fetzer?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The former Florida state trooper, school principal and school safety consultant was accompanied by James H. Fetzer, a former Marine Corps officer, professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota and a prominent figure in the truth community, and Carson City, Nevada trial attorney Day R. Williams, who represented Sirhan Sirhan in 1998.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoever planned this didn&#39;t put too much thought past the &quot;dead young innocent children: TRAGEDY&quot; that was supposed to keep us from asking questions as to not offend anyone. The amount of questionable facts and information was too much to sweep under the rug. Might as well bulldoze the building, problem solved! </p>

<p>Personally, I like the believe certain unsubstantiated theories that make this so much more sinister.</p>

<p>· Theres the typical &quot;they tryna take er guns!&quot; that the tards will counter with the fact that we still have guns. I&#39;m actuality it was to limit the amount of ammo that cam be purchased.</p>

<p>·My fave is the one about how all this was setup to send a message to the Lanza father about how he might want to rethink what he planned to testify at the Libor scandal hearing.</p>

<p>·An off shoot theory about the children and the non decorated school halls involves the global pedophile ring. This was simply a basic learning institution made just for grooming and conditioning future sleeper cells and sex slaves. </p>

<p>Like I said, I have literally NOTHING to back this up lol. It&#39;s just hard to believe that a scrawny kid on antipsychotics could have planned and executed such an event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Autopsy reports are not generally public records unless, for example, they are part of a trial record. Death certificates are. The clerk in Newtown didn&#39;t want to release death certificates because of privacy reasons, but had to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/sandy-hook-elementary-school-massacre-death-certificates-released-article-1.1376084">release them last year because of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit</a>.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists did not look at the facts and then decide that there was something wrong. They decided that it was a &quot;false flag&quot; and then looked for every &quot;discrepancy&quot; they could find, even if they had to make them up.</p>
