<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Autism/cdc2004pediatrics.html">CDC&#39;s statement</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754936">The fraudulent study in question</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4128611/">Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination timing and autism among young african american boys: a reanalysis of CDC data</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The authors of the study did a complete analysis of vaccinated children and their risk of autism, including children without birth certificates…and then much later said, “Oops, guess what? We just realized there are some kids without birth certificates. We’ll have to eliminate them from the study.”</p>

<p>But there’s more. These “kids without birth certificates,” who were dropped from the study, miraculously and accidentally happened to be the ones who showed a much higher risk of autism.</p>

<p>Thompson went public with his confession on August 27th, two days after the CDC posted its press release. So the CDC knew or strongly suspected Thompson was going to go public, and they wanted to head him off at the pass and do a bit of damage control.</p>

<p>Hence, the August 25th CDC press release, which of course tried to defend the scientific validity of the 2004 study.</p>

<p>I’d say there is a strong chance Thompson told his CDC bosses he was going to issue a confession.</p>

<p>Why? Thompson wanted to smooth the waters, keep his job at the CDC, and personally avoid the nasty consequences that would flow from springing a complete surprise on his employers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t even need fake studies, most of the general public are so willing to believe that vacination is like some science gift to man kind that even if vaccintion was causing autism, it&#39;s okay because millions of lives are being saved. Meanwhile back in reality, the government created some kind of wonder land for vaccine makers where they can&#39;t be sued for injuring/killing people with their products. And where the government will lobby on behalf of these companies to make these vaccines mandatory.</p>
