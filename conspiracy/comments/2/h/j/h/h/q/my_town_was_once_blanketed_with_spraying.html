       Being perceptive has its costs.  As does having a high IQ and knowledge of history and its unfortunate propensity to repeat.  Money and credit are worthless.  I digress, have your chemtrails rapidly and inexplicably disappeared?

       Good deal.  I'm honestly perplexed as the cause of why they stopped, decreased this massively.  I first thought it was weaponized weather mod or health weapons.  It seems far deeper and multifaceted.  Thank you for keeping your eyes open.  Upvoted.

       I'm at a loss.  The sprsyers quit?  Redeployed?  Mission accomplished?  Spraying is unnecessary becase no matter what crimes they do, no one stands up?  They've already bankrupt is.  Zionists own out media, politicians, banks, police, corporations, etc.

       Yeah my city in central Canada hasn't sprayed the past 2 days, as far as I Can tell. Went from flat clouds and 24 hour trails to nothing. Now the skies are light blue/ white. I see planes fly by with short trails that disappear, then around an hour later a huge trail pops up out of nowhere

       We may very well be witnessing the end of spraying campaign...if we're lucky.  For all the non-believers, simply look.  Nationwide and continent wide weather matters are definitely NOT to blame.

       Haha definitely not the end of it. Probably just a change in cycles. We're having waay above normal temps for this time of year, and rain in the forecast for the next few days. My guess is that they conjured up this humid storm, 
 Something to do with winter. My guess is after the storm it'll be a full out assault on our ionosphere

       Perform your own when they are spraying chemicals.  In the interim, I'll scan my results.  The best evidence is what you seek for yourself.  Validate or invalidate my results with your own.  A simple sterilized dish and roughgly $100 will net up u your own.  Certain particulates are normal, while others are massively problematic in these quantities.

       Right.  That's why I saw full spraying all dry winter last year.  This is not.a valid excuse.  You lie.  Why?

       I know its not a popular opinion on this site but Im not a chemtrail skeptic. Grew up on too many bases and would see them all of the time. After researching them they seem to be a normal phenomena.

       Im not trying to lie to you or change your mind, and Im not going to engage in a circlejerk. But if you look. At the information. It seems to me. That it is condensation trails.

       They are ABSOLUTELY not normal. The volume alone proves this.  I compare to when I was growing up when contrails disappeared in less than 5 minutes.  Now they linger all day, spreading out into an obscuring poisonous stratua layer.   Completely abnormal to prior behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, setting out tins on clear days, then having a local lab at the university test it has proven definitively the contents being sprayed.  They are NOT normal jet engine emissions. I hope for your and your family sake, you wake up to this readily apparent and personally testable truth.  I don't believe lies I can verify myself.  Nor should you.

       as an uneducated average guy...I go by my senses.....I see planes criss crossing the sky...I see it turn to hazy cloud coverage.... if it was infrequent...I could dismiss it...but it's constant....hardly a week has gone by in the past year I haven't recorded or taken a pic of planes doing this.....what originally got my attention was the fact I watch them do it over what has to be DFW airport airspace.. once I noticed, I started to see it almost daily....there's nothing that looks normal about it to me

       You're absolutely spot on with your views.  The spraying is deliberate, but for some reason, at least here locally, has stopped.  Inexplicably.  This says much.
