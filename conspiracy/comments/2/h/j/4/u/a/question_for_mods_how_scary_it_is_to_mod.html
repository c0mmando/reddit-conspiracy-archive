    <div class="md"><p>You want to hear the scariest story about modding /con?</p>

<p>The thing that bothers me the most.</p>

<p>You might find reference to it with some clever searches.</p>

<p>There was a user that used to be a member of conspiracy <a href="/u/ewolv">/u/ewolv</a> and I was forced to ban him, I wasn&#39;t forced by the admins or the government, I was forced by ethical concerns for his safety and the safety of people around him IRL.</p>

<p>This fellow was legitimately schizophrenic, he has a YouTube channel where he details out the whole fantasy.  He is &quot;King of the CIA&quot; and all these natural disasters that happen are retaliation against him by the CIA who is mad that he is king.  On and on and on.</p>

<p>Well it seems harmless enough right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately the trolls noticed him and latched onto him.  They started inflating his ego and encouraged his insanity by declaring themselves his &quot;disciples&quot;.  They so badly want to associate /con with some horrible event that they are basically pushing this kid&#39;s psychosis to the limit.</p>

<p>To be continued....</p>

<p>You know, haven&#39;t heard much from conspiratard lately, I wonder how much &quot;fun&quot; they&#39;re having in here.</p>

<p>Maybe they&#39;re actually trying to blend in, and they now have their very own coalition of ...wait for it...   ಠ_ಠ    ... Shills!</p>

<p>Idk it&#39;s just odd they kinda went away and nobody really talks about them. Odd but good, anything on that matter is a huge ass distraction of empty arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you wash your hands, anyway?  It&#39;s public information, authorities know about the subreddit and he is medically diagnosed.  Just because some people read and talk about his issues, doesn&#39;t mean that they are automatically guilty.  I do agree, however, that if you pander to his &quot;God persona&quot; fantasies, etc you take a huge risk if he does something down the road.  You obviously wouldn&#39;t want to act as an accomplice or enter into a cult.  That&#39;s the freaky side of things, but a very distinct line.  Most aren&#39;t there for EWOLV and I think many users simple stick around out of curiosity, and would alert authorities if a potentially violent situation is thought to occur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You leave.  You exit the situation.</p>

<p>You may not have bad intentions yourself but the digital king character is using you as a pawn.  He invited you all there to create an illusion for ewolv to feel like his ideas are acceptable and popular even.  </p>

<p>He is literally handling ewolv, you know like a handler...  its glaringly obvious from the initial contact where King was encouraging ewolv to self medicate in <a href="/r/redditassistance">/r/redditassistance</a> where he was buming money to buy his meds.  Real meds, not alcohol and cigarettes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, I would argue it is in my right to read and talk to whoever the fuck I want.  I am surprised you don&#39;t agree.  I disagree that the subreddit is there simply to create and illusion for EWOLV, because most of the people (like 98-99%) don&#39;t believe his story because they know he is simply schizophrenic.  I think DigitalKing is either naive or a handler, so you may be right, and the members could be seen as pawns in the sense that simply their presence is a tool, but they are not pawns in the sense that they are controlled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? The amount of traffic reddit gets, and you think nobody has given a shit?? You see it show up in articles, news stories and day to day interactions among people. This isn&#39;t small business, this is a site that changes people&#39;s opinions because hive minds are great that way. On this sub alone we have upwards of 250,000. If every reddit enthusiast made a pact to get up and march on washington, it&#39;s going to be a media blitz, it&#39;s going to make a difference. And the government pays attention to that shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You leave.  You exit the situation.</p>

<p>You may not have bad intentions yourself but the digital king character is using you as a pawn.  He invited you all there to create an illusion for ewolv to feel like his ideas are acceptable and popular even.  </p>

<p>He is literally handling ewolv, you know like a handler...  its glaringly obvious from the initial contact where King was encouraging ewolv to self medicate in <a href="/r/redditassistance">/r/redditassistance</a> where he was buming money to buy his meds.  Real meds, not alcohol and cigarettes.</p>
