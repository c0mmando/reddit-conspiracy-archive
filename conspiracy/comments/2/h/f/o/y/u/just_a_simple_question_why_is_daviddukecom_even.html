Six hour amateurish documentary of Hitler on the sidebar, links to David fucking Duke&#39;s site all over? WTF. Read some <em>books</em> people, talk to people out in the world, put away the YouTube propagandix. It&#39;s sad and embarrassing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you know why it&#39;s allowed?  Because funnily enough there is a stormfront conspiracy behind it.  For years now they have infiltrated forums that are conspiracy related to push anti-semitism and then full blown white supremacy.</p>

<p>It starts with the NWO being controlled with zionism, which is a popular subject on many conspiracy forums.  From there they move more to the &quot;greater jewish&quot; control over the media.  From there they then get into jewish control over our government, which leads to the whole world being controlled by these evil jews.</p>

<p>After a few months of spamming this &quot;evil jews control everything in this world&quot; they move to holocaust revisionism, which over the past few months has been the slide on this forum recently.  Soon it is full blown neo-nazism, hitler was a nice guy bullshit, jews should be killed bullshit.  Then you will see some &quot;black people commit more crimes&quot; statistics pieces coupled with &quot;government is covering it up!&quot; followed by claims of &quot;i&#39;m not saying anything in particular just posting facts!&quot;  It&#39;s a very obvious take over, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> has had it happen to them too</p>

<p>You guys are getting taken over by neo-nazis, it&#39;s exactly what happened to /pol/ on 4chan</p>

<p>Go look at the people posting the longest speeches and &quot;analysis of facts&quot; in the hitler movie thread.  Then go look at what other subreddits they post in.  George_I_Rockwell is a great example</p>

<p>This is a good chat to you?  Let me explain why David Duke.com isn&#39;t restricted;  because that doesn&#39;t help the free flow of information.   What else should we restrict your highness?  What about links to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I hear that place is a real racism shit hole?  Should we restrict that?  <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> restricted it.</p>

<p>Hmmm maybe we should restrict the ADL&#39;s website? The FBI caught then illegally spying on american citizens.  Let&#39;s make a list!</p>

<p>Or we can keep doing what we do and you can get over it.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t restrict domains.  We don&#39;t censor offensive content.  We do have rules in place to keep the comments from turning into a pit of slurs and insults.</p>

<p>FTFY</p>

<p>Also, judging by the vote counts, looks like your sub really appreciates the censorship. You&#39;re doing great. Keep up the good work. </p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;m not in favor of censoring or removing the DavidDuke material. I don&#39;t see any reason why the community can&#39;t discuss it openly. However, putting a pro-Hitler documentary (one of extremely questionable historic merit) on the sidebar forces anyone who subs here to tacitly approve racism, because that&#39;s what the mods are doing. It&#39;s taking it out of the conversation, and making it a part of the theme. That&#39;s horseshit, and it&#39;s glaring evidence that this sub <em>is actually racist</em>.</p>

<p>EDIT: Yep, banned. <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> would rather censor than defend his position. Confirmed fascist. </p>

<p>This is not a normal confrontation.  You know pope, I was fine with being &quot;confronted&quot; about this domain issue until the guy starts gearing up to frame me as a eugenicist, and then I warned him.  You&#39;re making a mountain out of a mole hill.</p>

<p>At the end of the day this is just another attempt to restrict domains.  We haven&#39;t done it yet and we aren&#39;t going to start.</p>

<p>Youre not wrong, banning domains can lead to a slippery slope but you handled it in an immature way. You do see the irony though in saying there will be no restriction in domains but do not challenge that rule or you will be banned?</p>

<p>As a user you are fine, as a moderator of controversial sub you need to get thicker skin and moderate, not assault the very users that make your job necesary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I can see how you interpreted it that way.</p>

<p>I was warning the user to stop with the personal attacks.  Like his eugenics comment. He is trying to say that I must agree with David duke&#39;s  eugenics opinions since I won&#39;t restrict the domain.</p>

<p>That is not a debate, that is mud slinging nonsense.  </p>

<p>And in truth, there is no debate to be had about banning a domain from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  We have this debate pop up every time there is some meta drama bomb about a racists link.  We simply are not going to consider banning domains.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the same reason why I removed the post.  There is no need to debate it because it will never happen.  We will not ban domains.</p>

Specifically, I was asking you to clarify the difference in a position that says &quot;I&#39;m OK with censorship as long as I&#39;m the censor&quot; and a position that says &quot;I&#39;m OK with Eugenics, as long as I make the selection. </p>

<p>Considering that we were talking about David Duke and a Hitler documentary (which, again, I don&#39;t think is problem being discussed on this sub, but the sidebar is a little much...), it seemed like a very topical comparison to make. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry you feel that way.</p>

<p>Just because something is posted here and I won&#39;t delete it, doesn&#39;t mean that I agree with it.  It just means I&#39;m not going to delete it.</p>

<p>Likewise, just because I delete something because its a meme or a tired meta post, doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t agree with it.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t appreciate when the community turns on people for an idea or a post when the reason they enjoy this community in the first place is because its a refuge for them, from getting treated the exact same way elsewhere on reddit.</p>

<p>It actually sickens me, the attempts by regulars here to silence one of their own.  So for what its worth I apologize for my behavior yesterday but I simultaneously stand by the actions i took.  </p>

<p>No one complains when I ban a troll from conspiratard for calling everyone here retards because they are talking about 9-11, but when regulars here start calling everyone Nazi racists and they get banned, then suddenly we want the rules suspended long enough to get away with it.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t have it both ways, one set of rules for us, the same set of rules for everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because hating David Duke and getting pissed when a post about hating David Duke gets removed makes me a shit-stirrer and pro-censorship.</p>

<p>Look, you can&#39;t say &quot;NO CENSORSHIP&quot; then remove content where people initiate discussion about our declining level of discourse.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m bothering - it looks like you didn&#39;t read anything I wrote in this thread (or care about it), you&#39;re just reacting because you saw the word &quot;woman&quot; in an argument with a mod. Which is fine, I guess, because it gave you one more person to call a cunt  and a &quot;social justice warrior,&quot; so maybe the illusory power you feel here will make you nicer to the people in your real life today. </p>

<p>I mean, you get to insult a female <em>and</em> stick your nose up a mod&#39;s ass...and it&#39;s <em>Friday</em>...so...today&#39;s just a big bucket of winner winner chicken dinner for you, it appears!</p>

Now the hypocrisy continues as you personally attack me while saying me &quot;personally attacking&quot; others discredits what I say. </p>

<p>But honestly this community is pathetic with this issue. The community controls the content. They don&#39;t vote which allows shit posts and hitler to win.

    <div class="md"><p>But the point is that a mod shouldn&#39;t be deleting content that personally offends him, <em>especially</em> while pledging to keep content that doesn&#39;t offend him in the name of being anti-censorship. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to ban davidduke links, but I do I want to exercise my right to downvote them and upvote people who bring up Duke&#39;s history. Everyone should feel free to comment or post about what they see wrong with those links without fear of being banned from the sub or having their content censored (in this case, this is especially important so poor newbs don&#39;t forward davidduke.com links to their families and look like crazy racists when all they were trying to do was share some conspiracy content unrelated to racism).</p>

<p>That&#39;s how this community should be run. Post things, let&#39;s discuss them. Don&#39;t post something controversial, then go on a rampage deleting posts that that bring up issues about them and ban people who call you on being hypocritical.</p>

<p>I really think there&#39;s a concerted effort going on to discredit this sub (especially given the timing - there was a really kickass AskReddit thread a few days ago that plugged this sub, and then they pop in and it was turned into White Rights overnight--you can complain about the community not controlling the content, but a lot of the community don&#39;t have time to manage RedditBots and vote brigades and etc to combat the attacks we get in here). The whole devolution this week really bums me out because I like it here. I hope we can all figure it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did he delete posts that were solely about David duke in a negative light? I thought he only deleted posts asking for censorship. If he did the former then my opinion is different. I thought it was just some circular shit stirring he wanted to nip in the bud. But the former definitely makes him wrong and a hypocritic.</p>

<p>I agree that conspiracy has some shit going in within but I look at this whole pc/sjw movement as a way of censorship and to discredit people. I think censoring stuff would help but it&#39;s a slippery slope and putting a bandaid on the leak. Organic voting is the best way but it&#39;s also the most difficult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the pc/sjw movement, anyway? I mean, how is saying &quot;David Duke is a racist and I don&#39;t like him&quot; a bad thing? How is that censorship? If you wear a stupid hat and look ridiculous, am I not supposed to say, &quot;Hey, man - that hat is hilariously terrible, you should <em>not</em> wear that out.&quot; You are free to say &quot;I like this hat, wearing it anyway!&quot;</p>

<p>I should be able to share my opinion without being censored because some guys are scared of women and Black and Jewish people (why? I still don&#39;t get this; you live and work with these people, what&#39;s there to fear?). </p>

<p>You guys bitch and moan about Feminists all day long on the Internets, and we put up with it. You called me a &quot;delusional cunt&quot; upthread. I dealt with it. Can you young men&#39;s precious ears not stand to hear that people think racism is stupid and sexism is lame? That both attitudes present as weakness to a lot of us out there in the world? That offends you, so you want to shut it down completely? </p>

<p>There&#39;s such a weird mentality coming out of this &quot;RedPill&quot;/&quot;GamerGate&quot; thing - I think a lot of people are being led around by the nose. But for what purpose besides societal division? - That&#39;s what I&#39;m really trying to figure out, but I haven&#39;t figured it out yet. But know that the bitchy sexism and racism in the &quot;Anti-SJW&quot; set looks a lot like weakness to the outside world. </p>

<p>If I were you, I wouldn&#39;t wear that beret to the party - but you&#39;re free to do so if you like. But I&#39;m absolutely allowed to tell you I think the hat looks weak and I&#39;d choose the fedora instead (no slight intended--I love fedoras and they&#39;re being unfairly maligned by the Internet).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want him censored - but I also don&#39;t want posts like this censored. People should know who David Duke is.</p>

<p>Look at it this way - there are a lot of us who lived through that time and some of us who&#39;ve even known the guy - and have an association. Some youngster finds a perfectly reasonable conspiracy story on davidduke.com and forwards it out to a friend or loved one to read.</p>

<p>That person sees davidduke.com and all of a sudden both the sender and the content are tainted in their mind. The kid didn&#39;t know, the kid didn&#39;t grow up in that time, but the kid and the content are now covered in Duke-taint.</p>

<p>People should <em>absolutely</em> know and understand who David Duke is and what kind of reaction they may get out of friends and family for forwarding a davidduke.com link to them. </p>

<p>Censoring posts like this that bring up this issue do a serious disservice to neophyte critical thinkers who might want to spread a story to friends and family, not realizing the weighted racism inherent in a fucking davidduke.com URL. (I have heard of people accidentally sending links to their black friends, who never look at them the same way again.)</p>
