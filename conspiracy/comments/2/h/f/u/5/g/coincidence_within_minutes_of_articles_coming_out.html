       Search google news for "eric holder marijuana", the vox.com article is especially well written. Check the timestamps of when those were published vs. when his resignation was announced. Coincidence, or an attempt to drown out the news cycle so his Katie Couric interview gets buried?

       No.  The more likely conspiracy has to do with the Fast and Furious scandal which Holder has been obfuscating for years.  Today a judge ruled,

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        U.S. District Court Judge John D. Bates has denied a request from the Department of Justice to delay the release of a list of Operation Fast and Furious documents being protected under President Obama's assertion of executive privilege.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Obama used "executive privilege", which isn't even a thing, to declare Holder didn't have to comply with Congressional investigations.  A President has the power to pardon criminals, but what Obama did was basically obstruct an investigation which would prove Holder (and maybe others) was a criminal.

       It's often claimed that this policy is a fraud, but when you look into it, the evidence turns out to be "businesses
       <em>
        that say they were legitimate
       </em>
       were raided." And then you dig through a dozen articles that repeat these claims, and find the one article that explains actually they were selling a hundred times the allowed quantity to people who didn't have their medical cards from out-of-state, etc.

       My thinking is less that this got him booted, but moreso they were going to announce it anyway and did it in a Thursday AM instead of late Friday afternoon as is usual for negative press releases. If they waited until Friday when the marijuana story was already in the news cycle, that would give the drug scheduling debate more air time as the two stories would inevitably be connected by the media even if completely unrelated.

       OK, so you think that the administration is ideologically
       <em>
        opposed
       </em>
       to cannabis rescheduling, but is terrified that its position is
       <em>
        more politically risky
       </em>
       than allowing rescheduling to go forwards, and so is trying to suppress discussion of a change. This is nuts.

       This may have something to do with why this sub is under attack and why bogus stories have been trending on the internet in the past few days.  I've seen this before.  They create a cloud of bull before the reveal so that by the time it happens you won't know what's what.

       The AG is stepping down is a huge deal, and not just because of marijuana.  This changes what the political agenda will be for the coming months.  This has the potential to stall pending legislation and prosecutions.

       Holder is a treasonous felon that as still remains unpunished.  As if he AND Obama had no idea about gunrunner.  It's criminal and the heads are ultimately for these crimes against humanity.

        Coincidence, or an attempt to drown out the news cycle so his Katie Couric interview gets buried?

       Neither of these explanations make a lot of sense. Holder has been in for six years, and (despite ramblings of conservative media) is not a liability for the administration. There is every reason to assume that he simply wanted to leave the job, and that his departure was contemplated for months, as the administration is saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is the relationship between his resignation and his views on MJ?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Being on the way out, Holder feels less bound by the need to support Administration policy, and can give voice to his personal views more freely.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Being on the way out, Holder is a good candidate to raise a trial balloon for the White House on a contemplated change in policy, from which they can distance themselves if there is a strongly negative reaction.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I think the second one is more likely. But either way, you are confusing the completely normal operation of politics for some kind of behind the scenes puppet show.
