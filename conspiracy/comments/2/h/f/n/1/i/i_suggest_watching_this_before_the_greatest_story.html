    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s long, so I&#39;ll give a little info about the doc. Bill Still is the narrator and creator of this documentary. It is meant to give the history of paper money.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Talks about history of paper money. From Ancient Rome until the 20th century. </p></li>
<li><p>How interest came to be. Introduces the story of the Bauers (Rothchilds) and how they manipulated the bond market during Napoleons defeat at Waterloo. This family had five sons who went to the major cities in Europe to open up banks and then lend money to the Governments there, as governments always pay their debts. Fool proof. 
During this time, the Rothchilds in England and France financed both sides of the war. Finance both sides as to get the spoils from whoever wins and then enslave the loser and make them pay for all war reparations, see Germany after WW1. </p></li>
<li><p>Explains the First Bank and Second Bank of the US. These were Central banks that lent money to the government at interest. The first bank had a 20 year charter starting in 1791. The charter was not renewed in 1811, thus the start of the War of 1812.  Andrew Jackson defeated the Second Banks charter in the 1830&#39;s and then proceeded to pay off the national debt, this was the only time in US history the debt was paid in full. He was almost assassinated, but both revolvers misfired. I personally think the banksters were in charge of the hit, as they weren&#39;t lending money at interest. No interest, no money to be made for free. </p></li>
<li><p>Abe Lincoln created his own currency and printed it, interest free. This meant they were Units of Value, and not instant Units of Debt. This was after he went to the lenders to ask for financing, but they wanted 24-36% interest rates. He printed about 450,000,000 greenbacks worth of currency. He created the money for free, without interest, as already said. The banksters had no hands in the money lending, which meant no interest, or free money, to be made. Abe Lincoln was assassinated in 1865. </p></li>
<li><p>James Garfield was elected president and spoke out against the money changers/money lenders/banksters, the ones who lent out money at interest. He slammed them saying </p></li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce... and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not 
have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.&quot; 
He was assassinated a few weeks later. I too believe the banksters put the hit out on him. </p>

<ol>
<li>Federal Reserve is created, a private entity that holds the power to print money, buy treasury bonds and then lend money out at interest. Gold is confiscated in the 1930&#39;s by FDR&#39;s government. People were forced to sell for 20 dollars an ounce. As soon as the gold was collected, the price shot up to 35 dollars an ounce. Hmm. </li>
</ol>

<p>This conspiracy is mother of all other conspiracies. The reason why Hitler hated the Jews so much is because they were the Money Masters, more or less. Hundreds of years ago, it was illegal to lend out money at interest, but the Jews could. They found that in the old testament it said, basically, &quot;Thou shall not lend money at interest to fellow brothers&quot;. So what did they do? Lent it to non jews. Well that takes care of that. Loophole. 
Blah, blah, I digress. Just watch and enjoy the conspiracy of all conspiracies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you see is what you get with Bill Still. His youtube channel reeks of the 1980&#39;s. But, its all worth a look. If I were to see this doc in college, I would have fallen asleep. It is dated, but surely worth a look. I hope you can give it another chance. Oz is great, but it is basically the same thing, only it has less history and Bill aged a bit, haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope people realize that there&#39;s <em>a lot</em> that&#39;s not true in both of these movies. Don&#39;t believe everything you here. I haven&#39;t watched the whole Hitler movie, but I have watched and researched <em>The Money Masters</em> and there&#39;s tons of wrong stuff in it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Talks about history of paper money. From Ancient Rome until the 20th century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have tried to find any information that would support or contradict
what the movie says about money in Rome, but I haven&#39;t been able to find
much online. There are no sources given in the movie for this.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one thing that&#39;s clearly wrong, though. Still says &quot;With the
demise of plentiful money and the loss of their property, the masses
lost confidence in Roman government and refused to support it. Rome
plunged into the gloom of the Dark Ages.&quot;</p>

<p>After Caesar died, Rome became the most prosperous and powerful country.
It was that way for hundreds of years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>

<p>as governments always pay their debts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_debt_crises">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_debt_crises</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explains the First Bank and Second Bank of the US. These were Central banks that lent money to the government at interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anybody that lends the government money gets interest, and mostly the government borrowed from sources other than the First and Second Bank. Both banks were created to <em>help the United States pay off war debt</em>. They were very successful at that.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/xjEZt">CLICK HERE FOR IMPORTANT GRAPHS ABOUT GOVERNMENT DEBT DURING THE TIMES OF THE FIRST AND SECOND BANKS OF THE UNITED STATES.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The charter was not renewed in 1811, thus the start of the War of 1812.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s very well documented that the U.S. declared war on Britain for
reasons that have nothing to do with banks. This section is an outright
lie.</p>

<p>The movie states: &quot;Some writers have even claimed that Nathan Rothschild warned that the United States would find itself involved in a most disastrous war if the Bank’s charter were not renewed. ...  Within 5 months, England attacked the U.S. and the War of 1812 was on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some writers&quot; were hoax creators in the late 20th century. Of course he
doesn&#39;t say who &quot;some writers&quot; are because they certainly aren&#39;t
historians. This is a complete fabrication. The U.S. started the war,
not Britain, and Rothschild never said anything like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Andrew Jackson defeated the Second Banks charter in the 1830&#39;s and then proceeded to pay off the national debt, this was the only time in US history the debt was paid in full.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The debt was paid off <em>while the Second Bank of the U.S. existed</em>, and
most of it was paid off <em>before Andrew Jackson came to office in 1829.</em>
See <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xjEZt">the graphs linked above</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was almost assassinated, but both revolvers misfired. I personally think the banksters were in charge of the hit, as they weren&#39;t lending money at interest. No interest, no money to be made for free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you read about the trial of the assassin or the findings of the
congressional investigation into the assination? Jackson didn&#39;t suspect
bankers had anything to do with it, and the investigation found that no
one but the lunatic Richard Lawrence had anything to do with the
attempted assassination.</p>

<p>But, if you want to believe in something without evidence, I guess
that&#39;s your right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abe Lincoln created his own currency and printed it, interest free. This meant they were Units of Value, and not instant Units of Debt. This was after he went to the lenders to ask for financing, but they wanted 24-36% interest rates. He printed about 450,000,000 greenbacks worth of currency. He created the money for free, without interest, as already said. The banksters had no hands in the money lending, which meant no interest, or free money, to be made. Abe Lincoln was assassinated in 1865.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This section of the movie repeats many historical myths, including a
bogus quote from Bismarck, the Dick Taylor hoax, a bogus quote from
Lincoln (&quot; ...  Money will cease to be master and become the servant of
humanity&quot;), a bogus quote from the London <em>Times</em>, the hoax letter from
Ikleheimer et al. to the Rothschild Brother, the Russian fleet myth,
another bogus Lincoln quote (&quot;the money power preys upon the nation
...&quot;), the hoax regret from Salmon Chase, and more.</p>

<p>The movie claims that &quot;Lincoln would surely have killed the National
Banks’ money monopoly extracted from him during the war.&quot; In reality,
Lincoln was a reluctant and apologetc supporter of Greenbacks, and
favored the National Bank Act. There&#39;s no evidence, except fabricated
quotes, that Lincoln would have supported expansion of Greenbacks. He
was well aware of the inflation they created.</p>

<p>The movie presents Gerald McGeer&#39;s theory about bankers killing Lincoln.
It says &quot;McGeer had obtained evidence deleted from the public record,&quot;
but doesn&#39;t say that it had been deleted because the witnesses recanted
it and pled guilty to perjury chargers. Even if you think that the
evidence was true despite that, McGeer never presented evidence that any
banker was involved. His whole case amounts to (1) John Wilkes Booth
said he could get a lot of money, (2) bankers were the only people who
had any money (really?), and (3) bankers hated Lincoln. That&#39;s it. No
evidence that any banker had anything to do with the assassination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Garfield was elected president and spoke out against the money changers/money lenders/banksters, the ones who lent out money at interest. He slammed them saying ..  &quot;Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce... and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.&quot; He was assassinated a few weeks later. I too believe the banksters put the hit out on him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Garfield actually said was in Congress, before he ran for the
presidency, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=u-goAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false">speaking against a
proposal for the government to print
money:</a>
&quot;It would convert the Treasury of the United States into a manufactory of paper money. It makes the House of Representatives and the Senate, or the caucus of the party which happens to be in the majority, <em>the absolute dictator of the financial and business affairs of this country.</em> This scheme surpasses all the centralism and all the Caesarism that were ever charged upon the Republican party in the wildest days of the war or in the events growing out of the war.&quot; </p>

<p>This was paraphrased during the late 19th  century as &quot;Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.&quot;</p>

<p>The last part of the quote &quot;... and when you realize that the entire
system is very easily controlled...&quot; is not from Garfield. I can&#39;t find
it anywhere before the movie <em>The Money Masters.</em></p>

<p>So, in reality, Garfield was speaking against <em>the government</em> printing money. He was a hard-money Republican and very close to financial interests. It is laughable to present him as an opponent of banks.</p>

<p>There are plenty of more falsehoods in this movie. I&#39;ve barely scratched the surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that really gets me is the whole interest thing, as it pertains to governments. Why is it that governments need central banks to give them money, when it fact they (Central Banks) have nothing in their reserves to cover it? Why can&#39;t governments just print their own currency, interest free, and cover their expenses not at the expense of the tax payers, us. ? What gives central banks ultimate power? Why do they have the right to print money? Why do they collect interest from nothing? Each government should be able to print their own currency. Give me Units of Value, rather than Units of Debt. Its not hard to connect the dots of history to realize that Central banks do more harm than good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Governments can finance their spending by a combination of taxation, borrowing, and printing money. Taxation is not very popular. Borrowing leads to debt and interest, and printing money leads to inflation, sometimes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation">disastrously so.</a></p>

<p>Note that hyperinflations have happened <em>many times</em>. It happened <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_American_currency#Continental_currency">in America during the Revolutionary War</a>, which is a main reason that the U.S. Constitution prohibited state governments from creating legal tender paper money and the federal government was not given the power to create paper money.</p>

<p>Even when there isn&#39;t hyperinflation, the new money still creates inflation, which is like a tax on everybody.</p>

<p>Just printing money to pay the government&#39;s bills is considered a desperation measure. For normal operations, the alternatives are taxes or borrowing. Governments don&#39;t have to borrow from the central bank and mostly they don&#39;t. Historically the Federal Reserve only buys 10 to 15 percent of the national debt. The other 85-90% comes from private individuals, corporations, retirement funds, foreign governments and others.</p>

<p>I calculated that from the years 1947 to 2008, the Federal Reserve only received 2% of the <em>net</em> interest on the debt, since they give back almost all their profits to the federal government. Since 2008, they&#39;ve actually given so much money to the federal government that it&#39;s more than all the interest that the Fed received for the previous 60 years!</p>

<p>The main reason that central banks are somewhat independent of their government is to cushion them from the political pressure to buy <em>more</em> of the debt and save the government money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its very simple! People tend to confuse personal loan interest with interest-bearing currency.

    <div class="md"><p>When you think about it, just from an objective, abstracted point of view, the concept of paper money is insane. What? We&#39;re going to trust other people when they say we should trade our goods or exchange our labor for little pieces of paper? It&#39;s crazy. When have we ever been able to trust the government about anything? For countless centuries money was disks of precious metals that had intrinsic value. You exchanged goods for a silver coin because the silver coin itself had value. Even if you pounded it int a ball with a hammer, it still had the same value. But a piece of paper? That&#39;s intrinsically worthless. It&#39;s magic paper. The only way it has value is if you close your eyes and pretend that it has value. And you have to hope that everyone else is closing their eyes and pretanding along with you, because if they aren&#39;t, the whole crazy system falls apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Its essentially worthless. But it does work, obviously, just not very well! Debt free money puts value on people&#39;s time and labor. It makes it a Unit of Value, instead of a Unit of Debt. It is essentially what Hitler did, and Germany boomed. </p>
