      <p>
       I recently visited Auschwitz.  I expected it to be a "secret" isolated location, but in reality it is an hour out of Krakow (large city) and in the middle of largest industrial area of Poland.  In WWII the region was a large forced labor operation with 45 satellite camps. Only two locations were alleged to have gas chambers and on the tour the first is now downplayed as a killing site.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two gas chambers where 900,000 (number keeps getting revised down) were allegedly killed were located in a large residence area called Auschwitz IIâ€“Birkenau.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allegedly trains pulled in right in the middle of this residence camp and people were marched about 500 yards down the middle in full view of the barrack city to the chambers. As I made the walk myself I asked the tour guide how many people in the barracks witnessed the march of death, and he answered "very few as they were out working".
      </p>
      <p>
       I also asked the guide about human remains, teeth, burial sites and he said the Germans were very through at disposal, so very little has been found. My thought on this: teeth are hard to burn, do the math on 900,000 folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chambers themselves are now mostly rubble, but were located in plain view next to a soccer field and barracks. The design and location of the "gassing" facility could just have easily been a delousing area. The guide couldn't tell me where inmates were actually deloused but I assume it would have to be a good sized facility.
      </p>
      <p>
       To my eyes on the ground this site seemed like one of the oddest places I could ever imagine to gas, burn and completely dispose of 900,000 people over a year and a half.  I suppose it could be done somewhere in this large industrial region, but in a much more secluded location, away from barracks, recreation fields and using more efficient equipment.  There was even a cooking kitchen facility within close sight of the chambers. Really?
At Birkenau I the gas chamber is located about half a block from the camp commandant and his family's residence and abutted next to inmate barracks. Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also roughly 500,000 of the alleged Birkenau victims were Hungarian Jews brought in during the summer and fall of 1944.  At Auschwitz there is a chart showing Jews in different countries, and Hungary showed an estimated 600,000. This would have been quite the operation considering that the Germans were severely lacking in rolling rail stock at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an account of 75,000 Hungarian Jews marched through Vienna and to Germany in the summer of 1944 to work in critical armaments factories.    So the question begs, walk the workers, but send death targets by rail over the Carpathian mountains to Poland? To make the Auschwitz math work, you have to include the Hungarian cohort and it doesn't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also numerous documentation that tens of thousands able bodied Hungarian Jews were mobilized to build fortifications in eastern Hungary and Slovakia. You can listen to interviews from these people in the Shoah Institute material. One said his Jewish sister was killed in an allied air raid in Budapest.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to say Jews didn't suffer. Although Auschwitz- Birkenau I barracks looked normal,  Auschwitz II didn't look like any picnic. I was surprised at how exposed it seemed to the elements. I was there on a cold, rainy summer's day, and no thank you. The stoves in the crowded barracks looked pretty rudimentary.  In late 1944-1945, conditions throughout the German occupied areas deteriorated and many people in these camps (and outside of the camps) died of diseases and bad conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also visited a huge camp cemetery in Theresienstadt in Bohemia, Czech Republic.  There are thousands buried there of all denominations. On the graves about half had the Star of David. The dates were mostly March to June, 1945. The cause of death was an epidemic. People were still dying AFTER the camp was liberated.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be argued that Jews in particular were at the bottom of the list for scarce rations and supplies during that late war period. Many were taken on long marches and there are reports of reprisals. There are good historical accounts of mass shootings in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is real history there but Jewish historians won't dis-intern the sites and do modern forensic investigations? Why? Many workers in the East also escaped to the advancing Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that many Jews (including Anne Frank) died as conditions in occupied lands fell apart. Even larger numbers of Germans died. The overall conditions in Europe in 1945 is the real story here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emaciated bodies one sees in films were typhus victims. Even those spinning the gassing story state that stopped in November, 1944, and acknowledge that almost all gas was used in Poland, not in Germany.  That is fundamental for all historians on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is most perplexing is that a conversation like this one in Europe is against the law. People go to jail having it.  History always is revised over time, is part of the process, but apparently not this debate or this history.

       What do I need to know about this film? That camp commandant Hoess was tortured and nearly beaten to death to extract his "confession". Not even Holocaust historians take this at face value.

       No trace of the remains? What about the huge fucking mass graves discovered at many Nazi concentration camps?
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously though, when you cremate someone their teeth don't get left behind. They get turned to ash.  Even though they don't usually burn fully, they are then ground down to a powder after being dramatically weakened during the cremation itself. That's why cremation urns are just full of ash, not ash and teeth.

       Don't bother arguing with these idiots. They watch a video or read a blog and then they are experts. It's sad that anyone would bother refuting something so proven but here we are. I would like to see if one of these assholes would stand in front of my family and tell them their relatives weren't wiped about because of this.

       Why are you confused about the lack of remains?  They
       <em>
        cremated
       </em>
       all (most) of the bodies.  After cremation teeth are generally ground down into a fine powder, with whatever else doesn't burn.  Though the teeth don't burn completely on their own, they ARE significantly weakened, which allows the grinding to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, many of the remains of people killed in the holocaust were buried in mass graves, the locations of which are known.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I don't know why I even bothered typing this out. If you aren't already convinced by the
       <em>
        tremendous
       </em>
       body of evidence that exists confirming that the holocaust occurred more or less as the historical consensus indicates, you won't be convinced by some random schmuck on Reddit.

       What machines did they use to grind up these 32teethpermouthx6millionJews=192 million teeth. The official story is that the Nazis ground them with hammers, which seems pretty difficult to grind that many teeth in under 2 years. The deniars simply see some impossibilities in the official story, which I can't explain either so can't really blame them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument on the "denier" side is that the death counts were  exaggerated because it
       <em>
        needed
       </em>
       to be 6 million in order to fill biblical prophesy. There is
       <strong>
        no one ive ever seen
       </strong>
       actually denying the holocaust happened.

       The Weasel backed the wrong horse. He chose to write about the fire-pit story, which was more popular in the years immediately following the war than the gas chamber story. Needless to say, he never saw a fire-pit and he never saw a gas chamber.

       to ask for a review of your shadowban.

       The alleged gas chambers at crematoria II and III are listed as
       <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/camps/auschwitz/images/k2-constr-plans-0932.jpg">
        morgues in the blueprints
       </a>
       , the design of these chambers does not suggest mass executions were occurring virtually non stop. I have visited Auschwitz as well, and it definitely seemed like a shitty place to have been sent to. Many people died there, so regardless of one's perspective on Holocaust revisionism, it is still a solemn sight.

       in Britain circa 1980s three million Jews and three million others was the accepted UK MSM/school number of people who died in camps.

       today the US figure is six million Jews and x other.

       a true story is a better thing than a fable, pushing a fable just brings the whole history into disrespect. the average person in the street upon hearing that X is a lie will assume everything is a lie.

       The "Six Million Jews" quote was taken out of a Torah "prophesy".  It has been published in thousands of articles and books over the years, at least four decades prior to the events of WWII, directly undermining and betraying the notion that 6,000,000 Jews perished in Europe between 1939-1945, as Jews have claimed.

       No, the 6,000,000 that is referenced in almost all of those articles was the estimated population of Jews in Russia around the time of World War I.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the
       <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-GQ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA17&amp;amp;dq=%22Russian+Empire%22">
        1915 World Almanac, p.  17
       </a>
       , "There are 18,277,542 Jews in the world, 9,988,197 in Europe, 3,083,674 in America. The Russian Empire leads by far all the nations with 6,060,415."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a population estimate, not a prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did a search on the ProQuest Historical Newspapers database to see if the number 6,000,000 was sepcial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Searching for '("6,000,000 jews" OR "6 million jews" OR "six million jews") AND (danger OR famine OR dying OR massacre OR starving)' I find 44 articles in the years 1915-1938 (the years mentioned in the video).  Of those, 39 are in the years 1915 to 1921, during World War I and the

       Here is an extremely long winded, twist and turn explanation of body disposal by a Holocaust historian.  I have read it, but it never really answered the question other than to imply "that the Germans were very devoted to eradicating evidence and bodies."  Perhaps this "Nazi total efficiency and dedication to covering up the crime scene" answers your question, but it doesn't really answer mine.

       The historian also uses the term "denier" a lot. I don't think any revisionist historians I am aware of "denies" that crimes were committed. I certainly don't,  and think dragging people from their homes and neglecting  medical and safety/welfare requirements is a crime as is shooting them.   The question is how, how many and by what methods.  In otherwords what's the real history?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if people want to use the term "holocaust" to describe whatever really did happen, that's OK by me. I am not here to debate a word.

       The term "Holocaust" (with a capital H) is a wholly Jewish term, even though the word itself is Greek in its root. The term was around for decades before WW2 in the Jewish community as part of a prophecy that said that six million Jews must die before Jews could return to Jerusalem. Holocaust means an offering to God that is wholly consumed by fire. Hence the importance of the crematoria in the modern Holocaust legend. The bodies of the dead Jews were the offering to God, and they were "wholly consumed by fire" in the crematoria. That's why the assertion that the bodies were burnt to fine ash and disposed of in the wind, or in a river, or whatever, is so central to the Holocaust legend. Unless the corpses were wholly burnt, they were not a true offering to God.

       I think the most important point to grasp about the "Holocaust" is that it is merely a term applied by Jews to events in WW2 that they were able to manipulate, lie about, and twist to suit their sacrifice of six million prophecy. It is a made-up thing -- the Holocaust as a traveling circus, I mean. Individual events shoved under the umbrella term "Holocaust" may be real (or may not) but the Holocaust as a whole, integrated complex is a modern myth.

       As for the term "denier" -- it's just silly. Nobody denies all of the events Jews claim happened in WW2. Nobody denies there were concentration camps, or that large groups of Jews were sometimes shot. Nobody claims that Jews didn't die of starvation and disease in the camps. So what are these so-called "deniers" actually denying? They are denying the unified mythology of the Holocaust, and questionable events that are classified as Holocaust events.

       Most Jews call it the Shoah. Holocaust is an English word.

       I read somewhere that after cremating the bodies, they took hammers to the teeth

       But do you see how silly that is? It's an attempt to explain away a question that is not answered by the existing dogma. Teeth often don't burn in cremations -- so where are the millions of teeth? Well, the Nazi soldiers sat down at anvils with little hammers, and they popped those ninety million teeth one by one, pop-pop-pop. Then they carried away the tooth dust and hid it. Can't anyone see how fucking insane that is?

       Yes, Hasbara was a little slow on the uptake, as the post had a pretty good run. Their hands must be full, busy with too many other projects.
