       Not a hundred percent aware of anonymous, have looked into. Some people say freedom fighters, some say they have been infiltrated by government. My thought is this, may seem random and far fetched. But, so with the latest ISIL beheadings, that we know are fake as shit. The anon message is a message of faceless (headless) people joining a cause. Could this be a coincidence? I'm not a troll, I've been around for a while. I purge accounts and recreate from the ashes. Idk, I just watched this video:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1U01Wifs9ig">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1U01Wifs9ig

       from : np.reddit.com

        /r/conspiracy/comments/2htseu/anonymous_haarpscalar_warning/
       </a>
       and I just got a weird feeling in my gut. With all that is happening, I think the intelligence agencies are in on it. Could they be behind Annon? 4chan is dead, some speculate it was a psy-ops with the whole Quinnspiracy and fappening. They are pinning people up against others. The missing head really troubles me these days, because TPTB are all spouting off about the beheading of x allies/citizens. Is it all a ploy, hiding in plain site? Shit, just got out of the shower and have had a few beers. Would love to hear your thoughts. Maybe we could hash out some things from this, thought. lol. Thanks mates!

       We are on the verge of another censoring of the internet.
Every few years they advance it a little bit more. Any free thought social sites are the target now. It only goes downhill.

       When google bought Blogger they revamped Blogger and deleted a lot of links.

       That's not the proper question. The real question is
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       should we believe they are
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       ? Things in the universe do not simply "occur" until proven they did not, it's the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the West is trying to use these videos as justification for intervention, why should we buy it at face value? We've already been burned numerous times by the BS they'll throw out there to start a
       <del>
        war
       </del>
       conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's ISIS/L trying to show how "badass" they are, maybe they should try harder and not cop out with a lame fade to black. If you're
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       much of a badass then let's see it. Lord knows how many far more realistic and gruesome beheading videos exist on the internet, this is child's play.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, why in the world would we believe these videos as being real? Just because someone made them? I guess every Hollywood movie is non-fiction too then.

       And this is the card that gets pulled. every. single. time. Questioning any gruesome event and you get called a sick-o.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the deal. You and I will sit at home doing what we normally do for the next year or two. Whether we bomb ISIS/L, go back to Afghanistan/Iraq, destroy Syria/Iran, or whatever our next target is...
       <strong>
        we
       </strong>
       will remain relatively unaffected.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what about those hundreds of thousands, even millions, of innocents who have their family members killed. Their houses destroyed. Their lives ruined. Don't even try to deny it, the Iraqis will gladly show you the aftermath of people who were not involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then the billions upon billions of tax-payer dollars that will go to waste destroying these people, instead of going towards a one-payer Healthcare system. Not going to our infrastructure, our education, or our own economy. Nope, all of that going into the military industrial complex so we can blow up our new boogeyman.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I want some damn solid evidence that this conflict is worth it. If that takes me analyzing a beheading so that all this other bullshit can be avoided, I'll gladly do it.

       There have been numerous experts (not that it takes one) that have called foul on these videos. There's a whole bunch of things that don't line up, from the accents.. the green-screening, the fade out, it goes on and on.

       I have as much proof that this is fake as you do it is real. We cancel out, and that's fine. However, that doesn't prove it's real. Things are not true unless proven otherwise, that's simply not how reality works.

       Because, after watching all the videos, I never saw a beheading. I saw what could've been a beheading but never showed it. I've seen other videos (unfortunately) and they show start to finish. ISIL is the baddies on the block, for them not to show what the Sinaloa shows, let a lone actual AQ and Al-Nusra, proves to me its fake.

       There's the fact that the dude's throat got slashed 7 times without any blood?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're being counter-intuitive. If something happened, the onus of proof is on the party claiming it happened. You're implying that the beheading(s) happened. The burden is on you. From the videos that everybody is aware of - there is no evidence of a beheading - they all censor that part out (unlike countless
       <strong>
        real
       </strong>
       beheading videos from the last 10 years). That coupled with shady announcements by UK govt warning that viewing the video can constitute terrorism, the strange announcement by LiveLeak changing their long-held policy (since Ogrish days) on what videos they're willing to host, mainstream journals discussing the possibility that this was a hoax, the fact that the original video was outed by the organization
       <strong>
        known
       </strong>
       for providing the first fake Osama tape, etc. etc. etc.

       Touche, there is no actual evidence within the videos, so providing evidence of said video seems pretty hard. Maybe they should release the full video?
      </p>
      <p>
       PS. I'm all for the propaganda video of ISIL, but it makes zero sense. Time, opportunity, coverage all shows they could've released:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Edited video to the MSM

       <li>

         Unedited video to forums to prove their cojones.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         was done, 2. was not. Now why would they do that? When other organizations (not terrorists, but narcos) do it all the time?

       Believe it or not, they are actually very rational people (well those at the top). The motive is power, those at the top know this. Yes, there are crazy/ignorant "useful idiots", but the shot callers are very rational and savy. Now, what are you going on about. Let me ask you, how can you prove these are real? What evidence do you have to back up your claims. I've laid it out, your turn?

       Not unless you completely overlook the military strategy that this lead to. Why would you openly call out the President of the biggest military-industrial-complex nation on the globe? Especially if you're mainly just interested in carving up part of Iraq/Syria and instilling Shariah law, and want to just be left alone. If that's your end goal, these videos goaded the US into military action, exactly what these ISIL/ISIS people do not want. The American people were against war in Syria last year, and what do you think changed that?
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads me to believe that this scenario is quite obvious and the videos accomplished exactly what they were supposed to. To get US citizens to be OK with bombing more brown people to get us out of this recession. It's the only way.

       Now where is all your evidence to prove it actually happened? Like I said, I'm all ears. If you can prove me wrong, showing me a shadow of a doubt it "actually" happened. I will rescind my opinion and accept I'm wrong. But only till you point me to your evidence. Show me where a man lost his life, not just faded to black, like some cheep hollywood mellow drama. Show me proof, a man lost his life. Until then, photoshop can do wonders ;)

What makes you think they know one thing and their son knows another? You still haven't proven anything, you haven't submitted any facts for your opinion. Dude, are you serious?
