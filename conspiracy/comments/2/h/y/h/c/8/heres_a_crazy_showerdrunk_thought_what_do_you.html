Some people say freedom fighters, some say they have been infiltrated by government. My thought is this, may seem random and far fetched. But, so with the latest ISIL beheadings, that we know are fake as shit. The anon message is a message of faceless (headless) people joining a cause. Could this be a coincidence? I&#39;m not a troll, I&#39;ve been around for a while. I purge accounts and recreate from the ashes. Idk, I just watched this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1U01Wifs9ig">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1U01Wifs9ig</a> from : np.reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/2htseu/anonymous_haarpscalar_warning/">/r/conspiracy/comments/2htseu/anonymous_haarpscalar_warning/</a> and I just got a weird feeling in my gut. With all that is happening, I think the intelligence agencies are in on it. Could they be behind Annon? 4chan is dead, some speculate it was a psy-ops with the whole Quinnspiracy and fappening. They are pinning people up against others. The missing head really troubles me these days, because TPTB are all spouting off about the beheading of x allies/citizens. Is it all a ploy, hiding in plain site? Shit, just got out of the shower and have had a few beers. Would love to hear your thoughts. Maybe we could hash out some things from this, thought. lol. Thanks mates!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the proper question. The real question is <em>why</em> should we believe they are <em>real</em>? Things in the universe do not simply &quot;occur&quot; until proven they did not, it&#39;s the other way around.</p>

<p>If the West is trying to use these videos as justification for intervention, why should we buy it at face value? We&#39;ve already been burned numerous times by the BS they&#39;ll throw out there to start a <del>war</del> conflict.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s ISIS/L trying to show how &quot;badass&quot; they are, maybe they should try harder and not cop out with a lame fade to black. If you&#39;re <em>that</em> much of a badass then let&#39;s see it. Lord knows how many far more realistic and gruesome beheading videos exist on the internet, this is child&#39;s play.</p>

<p>So again, why in the world would we believe these videos as being real? Just because someone made them? I guess every Hollywood movie is non-fiction too then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is the card that gets pulled. every. single. time. Questioning any gruesome event and you get called a sick-o.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the deal. You and I will sit at home doing what we normally do for the next year or two. Whether we bomb ISIS/L, go back to Afghanistan/Iraq, destroy Syria/Iran, or whatever our next target is... <strong>we</strong> will remain relatively unaffected.</p>

<p>But what about those hundreds of thousands, even millions, of innocents who have their family members killed. Their houses destroyed. Their lives ruined. Don&#39;t even try to deny it, the Iraqis will gladly show you the aftermath of people who were not involved.</p>

<p>And then the billions upon billions of tax-payer dollars that will go to waste destroying these people, instead of going towards a one-payer Healthcare system. Not going to our infrastructure, our education, or our own economy. Nope, all of that going into the military industrial complex so we can blow up our new boogeyman.</p>

<p>So yes, I want some damn solid evidence that this conflict is worth it. If that takes me analyzing a beheading so that all this other bullshit can be avoided, I&#39;ll gladly do it.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re being counter-intuitive. If something happened, the onus of proof is on the party claiming it happened. You&#39;re implying that the beheading(s) happened. The burden is on you. From the videos that everybody is aware of - there is no evidence of a beheading - they all censor that part out (unlike countless <strong>real</strong> beheading videos from the last 10 years). That coupled with shady announcements by UK govt warning that viewing the video can constitute terrorism, the strange announcement by LiveLeak changing their long-held policy (since Ogrish days) on what videos they&#39;re willing to host, mainstream journals discussing the possibility that this was a hoax, the fact that the original video was outed by the organization <strong>known</strong> for providing the first fake Osama tape, etc. etc. etc.</p>

Why would you openly call out the President of the biggest military-industrial-complex nation on the globe? Especially if you&#39;re mainly just interested in carving up part of Iraq/Syria and instilling Shariah law, and want to just be left alone. If that&#39;s your end goal, these videos goaded the US into military action, exactly what these ISIL/ISIS people do not want. The American people were against war in Syria last year, and what do you think changed that?</p>

<p>This leads me to believe that this scenario is quite obvious and the videos accomplished exactly what they were supposed to. To get US citizens to be OK with bombing more brown people to get us out of this recession. It&#39;s the only way.</p>

How to fake a beheading.</p>

<p>Now where is all your evidence to prove it actually happened? Like I said, I&#39;m all ears. If you can prove me wrong, showing me a shadow of a doubt it &quot;actually&quot; happened. I will rescind my opinion and accept I&#39;m wrong. But only till you point me to your evidence. Show me where a man lost his life, not just faded to black, like some cheep hollywood mellow drama. Show me proof, a man lost his life. Until then, photoshop can do wonders ;)</p>

Been there, done that. What makes you think they know one thing and their son knows another? You still haven&#39;t proven anything, you haven&#39;t submitted any facts for your opinion. Dude, are you serious? Give me something, I told you I&#39;m open ears. I&#39;m objective and would like to see your links/facts. Where are they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not unless you completely overlook the military strategy that this lead to. Why would you openly call out the President of the biggest military-industrial-complex nation on the globe? Especially if you&#39;re mainly just interested in carving up part of Iraq/Syria and instilling Shariah law, and want to just be left alone. If that&#39;s your end goal, these videos goaded the US into military action, exactly what these ISIL/ISIS people do not want. The American people were against war in Syria last year, and what do you think changed that?</p>

<p>This leads me to believe that this scenario is quite obvious and the videos accomplished exactly what they were supposed to. To get US citizens to be OK with bombing more brown people to get us out of this recession. It&#39;s the only way.</p>
