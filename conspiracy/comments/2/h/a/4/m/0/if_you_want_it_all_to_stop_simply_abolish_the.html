       Oh come on stroke. You know as well as I do that our people wouldn't know what to do with it. Also fed reserve based inflation has kind of ruined the value of anything we could seize from them. Fact is as a donation to the third world we would get more bang for the resources. And as  the third world develops it will become more and more difficult for the rich capitalists in the US to manipulate the work force.

       Honestly, i didnt think of it that way. You make a good point with these two lines, although other two points you made im not sure i agree on entirely. But the two i quoted above, those are good points man. I didnt consider it that way...

       Although, if the value is diminished for our people, why wouldnt it also be devalued for the third world countries?

       Because of exchange rate. US currency is worth much more in places with really devalued currency. If the infrastructure could support it we could build an entire fleet of space shuttles in Africa for what it costs to maintain and utilize the couple we ran for awhile in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess the real way this would shake out is that the US treasury department would have to create and issue a new currency. The first job of this new currency would probably be to bail out and purchase all the assets of the federal reserve bank. Because you know, the rich almost always get off scot free. That's just how history and humanity function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I am considering it from this angle it is actually possible that disbanding and buying out the fed could be more expensive than all the inflation they have ever cost us. Unless of course we are willing to be sharp with these dastardly people and buy their assets as devalued junk based against a strong treasury issued currency.

       This could be feasible. But the most wealthy of the "innocent" folks might also be hurt by such acquisition, no? Kind of like collateral damage in a way...

       Maybe.. But from my perspective I grew up extremely poor. I come from a trailer park. So to my thinking it is impossible to imagine an innocent wealthy person. I believe that to become wealthy one must sacrifice one's morals and humanity. Even if you simply inherited the money to possess it and live like a god in the face so much poverty and suffering on the world? Well you've got to be kind of a motherfucker to do that.

       This is very likely the case. Especially from the perspective of wealthy minded reformers. People like that have a lot of money and interest invested in the state and so they need it hail and hearty so that it continue to serve them. But a man like me? All those millions like me? We really have very little to lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the lawyer parallel I think it fits. But what if the lawyer decided to stop acting from within the law? Yes he cannot retrieve his case and win in court. But he can put a bullet in the brain of the murderer and contrive to get away with it. Thus justice is done, even though not in a court.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is that same kind of off-road justice that will be necessary to deal with the fed. The major problem here though is that once you go off-road you invite your opponents onto the same battlefield with you. Just as you put down the law as a constraint, so can they. And then as things escalate we could find ourselves within at all here but ruins. Or we could find ourselves in a very nice society with a whole generation of greedy scum sucking dirt in the cemetary. From such things could come a golden age.

       I, too, come from poverty. So i understand your resentment. However, i have met plenty of more affluent folks who got there by their own merit, without beating down others to rise above. But ill agree that, probably, the vast majority of the wealthy folks do so by less than honorable means.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also tend to be very empathetic in real life. So i am troubled with the idea of hurting the innocent as collateral damage. Though, if i were rich, i would give up the shackles thst comes with wealth in favor of a free world, in a heart beat.

       I would argue that they already do. I think many woukd argue this, as it is quite obvious imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do feel that another revolution is in order. It must be. As terrifying as the idea is, without it, we will be enslaved indefinately (im thinking about our future generations here too...)
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont see a peacful solution on the horizon, sadly. Though, ideally, it most certainly can be achieved, if only the 10% would give up their stranglehold on the 90%. But realistically, they wont. Pure and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       I espcially liked how the lawyer remained within the law. I feel that we must try to do the same. It would be a herculean task, but massively beneficial nonetheless. I see it as a puzzle. The answer exists, we just have to find it. (Much easier said than done, though.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But one last point, even a revolution is within the scope of the law. Such was the intent of the framers, but as a last resort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just dont have much faith in our people to conduct it wisely. Thats the scary part, imo. Its doomed to fail from the start unless we go about it the right way.

       Not exactly. It is very close to this but it does seem like there are certain things they don't do. For instance here I speak out against them but none of their storm troopers have kicked in my door and slaughtered my family yet. Which they will certainly do if I abrogate my legal protections by taking up arms against them.

       Maybe.. I think there is another way though. I got idea from reading about the conflict of the orders in Roman times. Basically the underclass marched out of the city and set up shop nearby to start a new city. The rich needed those soldiers and so they gave in. The social contract got renegotiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we can do this. All we have to do is stop paying taxes. Yeah they will put a lot of us in jail. But if we do things right. If we close ranks in our neighborhoods and don't let the cops come in to get people who don't pay we can stop them. We can even use violence if necessary because at that point the state will have started the battle, not us. They will have lost whatever claim to the moral high ground they might have pretended to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire world economy is based on the US dollar. More specifically on the idea that the owners of the US can tax the people in perpetuity to pay off any outstanding loans or sold treasury bonds. If that surety becomes shakened I think that the owners would have no choice but to try and negotiate. We'd need to push them for a new constitutional convention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think a 100% peaceful solution will be possible because the state will almost certainly use force against any attempt rebellion or revolution. I just think that when they begin to use force would be the time to use it against them. I have a mind full of tactics on that subject.

       I'm not so sure, but either way my point is that it is not guaranteed by a national government, or indeed anybody. That is clearly part of its appeal for its users.

       Well, I agree with you agreeing with my sentiment : D
      </p>
      <p>
       But, seems the case can be made:
      </p>
      <p>
       'Fiat money is currency which derives its value from government regulation or law. It differs from commodity money, which is based on a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange. The term derives from the Latin fiat ("let it be done", "it shall be").' Wiki
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Wiki isn't the be all and end all, but there seems no reason I can think of to distrust this definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first statement is value through regulation or law, it could be argued that algorithmic puzzles required to be solved, that increase in complexity over time is an innate law currently built into the model, this also serves to regulate the currency as you cannot create the currency (or so the theory goes) without following the law of Bitcoin and solving the puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The secondly it is not a commodity money, based on a good that's used other than a medium of exchange. The hardware depreciated and degrades overtime, and the power consumed is lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       lastly, fiat being it shall be or let it be done, well... It's a virtual currency, not sure it gets more let it be than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition makes no mention of issuance as long as it's within the law or regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not an expert, but that'd be my argument.

       Bitcoin is a fascinating concept but it cannot, and never will be "fiat" according to the accepted definition of that term, because a fiat is an order or decree that must come from an authority of some sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin is stateless, it has no governing body or guarantor. This is both a strength and a weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are similarities between fiat and crypto-currencies, not least the fact that they are both intrinsically worthless.

       There is a commodity behind bitcoin, the aggregate CPU time of all computers running the bitcoin client. CPU time is big business. Consider that Cars 2 required over 2,000,000 hours  CPU time at a data center to render, against the fact that Cars 2 grossed 550,000,000 worldwide, and was not a particularly high grossing film.

       The algorithms in bitcoin calculate large primes. Why would someone  want to calculate large primes? Cryptographic purposes is why!
       <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/7377/why-are-very-large-prime-numbers-important-in-cryptography">
        Why are large primes important to cryptography?
       </a>
       So the technology powering bitcoin could potentially create a marketplace that commoditizes encryption/decryption. You as a party interested in encrypting your data could make a monetary decision about how safely encrypted your data is. Similarly, a decrypting party, could determine, monetarily, whether it was worth its effort to attempt to decrypt some specified data. Who would be interested in an idea like that? Intelligence agencies, security minded business entities, wealthy people, ya da ya da... But powerful interests, that's who.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast to other proposed commodity currencies, digital currencies reflect a modern approach to trade. They are calculable, based on a physical good (hardware), fungible, distributable, and so on. In comparison, gold is a joke. Gold's value is based almost entirely on its popularity as a material for jewelry. (
       <a href="http://geology.com/minerals/gold/uses-of-gold.shtml#jewelry">
        78% of gold used for jewelry
       </a>
       That doesn't sound like a bedrock plan for economic stability to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, digital currencies are based on the current underpinnings of economic reality. That is to say -&gt; WE LIVE IN THE INFORMATION AGE! &lt;- not the bronze age, not medieval times, not the gilded age, and definitely not the mineral exploitation age (mineral exploitation becoming "informationalized" as well.) Silicon (or any other computing substrate) form the basis of our daily lives. From the 3 billion user strong global computer network used to transmit my ill thought ideas to you, to the ergonomically designed tracking device you'll probably be carrying in your pocket all day, we are connected via code, and code is only meaningful (to the hoi polloi) in terms of its interface with physical reality.

       I have no idea on the stability of bitcoin but the entire point of bitcoin is to be the antithesis to fiat currency. It is not backed by government legislation and there is a determined finite supply of money. These 2 things make it the direct opposite of fiat currency.
