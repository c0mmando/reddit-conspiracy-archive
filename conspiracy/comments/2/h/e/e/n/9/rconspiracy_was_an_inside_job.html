        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">112</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-09-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/laborinvain.html">laborinvain</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The subreddit r/conspiracy has been under attack for a long time. Disinfo flooding the gates. Discredit trolls, posting the absurdly, utterly, provably nutjob worst in order to make the whole Sub seem crazy. And then just blathering posts that take space and lower the signal to noise ratio.</p>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with all these tactics, going back over a decade online. But nothing can kill an online community faster than an inside job. A good example was the &quot;Scholars for 911 Truth.&quot;</p>

<p>Steven Jones, a fairly prominent physicists who had bona fides with the US Department of Energy, began to raise questions about how the World Trade Center buildings managed to collapse on 9/11. Jones was anything but a crackpot. He was published and had actually been instrumental in debunking the claims that cold fusion had been achieved back in the 90s.</p>

<p>Once he spoke out, other academics began to speak out and they all got together and decided to create a website to voice their observations and concerns.</p>

<p>Because of the credibility and stature of the participants, this new group of academics became a severe threat to the official 911 narrative. And presumably to the conspirators. </p>

<p>Enter james Fetzer. Fetzer had already had a long career spreading crazy bullshit to discredit the JFK assassination research community. Now he was targeting the 911 truth movement.</p>

<p>His method was simple, and lethal for the new 911 Scholars. First, he took over the website part of the operation. The other agreed to let him run that side of things because he said he had experience and they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>This was their fatal mistake. A big announcement was made, which spread around the net, about the forthcoming Scholars for 911 Truth, and then the website was launched.</p>

<p>But no sooner than the site had gone live, Fetzer sabotaged it. To Steven Jones and the rest of the credible scholars who had enlisted&#39;s horror, Fetzer smeared the home page with a bunch of crazy theories involving space beams and other nonsense that no one had approved or even remotely supported.</p>

<p>And when the Scholars complained and tried to remedy the situation, they found they were locked out of the site.</p>

<p>And that was that for the new Scholars for 911 Truth. A group that would have done more to legitimize the questioning of the official 911 narrative than any other, was now associated permanently with space beams and &quot;dustification,&quot; a word with zero basis in science.</p>

<p>Of course, Jones and the others quickly disassociated themselves from Fetzer&#39;s little con job, but it was too late. The damage had been done, and any future attempts to use academic prestige to break through the 911 taboo would fail to have an impact (though the Architects and Engineers are making a grand play.)</p>

<p>Well, today, I just saw this clever stunt pulled again. This time, by some of the Mods of r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t watched to whole thing. But I&#39;ve watched a couple hours of it and I can say, incontrovertibly, the documentary &quot;Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told&quot; is Neo-Nazi propaganda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the most perverse kind of propaganda that uses a dramatic music score to touch our heart strings, as we hear that Adolf Hitler wasn&#39;t such a bad guy.</p>

<p>Please understand where I&#39;m coming from. I think Israel is a terrorist state. I believe its existence is illegitimate. I believe its leaders are guilty of war crimes.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t stop there. I am opposed to the Jewish religion. Any religion that encourages the kind of racism I see in Jewish culture, is a perversion of spirituality. Any religious culture that believes that they are &quot;God&#39;s chosen people&quot; is disgusting to me and reeks of the kind of devotion to genetic purity that the Nazis and Eugenicists were so guilty of. The demands that your sons only marry Jewish women is pure racism. </p>

<p>But watching this film tell me that Hitler &quot;had honorable intentions&quot; while this dripping, sentimental, heroic music plays in the background literally made me want to puke.</p>

<p>I have long known of Hitler&#39;s populist appeal. Unlike most people, I sought out the other side of the story long ago. I&#39;ve read large blocks of Mein Kampf, sought and found translations of his speeches, and even read Neo-Nazi literature. </p>

<p>Like all popular figures, Hitler had some strong selling points. He identified the bankster parasites and made them an enemy of the common man - though he mistakenly conflated banksters with Jews - most bankers of the time were not Jewish, Rothschilds notwithstanding. But there was truth in his words, no doubt. Otherwise, they would have had no effect.</p>

<p>But none of that should ever, for even a second, allow us to forget the evil of this motherfucker&#39;s reign. I have believed since my childhood that racism, especially the kind that breeds Eugenicists, is an acute form of mental illness.</p>

<p>To hate someone, not because of what they do, but because of who they are, is pure sickness. Hitler fed that sickness. And he exploited it.</p>

<p>If the moderators of r/conspiracy share this sickness, and allow it to fester here, then you are my enemy. </p>

<p>Or, more likely, if the moderators of r/conspiracy who allowed this film to be branded on to this Sub, are using the repulsiveness of Naziism to discredit the people who dare to ask the questions that power want&#39;s us to ignore, then you are my enemy.</p>

<p>This was a decent place to aggregate news and info that one wouldn&#39;t find easily elsewhere. Important things that happen in the shadows of power. </p>

<p>You have now, very likely, killed it. And fuck you for that.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t think you have won. As long as there&#39;s an internet, we will keep aggregating. And the truth will keep getting spread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it.</p>

<p>I just finished PMing another <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> Redditor about the Adolf Hitler &quot;stickied, mod-approved&quot; thread.</p>

<p>It really is a watershed moment for this sub, and as a community.</p>

<p>Most things that get posted here don&#39;t have the significance that requires individual response.  Most things can be ignored.</p>

<p>Some things require that every person stand up and bear witness.</p>

<p>Today was a Rubicon.  The moderator who approved that stickied post has created a division that must be addressed by every person who subscribes/posts/participates at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Because if you don&#39;t address what happened today, you become a passive part of the problem.</p>

<p>That documentary is, indeed, Neo-Nazi propaganda.</p>

<p>I agree with <a href="/u/laborinvain">/u/laborinvain</a>&#39;s very important words here.</p>

<p>This sub has now been claimed by Neo-Nazis as their own, and one of them is a moderator.</p>

<p>That requires a response from each of us in our own way.</p>

<p>Also, it could not have been more effective or cliched in giving opponents of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> the perfect evidence to demonize this sub and this sub&#39;s occasionally very important content.</p>

<p>For that reason alone, we should be demanding that somebody step down over this.  Whether or not it was COINTELPRO or just bad judgement, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has taken a potentially fatal wound today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this. I agree with pretty much everything you said. The r/conspiracy well has now been poisoned in the same way that the 9/11 truth well was poisoned. I&#39;ve seen how &quot;The Jews did it&quot;, no planes, holograms, space beams, and all of the other ridiculous 9/11 disinfo has been used to drown out careful and important research into what really happened. I can fully understand how someone new to the subject would do a little research, come across that bullshit, and become disgusted with the whole movement. The same thing has been happening to r/conspiracy. As more and more people get angry about NSA revelations and endless war, there is a greater and greater willingness to question the government on a lot of things. r/conspiracy COULD be a great resource for those people. But if they come here now, they have instant validation of the smears that they&#39;ve already heard. We hate Jews. We hate America. We&#39;re ready to believe the most ridiculous things with no evidence.  </p>

<p>The neonazis and their sockpuppets (and they may not even be real neonazis) have scored a modest victory today. They&#39;ve made a place of learning look like a place of ignorance. I&#39;ve been keeping tabs on a few of them, so I know that those pushing the neonazi angle have also been pushing &quot;no planes&quot; and other loony disinfo. They are quite organized. They post dozens of items every day, and usually get at least one to the front page of the sub. There are ways to fight back against these tactics though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I quit ATS when this shit went down a few years back. I guess I will have to move on. I am all for the uncensored history, but Hitler is not how you do it. Our sidebar makes us look like crazy assed Jew haters. I cannot believe this shit is allowed. The mods of this sub did more to discredit us than <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> could have ever imagined. Don&#39;t believe everything you see people. There is truth and fiction in everything, it is merely determined by the bias of that who is presenting it. I hate that after three years it has come to this, but there is no choice. I have advocated leaving for awhile, but now it HAS to happen. Good luck fellow truth seekers. Maybe I will see you again in some little corner of the world wide web or in other subreddits where shit is still informative.</p>

<p>Edit: Before one of you can even say it. NO! You cannot save this sinking pile of shit. We cannot work hard and bring it back to its former glory. Toughen up and move on. It has been a year or so of this shit getting progressively worse. Pull your head out of your ASS and UNSUBSCRIBE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is telling you to &quot;go around praising Hitler&quot;, nor is that the purpose of the documentary.  You really should take some time to watch it.  Even if you don&#39;t agree with everything in it, or with the way some of it&#39;s presented (and I don&#39;t on both counts), it&#39;s still full of incredible historical information and it will likely make you question at least some of what you thought you knew about WWII.</p>

<p>I think this would be a great opportunity to refer people to the work of real meticulous researchers (not some guy who feels compelled to do this &#39;great work of truth-telling&#39; as related to him by his Nazi-employed Axis soldier father) like Joseph Farrell, Peter Levenda, and Mae Brussell (fascinating woman, who personally hand-indexed the Warren Commission report and predicted the RFK assassination and Reagan assassination attempt <em>the day before each happened</em>) who have done great work analyzing Nazism as a terror/cult phenomenon that happened to seize control of an entire nation, then went back underground and worldwide once that nation was defeated and they were compromised with by the slightly-less-morally-bankrupt Western powers.  </p>

<p>Why is the entire English-speaking world going Fascist before our eyes?</p>

<p>Why is Chase Manhattan&#39;s logo a stylized swastika?</p>

<p>How did Martin Bormann, who &#39;died in the bunker,&#39; clear a check for millions through Chase and Deutschebank over his own signature in the 70s?</p>

<p>Why is r/conspiracy (which I consider more r/altgeopolitics or r/mediacritique) flooded with dudes obsessed with revealing those dirty Hebes, or whatever?</p>

<p>You might find some answers to some of those questions with the sources I reference.</p>

<p>I say this as someone who loathes the Israeli government as much as I loathe the governments of Britain and the USA for the New Axis Powers that they are, and suspects that 9/11 might very well have been in part contracted out to Mossad.  </p>

The Soviets killed more than the Nazis and the U.S. was filled with Ku Klux Klan and had just finished exterminating the Native American population. Both sides carpet bombed cities, and all parties had a history of racism, genocide, ethnic cleansing, as far back as time. There were no good guys in the war and the U.S. would have never entered into in the first place if not for treason in the highest office of the land.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you write this now as I am just starting on my journey towards investigating an alternative view of Hitler and WW2 in general. I think this is mainly because of how our governments (US &amp; UK) have lied to us about Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia/Ukraine etc., which has got me wondering how future generations will remember these conflicts/hostilities.</p>

<p>Churchill himself said that &quot;history is written by the victors&quot; so if we do &#39;win&#39; - whatever that means or might entail - will we be painted as saints, as opposed to terrorist states that dismantle anything that might pose a threat to our hegemony? Will Israel be remembered in the vision of our mainstream media? Will the UN/IMF/World Bank be considered as anything other than US-controlled institutions?</p>

<p>What is of particular interest to me is that the general population during the WW2 period would have had very little exposure to alternative sources of information like we do, and I wonder if our understanding of this war would have been different if they did. For example, would the school indoctrination been any different? Would it have been illegal to deny the Holocaust despite the inconsistencies in some of the survivors&#39; accounts (Irene Zisblatt, in particular)?</p>

<p>Can I ask which translations of Mein Kampf you read? I&#39;m currently looking into the Ford translation. I&#39;ve also got some NatSoc videos that I want to take a look at. As it stands, I&#39;m of the opinion that Hitler was bad, but we weren&#39;t exactly whiter than white (and I know that Wall Street made a fair bit of money by funding both sides). It also seems coincidental that Hitler appeared to be fighting Zionism, which some might argue is crippling the world economy today, not to mention militarily trampling anyone that stands in their way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The subreddit r/conspiracy has been under attack for a long time. Disinfo flooding the gates. Discredit trolls, posting the absurdly, utterly, provably nutjob worst in order to make the whole Sub seem crazy. And then just blathering posts that take space and lower the signal to noise ratio.</p>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with all these tactics, going back over a decade online. But nothing can kill an online community faster than an inside job. A good example was the &quot;Scholars for 911 Truth.&quot;</p>

<p>Steven Jones, a fairly prominent physicists who had bona fides with the US Department of Energy, began to raise questions about how the World Trade Center buildings managed to collapse on 9/11. Jones was anything but a crackpot. He was published and had actually been instrumental in debunking the claims that cold fusion had been achieved back in the 90s.</p>

<p>Once he spoke out, other academics began to speak out and they all got together and decided to create a website to voice their observations and concerns.</p>

<p>Because of the credibility and stature of the participants, this new group of academics became a severe threat to the official 911 narrative. And presumably to the conspirators. </p>

<p>Enter james Fetzer. Fetzer had already had a long career spreading crazy bullshit to discredit the JFK assassination research community. Now he was targeting the 911 truth movement.</p>

<p>His method was simple, and lethal for the new 911 Scholars. First, he took over the website part of the operation. The other agreed to let him run that side of things because he said he had experience and they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>This was their fatal mistake. A big announcement was made, which spread around the net, about the forthcoming Scholars for 911 Truth, and then the website was launched.</p>

<p>But no sooner than the site had gone live, Fetzer sabotaged it. To Steven Jones and the rest of the credible scholars who had enlisted&#39;s horror, Fetzer smeared the home page with a bunch of crazy theories involving space beams and other nonsense that no one had approved or even remotely supported.</p>

<p>And when the Scholars complained and tried to remedy the situation, they found they were locked out of the site.</p>

<p>And that was that for the new Scholars for 911 Truth. A group that would have done more to legitimize the questioning of the official 911 narrative than any other, was now associated permanently with space beams and &quot;dustification,&quot; a word with zero basis in science.</p>

<p>Of course, Jones and the others quickly disassociated themselves from Fetzer&#39;s little con job, but it was too late. The damage had been done, and any future attempts to use academic prestige to break through the 911 taboo would fail to have an impact (though the Architects and Engineers are making a grand play.)</p>

<p>Well, today, I just saw this clever stunt pulled again. This time, by some of the Mods of r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t watched to whole thing. But I&#39;ve watched a couple hours of it and I can say, incontrovertibly, the documentary &quot;Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told&quot; is Neo-Nazi propaganda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the most perverse kind of propaganda that uses a dramatic music score to touch our heart strings, as we hear that Adolf Hitler wasn&#39;t such a bad guy.</p>

<p>Please understand where I&#39;m coming from. I think Israel is a terrorist state. I believe its existence is illegitimate. I believe its leaders are guilty of war crimes.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t stop there. I am opposed to the Jewish religion. Any religion that encourages the kind of racism I see in Jewish culture, is a perversion of spirituality. Any religious culture that believes that they are &quot;God&#39;s chosen people&quot; is disgusting to me and reeks of the kind of devotion to genetic purity that the Nazis and Eugenicists were so guilty of. The demands that your sons only marry Jewish women is pure racism. </p>

<p>But watching this film tell me that Hitler &quot;had honorable intentions&quot; while this dripping, sentimental, heroic music plays in the background literally made me want to puke.</p>

<p>I have long known of Hitler&#39;s populist appeal. Unlike most people, I sought out the other side of the story long ago. I&#39;ve read large blocks of Mein Kampf, sought and found translations of his speeches, and even read Neo-Nazi literature. </p>

<p>Like all popular figures, Hitler had some strong selling points. He identified the bankster parasites and made them an enemy of the common man - though he mistakenly conflated banksters with Jews - most bankers of the time were not Jewish, Rothschilds notwithstanding. But there was truth in his words, no doubt. Otherwise, they would have had no effect.</p>

<p>But none of that should ever, for even a second, allow us to forget the evil of this motherfucker&#39;s reign. I have believed since my childhood that racism, especially the kind that breeds Eugenicists, is an acute form of mental illness.</p>

<p>To hate someone, not because of what they do, but because of who they are, is pure sickness. Hitler fed that sickness. And he exploited it.</p>

<p>If the moderators of r/conspiracy share this sickness, and allow it to fester here, then you are my enemy. </p>

<p>Or, more likely, if the moderators of r/conspiracy who allowed this film to be branded on to this Sub, are using the repulsiveness of Naziism to discredit the people who dare to ask the questions that power want&#39;s us to ignore, then you are my enemy.</p>

<p>This was a decent place to aggregate news and info that one wouldn&#39;t find easily elsewhere. Important things that happen in the shadows of power. </p>

<p>You have now, very likely, killed it. And fuck you for that.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t think you have won. As long as there&#39;s an internet, we will keep aggregating. And the truth will keep getting spread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The winners write history I&#39;m afraid, the stigmatization of the nazis is propaganda. You can be thrown in jail here in germany for even questioning the holocaust&#39;s statistics, which is obviously enforcing a form of thoughtcrime. The Bolsheviks killed almost 100 million or more russians, but people can still fly the communist flag. They need the illusory holocaust to serve as a justification for what they are doing in Gaza. The amount of money being siphoned off from Germany every year due to this fantasy is absurd. I would estimate maybe 5% of Jews are actually harming and corrupting humanity, the rest are just normal people used as shields by the elite. No one group is responsible for the suffering of all of humanity, however Jewish created ideologies like Communism and Feminism have wreaked havoc on the western world and communism especially has caused more human suffering than any other ideology in human history which is cause for great concern. I hate the neo nazis, they are too hateful and do not follow Hitler&#39;s philosophy whatsoever unfortunately. Hitler&#39;s ultimate goal, which he stated in Mein Kampf and many of his speeches, was to destroy communism and liberate the peoples of Russia from the genocidal grip of Stalin. Which he indeed tried to do, and many of the people living in towns he took from the Russians praised him as he allowed them to practice Christianity again and gave them more freedoms than Stalin did. Was he perfect? Hell no, but he sure as hell wasn&#39;t the monster the propaganda would have you believe. Hitler represented a threat to the established order of things, Stalin was much much worse ethically speaking, but the Allies didn&#39;t care did they. The effort to crush Hitler&#39;s regime was an effort to crush dissent against communism and against the degradation of European values and culture.</p>

<p>I actually believed this crap(the movie you mentioned), though only for a short period of time after I started delving into conspiracy, and had no real sense of up or down in the world. The mods should know better and be able to actually discern this fraudulent propaganda for what it really is. The concentration camps I think were fake in that they weren&#39;t used to exterminate people or that they were specifically used just for Jewish people, however that doesn&#39;t mean the populations within weren&#39;t abused, starved to death or used for Nazi experimentation as they were a non existent under class of people during a time of warfare in Hitler&#39;s fascist socialist government. </p>

<p>Jewish conspiracy is a joke, the entire financial structure of the NWO is rooted through anglo/european countries, along with that the U.N. is the institution which ratified Hitler&#39;s founding of Israel in the early 1950s, Jews this Jews that, its hegelian mind games, and the mods should know this psych warfare garbage for what it is.</p>

<p>No. I&#39;m not arguing that at all. I&#39;m stating that this &quot;documentary&quot; is propaganda, and that pinning it here is a tacit, if not outright, endorsement of it.</p>

<p>Secondly, I&#39;ve watched now over 2 hours of this thing, and there is nothing worthy in it. Even when it says something that is materially true, it is wrapped so much in lies and distortions, that it is rendered irredeemable in any respect. </p>

<p>That is the nature of propaganda. Even when it speaks truth, it only does so to sell a bigger lie.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are many who would love nothing more than to spend hours debating the merits or lack thereof of these videos. I will not participate in that discussion.</p>

<p>I am merely making a last ditch appeal to any of the mods here who have retained their senses, and do not subscribe to Neo-Nazi apologia, to make remedy of this situation by banning those responsible and making an apology to the members here who, I am quite certain, did not sign on to participating in what now appears a Neo-Nazi sympathizing subbreddit.</p>

<p>Oh Jesus. So you haven&#39;t seen it and yet you wrote this condemnatory tirade... because of some music choice in a 6 hour documentary? And then you go on to declare that its dissemination here is a successful conspiracy to kill the subreddit? </p>

<p><em>Wow.</em> This documentary is <strong><em>controversial</em></strong>. That&#39;s it, your irrational *(and apparently popular) response has convinced me to watch it. Next time you probably should too before you go all Chicken Little. Same goes for everyone upvoting and backslapping in here.</p>

<p>From the video&#39;s <a href="http://thegreateststorynevertold.tv/10-reasons-why-hitler-was-one-of-the-good-guys/">website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler was probably the hero of the second world war and the 21st century. A man of ethical courage, a man of spiritual perception and good intent. A spiritual soul who cared – cared about all life forms, all cultures, about goodness and Light and ultimately about Truth.</p>

<p>Because he was one of the good guys.</p>

<p>Sounds like Neo-Nazi garbage to me.</p>
