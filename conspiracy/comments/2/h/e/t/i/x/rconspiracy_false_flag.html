       This reminds me of the recent goings on at 4chan.

       A controversy gets started, then you get a flood of sjw mods coming in to solve "the problem". To my way of thinking, political correctness is just the modern term for censorship. And that's what sjw's are all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could post pretty much anything you want when it comes to conspiracies. But if there's one area you want to be careful of, it's conspiracies based on "certain ethnic affiliations". It's the old tension between freedom of expression and hate speech.

       No it's just when you're trying to open people's minds and you say "hey check out this website it's really cool they have a lot of interesting things on it".  And you go to the site and the first thing that pops up is a big picture of fucking Hitler.  That person is NOT going to open his/her mind.  That person is going to close the browser and think "damn I thought this guy was cool but he's an ignorant racist who browses Hitler forums" and never talk to you again.   You have to know that people see Hitler as bad.  And any amount of trying to explain why you're showing Hitler documentaries isn't going to cut it with those people and frankly doesn't cut it with me.

       You may be offended by Hitler topics and lots of people are offended by other topics. You have a fucking brain and you can chose to ignore stuff. Otherwise if you start censoring everything then this sub dies. Honestly we dont need people like you in this sub!

       Thanks for understanding. Here's my problem. Everybody still thinks the internet is some kind of wild west, anything goes free speech forum. It used to be, but things are changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're familiar with Marshall McLuhan, you'll know that saying about how "The medium is the message."
      </p>
      <p>
       He was talking about television.... a medium where the viewer passively observes the content. So the message is passivity and acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the message for the internet? On first glance, it would appear to be activity and participation. You seek out the sites that interest you. Participate in discussions and even create and upload your own content.  But there's another side to this that most people don't often consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this participation is by permission only. Let's use reddit itself as an example. Reddit is a business and, as such, has owners. These owners are going to make sure that their business is run in the way that is good for business. That's what forms the basis for their values. The owners will only hire admins that share these values (or at least put them into practice). This gets passed from the admins to the moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the message is that members of reddit only get to participate in reddit if they display conformity to the values of the owners/admins. Conformity to the values of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       This might not be the case with every website right now, but it looks like that's the way things are going. If the medium is the message, the internet is not about freedom and individuality..... it's about conforming to the values of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who doesn't believe me is free to check out the rules section of the sidebar. Go ahead and make some comments that break the rules. Then see how long your free speech rights keep the mods from banning you.

       Nicely said. I want to add a little bit, concerning free speech directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people dont understand that our right of free speech only applies to public spaces. Reddit, facebook, etc, is owned by folks. They are not public domain. Therefore, the owners have full ownership of the content within their domain. To limit their sovereignty upon their intellectual property would be limiting their rights as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, if i invite you into my home, and then you start preaching to me about jesus, i have every right to ask (not
       <strong>
        force
       </strong>
       ) you to stop. Should you refuse, i have every right to revoke that invitation and ban you from my domain. Same goes for these forums and social platforms on the net.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the right of free speech only protects you from the government. It guarentees us that we can address our grievances, however trivial or factual, we might have, in an unsuppressed manner. The government cannot stop us (legally) from standing in a public space and preach that all of our leaders are reptilian overlords. They cant even ask us to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, another passerby is still allowed to tell you (not
       <strong>
        force
       </strong>
       you) to shut the fuck up. He has every right to call you a dumbass bitch for what you preach. That is
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       right to argue and say what he believes. A lot of folks get upset, invoke their right to free speech and stuff, when someone tries to tell them they are stupid or whatever, then they try to limit the free speech of the ones arguing them. Hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the shot that westboro baptist gets for theor picketts. They are completely offensive, and i despise their ideology and methods of dissemination, but they have a right to express their beliefs, just like i have a right to express the fact that i believe they are delluded motherfuckers that have no respect for the people who died fighting for their right to say what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, they cannot be on the cemetary grounds during the funeral, as that is private domain. They can pickett on the streets and sidewalks like they do, legally, no matter their message.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, coming full circle, it can be viewed as a good thing to allow censorship within private domains. To disallow it is to limit the rights of the domains owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for r/conspiracy, i am greatful that, for the most part, censorship is not rampant and we get to discuss, in full detail sometimes, our beliefs, speculations, and theories about the most controversial topics. However, should reddit decide that we can no longer talk or discuss or analyze or even acknowledge holocaust revisionism, they have every right to do so. Its
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im just glad they havent gone that far (yet.)

       Either nothing gets censored or everything will. If the jews did it, they might've did it. It's a plausible side to the story. I personally tend to skip over it for better meat, but there are infinite possibilities and you can't let political correctness get in the way.

       People are interested in WW2, posting a Hitler side image will attract more people for the simple reason that people find all things WW2 interesting.
      </p>

       I was not alive during WW2 and personally have mixed feelings on the topic, but no one is going to be driven away by a WW2 documentary except for maybe a WW2 vet who doesn't like thinking about, or some crying little bitch. People spent countless hours in their high school and college history and social studies classes discussing various points of views -- I'm pretty sure people can handle it.

       The voting system here and all over reddit is dysfunctional and inorganic. That means it is not a sound basis for determining the wants, desires and majority opinion of the groups it represents.

       You know all this shit already, playing stupid is evidence of complicity. You're hiding behind a 'majority opinion' that cannot be determined to authentic.

       I did not realise this is voted upon by the community, I was under the impression that documentaries were suggested and then the mods picked the most popular one. Either way this new doc should not be plastered on the front of our sub, it gives the wrong impression.

       I myself cannot say which ones we can and cannot have, I am just one guy. However I love this community and it's related content and do not want it to be any more compromised. By allowing things like this to be stickied on our sub gives off the wrong impression and opens us up to more criticism and more importantly debate on whether r/conspiracy has gone to far and whether it's time for some big shot to step in and delete it. I get the impression they are just waiting for something like this to be used as an excuse. As a post it's fine, it can be voted upon and therefore it's importance decided in the sub by the users, having it stickied is too far in my opinion.

       Not that i condone the holocaust revisionism thing, but didnt people find it offensive when some dude said the world was spherical, not flat?

       Just because something offends other people doesnt mean it should be censored. I didnt watch this documentary, but ive done some resesrch. Imo, some arguments are certainly valid. But a lot of people take it too far and use it to support their bigotry and hatred of others. That is wrong.

       No matter how much it offends others, both sides of each story must be analyzed, lest we yield to bias and vacate our sovereignty to logical deducement ourselves...

       Yes but do you understand that we get complaints about every single post in this sub?  Everyone is offended by something.  So if we limit ourselves based upon "someone might be offended by this guys" then we may as well make the sub private, ban everyone and turn the lights out for good.

       No it's just when you're trying to open people's minds and you say "hey check out this website it's really cool they have a lot of interesting things on it".  And you go to the site and the first thing that pops up is a big picture of fucking Hitler.  That person is NOT going to open his/her mind.  That person is going to close the browser and think "damn I thought this guy was cool but he's an ignorant racist who browses Hitler forums" and never talk to you again.   You have to know that people see Hitler as bad.  And any amount of trying to explain why you're showing Hitler documentaries isn't going to cut it with those people and frankly doesn't cut it with me.
