        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This film doesn&#39;t break any reddit rules, nor does it even break any Youtube rules. It is not promoting hate, or violence against anyone. It&#39;s is simply a  historical film from a different perspective to what we are used to, and you do NOT have to be a &quot;neo nazi&quot;, nor do you have to believe all of the claims being made in the film to appreciate that. </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t people simply enjoy it as a propaganda piece? Everyone here loved the North Korean &quot;propagandafilm&quot; which was also stickied, and which was extremely critical of Jews and the west.</p>

<p>The same people who are bitching about this, are the same people who would love to see controversial films like this one censored and removed from the internet entirely, and I believe this ignorant view is potentially incredibly dangerous. </p>

<p>This sub is pro freedom of speech for a very good reason. We may not all personally agree with moon landing hoax, alien or other specific conspiracy theories, but we appreciate having the opportunity to be exposed to these theories so we can come to our own conclusions.</p>

<p>If this film offends you - then don&#39;t watch it. Simple as that.</p>

<p>People need to take a breath and approach this situation objectively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it depicts Hitler&#39;s many military achievements as a young man in WWI and in the beginning of WWII plus all the positive things he did for Germany and the German people as far as it&#39;s economic recovery and return to power after the allies fucked them over with the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.  </p>

<p>It also uses a lot of uplifting/triumphant sounding music during parts which are usually reserved for dark/terrifying music that we&#39;ve all been programmed to associate with Hitler and the Nazis.  I found it&#39;s use of music in the background to be the most interesting.  What a difference a score makes when it comes to your emotions.  I&#39;ll have to pay more attention to these things in the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people who grew up in western society were taught from a super young age to believe that Hitler was the living embodiment of evil, and that nobody in history ever came close to matching his evilness and brutality. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t reality, though. Most communist leaders made him look very benevolent in comparison.  Also, this documentary does something that most documentaries don&#39;t. It shows Hitler&#39;s human side. It shows him spending time with people, his dog, and it shows him behaving like a normal person and doing things like cracking jokes having a good time. It also shows the positive things that Hitler did for Germany, and it shows normal, everyday people in Nazi Germany who appear to be genuinely happy and content with the Nazi lifestyle. </p>

<p>The reality is that if Hitler were around a century earlier and did the exact same thing as he did now, he&#39;d be compared to Napoleon, and people would probably view him in a similar light. </p>

<p>However, Zionists knew that in order to create Israel, they needed to take advantage of the situation and exaggerate every possible claim in order to create support for Israel. Israel would not even exist right now if it weren&#39;t for the story of the Holocaust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that Americans are not cool with one leader who started a war of aggression against many countries baffles my mind as we&#39;re ok with multiple leaders within our own borders doing the same thing. I guess if Hitler had flown the &quot;humanitarian&quot; and &quot;for our safety&quot; flag, he would get a posthumous Nobel Peace Prize. Seems like some leaders learned from his PR mistakes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never had any problem with 9/11 truth; it was a shock alright but I never had any political opinions one way or the other. I always ridiculed the Moon Landing Hoax until I actually looked into it myself. Nothing in the conspiracy lore prepared me for the emotional breakdown I experienced when examining the historicity of the Holocaust. The official narrative is so deeply ingrained in our education, you immediately cross over into some dark places when looking at alternative points of view of WW2. It&#39;s actually illegal in many countries.</p>

<p>But the truth is not some nice neat abstraction that you can talk to people about over supper; it is a vile poison that will make you into a monster if you&#39;re not careful, and will certainly make you seem like a monster to the rest of humanity. The world becomes a lot less enjoyable when you actually start to entertain these ideas with an honest open-mind, and it becomes difficult to believe in anything anymore without losing your mind. There is an emotional block that keeps people from exploring the truth, and has nothing to do with logic, intellect, or information access.</p>

<p>Just look at who you&#39;re not allowed to criticize and how long they&#39;ve been at it. How does a tiny race of people own and control so much in this world?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to admit, I find Hitler impressive.</p>

<p>I mean .. he was a complete failure up until WW1.  All talk.  You would have pegged him as someone who would never amount to anything.  He didn&#39;t come from money.  He didn&#39;t get any connections from attending university.  He went into the War pretty much a blank slate.  There was every indication that he would be <em>exactly</em> the type to not last a month.</p>

<p>But he excelled.  And survived until the end.  And by this point his one true gift that you <em>could</em> say he had .. this crazy messianic charisma .. hadn&#39;t even come into play!  So whatever else you want to say about him, he pulled his shit together enough to go, in 4 years, from being a failed nearly-homeless painter to coming out of the War with 2 Iron Crosses.  Respect.  No?</p>

<p>And from that point he established himself as a public speaker.  He was able to impress everyone from farmers to politicians with his words.  And the rest is history.  But I don&#39;t think that he was in it for &quot;himself&quot;.  He really was delusional to believe he was an instrument of destiny for Germany. On a mission.  He had a completely different moral compass. Obviously&lt;sarc&gt; the universe is full of &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot;.  Individual lives were unimportant in the &quot;bigger picture&quot;.  Germany&#39;s time has come!  etc etc etc.</p>

<p>He was a sociopath, and brought a whole lot of pain.  But I really think he was the good guy in his little delusion world.  He was devoting his life to what he truly believed was a better world.  He was crazy, no doubt, but not crazy enough to be obviously insane and be institutionalized.  And he certainly did exemplify the &quot;power of will&quot;.  He pretty much &quot;willed himself&quot; from damn near bottom to being one of the most talked about figures in history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are not many universal truths that transcend peoples, periods and circumstances. We all do however have a desire to win, but at what cost? Usually, this self-limiting point comes about at some point where our desire to win is limited when we fear our own very real personal danger of being killed. Hero, is term that&#39;s thrown around for accomplished individuals, most significantly in sport, but they clearly have no danger to themselves. It&#39;s overuse is really away of the masses to be comfortable in themselves, but that&#39;s another story.

<p><strong>SOME PEOPLE BROWSE REDDIT ON PUBLIC COMPUTERS</strong></p>

<p>Nothing will make a new user hit the back button faster than a giant picture of hitler on their screen in a library.  It might as well be tubgirl</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying at all.</p>

<p>In this case it&#39;s poisoning the well and it doesn&#39;t need to be done.  </p>

<p>I have nothing against the documentary.  I haven&#39;t seen it but I support it&#39;s right to exist and anyone that wants to promote it.  You can do that without putting giant picture of hitler on every page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>It makes it look like it&#39;s our logo, and comes off as an endorsement.  It has a shock value and people will exit the page within seconds.  <strong>It has the same effect as porn or gore</strong>.</p>

<p>Again I am fine with an indepth discussion of any detail of WWII.   This sub should be all about open dialog.  We don&#39;t need hitler&#39;s face to do that.  Plastering every page of the sub with nazi logos does more harm than good.</p>

<p><strong>I propose this alternative</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  It must be sad living such a sheltered life that a graphic representation of a historical figure offends you.  It&#39;s your fault for being offended not <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> s.  Take a step back and realize that you have a choice to avoid what offends you and your or anybody else&#39;s offense has no right to dictate what kind or type of information is disseminated in a public forum.  <strong>There is no such thing as a right to not be offended.</strong>  Deal with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re scared of what some stranger passing you by in the library is going to think, all because there is a <em>drawing</em> of a representation of Adolf Hitler on the sidebar?  Grow a pair.</p>

<p>And that somehow makes it the responsibility of <em>everyone else</em> to ensure that everything is nice and rated-PG for the users who are on public computers??  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re on a public computer, it&#39;s your fucking responsibility to browse with care.</p>

<p>And comparing a picture of Hitler to tubgirl?  Holy fuck.  Maybe you should just turn the computer off, go back home, and spend your day coloring with crayons.</p>

<p>It was designed to be several different things. Satire, propaganda, reverse propaganda.... </p>

<p>So what is actually important to you? It can&#39;t be the intent behind the film.</p>
