       The current AmA isn't even from a Holocaust survivor. The guy never spent a single day in a concentration camp. Just because you were a Jew during the time doesn't mean you survived the Holocaust.

        During the war, our family was forced to move into the Warsaw Ghetto, with with my mother's parents, across the street from the infamous Pawiak prison. As the Nazis began liquidating the Ghetto in late 1942, sending inmates to the Treblinka death camp, we were able to escape to the Christian side and remain in hiding. My father was tragically caught and presumed murdered. My mother and I were liberated by the allies in the spring of 1945.

       The Holocaust in definition is the mass slaughter of people. If he was not part of the mass slaughter of people, or in the process of being slaughtered, he was not a survivor of the Holocaust, he was a survivor of the war. I'm sorry, the guys ordeal was cruel but he holds himself in the same regard as a man who was stamped and in process to be gassed and burned and I find that wrong.

       That's fair, it just seems like your definition of a holocaust survivor is strictly someone who was about to be slaughtered and then escaped. I don't really agree because it's arguable that all Jews were in the process of being slaughtered. But you have a right to your opinion.

       This is a fascinating thread.  Is the crime in the killing or in the intent to kill?  Hypothetically, is a target still a victim if he escapes relatively unscathed?  As I understand it the Warsaw Ghetto was a bit like a "camp" of sorts.  Do you equate a "concentration camp" with a "death camp"?  It seems that the stereotypical "believer" does but the stereotypical "non-believer" does not.

       Yes, these particular survivors were taken out of their homes and subjected to being split away and taken from their friends/family and thrown into houses with abhorrent conditions, before managing to escape a likely death.  What exactly are you trying to accomplish by taking away from this very unfortunate fact?

       I guess when you live somewhere with a government that won't listen or acknowledge that they are committing the same atrocities now- maybe telling your story so the world and your own countrymen can see the parallels is the best way to prevent it from happening to another group of people. So I applaud them for their efforts, and since they lived through it no one will call them anti-Semitic for criticizing the Israeli govt.

       Most have been critical of israel and it's actions in the middle east.  They probably just want to tell their story.  Of course only here does that mean it's propaganda and the revisionists start foaming at the mouth.  I assume if a jewish person does an ama about being a rabbi you'd probably call that propaganda too right?

       Probably JIDF organized propaganda. The mods probably aren't going to ask many questions. If you push too hard for proof, they'll just call you an anti-Semite holocaust denier, and none of them want that.

       We already know the Reddit admins have been compromised by outside forces, Snowden proved this. Given this knowledge, it's not hard to imagine that many Admins on this site are either JIDF sympathizers or are fully cooperating with them wholesale and creating these fake "Holocaust" survivor AmA's so we don't focus on Palestine.

       Everyone has their own idea of what "reputable" means, so I'm not going to debate that.  Regardless of the source, I think at the end of the day you have to decide for yourself whether the conclusions stand to reason or not....  Anyway if you care to look into it, here are some videos I found that draw alternate conclusions.  Don't assume I endorse it or agree with any or all of it.  Please remember the sidebar at right says "This is a forum for free thinking ....  Respect other views and opinions, keep an open mind."  Keep searching for truth; be wary of those who claim to have found it.  Sometimes it's more about the journey than the destination.

       The thought you meant the other less used definition of myth crossed my mind before posting. Being in the sub it is in I thought screw it I'll post it anyway. I am intellectually capable of understanding what you meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       However a few comments down you say that there really is no proof of "homicidal gas chambers or of German orders to do it". So
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is what I am demanding proof for. You present claims that run opposite of the accepted narrative.
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       must be intellectually unable to understand what I am saying. You can't say to me that some of it is stretched truth and thy that it may not have played out like it did and then dismiss it to someone else later. So yes I still would like some sort of reputable proof to prop up your claims. I will read it. Who knows, maybe it will be compelling and change mind. I'm open to it. But I bet you don't have any or won't respond.

       Why demand proof all the time. You will undoubtedly find a reason not to even read it or just not care.

      <p>
       You made your mind up. As did the person you demand your proof from. The story that is told is full of holes. When I went to school it was 6 million killed now its a bit over a million. So wtf. Get the epic story right before telling it.

       Did bad shit happen sure... so what. Not one thing changed but the Jewish community gets the infinite get out of jail free card. Fuck that.  Worse atrocities have been commited like my ancestors. Being native american its appalling the shit that isnt tought about in schools and read about in books.
      </p>

       Your knowledge prolly ends with the trail of tears. While it was bad they were FORCED for one place to another without reason or means. All over this continent then made to change names and disavow heritage and culture for survival.

       I find it a money making enterprise that the jewish community has capitalized on. Native americans have given up as a community. A sad and simple truth that shows in todays society as we are viewed as drunken scabs that dwell on the outskirts of civilization.

       Its all propaganda.  Everything we encounter thru media. You dont see that? What does it matter where it is from or who it is for?
      </p>
      <p>
       What amazes me the most is how people fall into these demands for proof all the time. I am 99.9999% sure the one demanding the proof never reads it, as most the time they dont respond. Then if they do it is to counter with another article that sheds it in a better way.
      </p>
      <p>
       No everything we intake is skewed so unless you are there then you will never know what happened. Take the Westgate mall massacre. That was a year ago this week. How much is the media talking about it? None that I have seen but havent been watching really. I know I didnt see it on front page or in any subs. So I am pretty sure that was a real act of terrorism because they cant spin it into some kinda bullshit about things that will benifit the 1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont consider myself a conspiracy theorist any more. Because it has such a negitive connotation.  The media does it so now I will as we all should. Truthers has a bad thing now too. Soon survivalist will. Its every movement that infers the idea  of independent thinking or self reliance is vilified anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you keep thinking this place is grand and great those of us that are able to see the signs of a storm will prepare.

      <p>
       It matters more than anything where it comes from. The ability to think critically is badly served by the eternally doubting nature of the idea that "it's all propaganda". That's not to say that perfectly unbiased sources exist, that's naive. However, having a decent ifea of who's saying what and why allows you to read from plenty of sources and evaluate their relative worth. I'm amazed at how often totally (IMO) rubbish sources get posted here. Crappy unsourced YouTube videos, state-controlled media like RT or PressTV, stuff like that

        What amazes me the most is how people fall into these demands for proof all the time. I am 99.9999% sure the one demanding the proof never reads it, as most the time they dont respond. Then if they do it is to counter with another article that sheds it in a better way.

       I disagree on that, heavily. I try not to "demand proof", instead ask for sources. That does not go over very well at all. Look at the conversation we're having now. Plenty of posters respond to sources. Plenty of other posters insult, patronise and denigrate people asking, too. I appreciate this is the kind of place where not everything has to be sourced and fotnoted, of course, but there's an awful lot of crazy talk being stated as pure fact instead of opinion or even educated guessing.

       That's kind of a give-up-and-go-home message.

        Take the Westgate mall massacre. That was a year ago this week. How much is the media talking about it? None that I have seen but havent been watching really. I know I didnt see it on front page or in any subs. So I am pretty sure that was a real act of terrorism because they cant spin it into some kinda bullshit about things that will benifit the 1%.

       I've seen plenty of coverage of that on BBC World News, some in the newspapers, but not a whole lot. Granted, not as much as if it had happened in Helsinki or Wilmington, but that's a byproduct of English-language, Europe/North-America based media, which historically underserves African stories and interests.. It's not a conspiracy of "the 1%" that there's relatively less coverage of this than the current action in Syria &amp; Iraq. One of these events is closer to the interests of the consumers. Also, the world is a happenin' place at the minute, It is the very opposite of a slow news year, conflict-wise.

        I dont consider myself a conspiracy theorist any more. Because it has such a negitive connotation.  The media does it so now I will as we all should. Truthers has a bad thing now too. Soon survivalist will. Its every movement that infers the idea  of independent thinking or self reliance is vilified anymore.

       Subreddits like this don't help. I used to be, and I suposse I still am in the historical sense. I don't like the way this sub deals with current events, because I don't believe doubt to be a legitimate philosophical position.

       The reason I said that is from when the truckers strike in dc happened. I was there and didnt see any of the posts people were making in here about it. I drove the loop where they were supposed to be for 2 hours in both directions. Never saw any of the scenes that others were posting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted pics of my location many times and wasn't even responded too... matter of fact my submissions were deleted twice. The whole of this sub was all yeah god job way to show them in dc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posters of this sub sometimes are better then the media at distorting the truth of the articles they are posting. In all honesty I find most the time they are worse in here then they are on tv.
      </p>
      <p>
       That day I gave up on conspiracy theorists.  I picked up a new hobby as you can tell from my screen name. I found the mentality of this sub was making me a bitter person. So I said fuck it and am not active as much as I used to be.

       Key to happiness is staying level headed in life. You seem very rational that is good. I have made up my mind that shit wont change in my lifetime. I can only hope to educate my son with real history and events. Schools are failing to do that with txt book omissions and promoting pacifism.

       I know shit isnt told to us at this level. We 've bits and pieces of info but never the whole story.

       I was struck that he kept mentioning animal rights.  I mean I largely agree with the ethics of that, but I kept wondering where's he going with that?.  An emotive plea?  Whitewashing?  More laws ostensibly to legislate morality?  Controlling the food supply?  Another resource grab? Why can't he talk about one issue at a time?  Why draw a parallel between humans and animals?  Are they trying to portray humans as animals?  Is this an elitist thing?  A reptilian thing? (No I don't mean alien shape-shifting).  Is it to foment nihilism, guilt, evoke the idea of (Christian) original sin?
