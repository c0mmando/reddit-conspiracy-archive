    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>During the war, our family was forced to move into the Warsaw Ghetto, with with my mother&#39;s parents, across the street from the infamous Pawiak prison. As the Nazis began liquidating the Ghetto in late 1942, sending inmates to the Treblinka death camp, we were able to escape to the Christian side and remain in hiding. My father was tragically caught and presumed murdered. My mother and I were liberated by the allies in the spring of 1945.</p>

If he was not part of the mass slaughter of people, or in the process of being slaughtered, he was not a survivor of the Holocaust, he was a survivor of the war.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair, it just seems like your definition of a holocaust survivor is strictly someone who was about to be slaughtered and then escaped. I don&#39;t really agree because it&#39;s arguable that all Jews were in the process of being slaughtered. But you have a right to your opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a fascinating thread.  Is the crime in the killing or in the intent to kill?  Hypothetically, is a target still a victim if he escapes relatively unscathed?  As I understand it the Warsaw Ghetto was a bit like a &quot;camp&quot; of sorts.  Do you equate a &quot;concentration camp&quot; with a &quot;death camp&quot;?  It seems that the stereotypical &quot;believer&quot; does but the stereotypical &quot;non-believer&quot; does not.  </p>

Regardless of the source, I think at the end of the day you have to decide for yourself whether the conclusions stand to reason or not....

<p>However a few comments down you say that there really is no proof of &quot;homicidal gas chambers or of German orders to do it&quot;. So <em>that</em> is what I am demanding proof for. You present claims that run opposite of the accepted narrative. <em>You</em> must be intellectually unable to understand what I am saying. You can&#39;t say to me that some of it is stretched truth and thy that it may not have played out like it did and then dismiss it to someone else later. So yes I still would like some sort of reputable proof to prop up your claims. I will read it. Who knows, maybe it will be compelling and change mind. I&#39;m open to it.

    <div class="md"><p>Why demand proof all the time. You will undoubtedly find a reason not to even read it or just not care. </p>

<p>You made your mind up. As did the person you demand your proof from. The story that is told is full of holes. When I went to school it was 6 million killed now its a bit over a million. So wtf. Get the epic story right before telling it. </p>

<p>Did bad shit happen sure... so what. Not one thing changed but the Jewish community gets the infinite get out of jail free card. Fuck that.  Worse atrocities have been commited like my ancestors. Being native american its appalling the shit that isnt tought about in schools and read about in books. </p>

<p>Your knowledge prolly ends with the trail of tears. While it was bad they were FORCED for one place to another without reason or means. All over this continent then made to change names and disavow heritage and culture for survival.  </p>

<p>No fuck your proof. And fuck all the waaa waaa my pussy hurts cause we have more money to spread our lies because we looted our neighbors and made banks killed our own for a buck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the way the Native Americans were treated was awful. It should be taught. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what we are talking about here though. It sounds like you are butt hurt and also hate Jews. I asked for evidence and one person provided YouTube videos that I do plan on watching. So no, not fuck my proof, fuck your stupid denialism. </p>

<p><em>Evidence</em> is what I asked for and in this case the burden is on you to provide it. If it&#39;s provided I will check it out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Butt hurt? Really that is the phrase you really want to use? </p>

<p>I dont hate anyone it takes too much time from the things I enjoy. You are incapable of understanding such a thing I see. </p>

<p>I find it a money making enterprise that the jewish community has capitalized on. Native americans have given up as a community. A sad and simple truth that shows in todays society as we are viewed as drunken scabs that dwell on the outskirts of civilization. </p>

<p>For you to say they were treated awful is an understatement of epic proportions. </p>

<p>It matters more than anything where it comes from. The ability to think critically is badly served by the eternally doubting nature of the idea that &quot;it&#39;s all propaganda&quot;. That&#39;s not to say that perfectly unbiased sources exist, that&#39;s naive. However, having a decent ifea of who&#39;s saying what and why allows you to read from plenty of sources and evaluate their relative worth. I&#39;m amazed at how often totally (IMO) rubbish sources get posted here. Crappy unsourced YouTube videos, state-controlled media like RT or PressTV, stuff like that</p>

<p>I disagree on that, heavily. I try not to &quot;demand proof&quot;, instead ask for sources. That does not go over very well at all. Look at the conversation we&#39;re having now. Plenty of posters respond to sources. Plenty of other posters insult, patronise and denigrate people asking, too. I appreciate this is the kind of place where not everything has to be sourced and fotnoted, of course, but there&#39;s an awful lot of crazy talk being stated as pure fact instead of opinion or even educated guessing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s kind of a give-up-and-go-home message. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of coverage of that on BBC World News, some in the newspapers, but not a whole lot. Granted, not as much as if it had happened in Helsinki or Wilmington, but that&#39;s a byproduct of English-language, Europe/North-America based media, which historically underserves African stories and interests.. It&#39;s not a conspiracy of &quot;the 1%&quot; that there&#39;s relatively less coverage of this than the current action in Syria &amp; Iraq. One of these events is closer to the interests of the consumers. Also, the world is a happenin&#39; place at the minute, It is the very opposite of a slow news year, conflict-wise.</p>

<p>Subreddits like this don&#39;t help. I used to be, and I suposse I still am in the historical sense. I don&#39;t like the way this sub deals with current events, because I don&#39;t believe doubt to be a legitimate philosophical position.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am on a phone so the quotes are not gonna happen lol.</p>

<p>Sorry if I came across as a dick. The give up or go home comment isnt fair.</p>

<p>The reason I said that is from when the truckers strike in dc happened. I was there and didnt see any of the posts people were making in here about it. I drove the loop where they were supposed to be for 2 hours in both directions. Never saw any of the scenes that others were posting. </p>

<p>I posted pics of my location many times and wasn&#39;t even responded too... matter of fact my submissions were deleted twice. The whole of this sub was all yeah god job way to show them in dc. </p>

<p>Posters of this sub sometimes are better then the media at distorting the truth of the articles they are posting. In all honesty I find most the time they are worse in here then they are on tv. </p>

<p>That day I gave up on conspiracy theorists.  I picked up a new hobby as you can tell from my screen name. I found the mentality of this sub was making me a bitter person. So I said fuck it and am not active as much as I used to be. </p>

<p>Key to happiness is staying level headed in life. You seem very rational that is good. I have made up my mind that shit wont change in my lifetime. I can only hope to educate my son with real history and events. Schools are failing to do that with txt book omissions and promoting pacifism. </p>

<p>I know shit isnt told to us at this level. We &#39;ve bits and pieces of info but never the whole story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was struck that he kept mentioning animal rights.  I mean I largely agree with the ethics of that, but I kept wondering where&#39;s he going with that?.  An emotive plea?  Whitewashing?  More laws ostensibly to legislate morality?  Controlling the food supply?  Another resource grab? Why can&#39;t he talk about one issue at a time?  Why draw a parallel between humans and animals?  Are they trying to portray humans as animals?  Is this an elitist thing?  A reptilian thing? (No I don&#39;t mean alien shape-shifting).  Is it to foment nihilism, guilt, evoke the idea of (Christian) original sin?  </p>
