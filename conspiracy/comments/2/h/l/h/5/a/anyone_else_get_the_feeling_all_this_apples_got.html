       It very well could be on the up-and-up, but everyone should have healthy skepticism. The whole protest by the FBI seems like a bit much.  Why would they draw more attention to the fact that you could partially evade search?

       I'll believe it once it's been field tested over time.

       To be fair, we're buying the iCloud excuse at face value. It could easily have been leaked from NSA employee treasure troves, but make Apple the fall guy. Clear example being the Kim photos with her taking them with a BlackBerry.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same vein I'd say these tech companies have been coerced into these backdoor dealings. They know the wrath of the government if they don't comply (see Yahoo's battle).
      </p>
      <p>
       Their only way to stop it is to remove their own ability to access user content. This is exactly what the iOS 8 change to no longer store encryption keys is about. Same thing with end to end encryption on iMessage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tech companies are trying (some more than others) to regain user trust and privacy, but are battling the agencies.

       I don't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that NSA employees accessed the nudes without the NSAs blessing, using the NSAs tools.  And I believe the icloud was the fall guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       These complaints by the agencies about being unable to access the iOS8 data is the price that apple demanded to take the fall.

       I don't know, Snowden mentioned this exact behaviour going on before these events. He didn't mention celebrities specifically but definitely mentioned lewd photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even still, I could see this being an NSA plot to make people beg for regulation and identification on the internet. I think we all can see how those in power fear the information available on the internet and how quickly it spreads.

       Apple has to make a show of locking out the NSA if they want to sell their products internationally.  I'm skeptical about their technology being secure, time will tell though.  I'm betting there is a back door or the tech has an Achilles Heel.

       Not even Apple at this point with iOS 8. They are no longer storing encryption keys on their servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also why iMessage is important, it's encrypted end to end. So the carriers cannot intercept them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could argue on the trueness of end to end encryption but the theory is that it's far more secure than standard SMS.

       Give it 5 or 6 years &amp; I'm certain audio recorded in secret will surface showing direct collaboration between the NSA &amp; both of these corporations discussing how to win back the minds/hearts of the disenfranchised. Had they of never given over access to our privacy a smoke screen attempt to regain favor wouldn't be necessary. It's funny how actions have consequences.

       I find this move by Apple, and Google, to encrypt users' data as suspicious.  Remember, a lot of the apps in the Apple/Google app stores ask permission to see your txt, call list, contacts etc so that information can then be sold for money.  Without this revenue stream a lot of apps wouldn't have a way to make money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The encryption still may work, but I believe that this is a way for Apple and Google to consolidate their control over the users' data to box out their competition.  If a lot of apps no longer have a way to make money off of that data without having the key only Apple/Google can make that money.  OR the encryption is shit, and at the time of install all the permissions given to the app can get around the encryption.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the interesting part to me: how will this affect the app companies, Facebook, Twitter, who want that data.  Wonder if anyone has an answer?

       Bottom line is that they have a black box and they are telling us to trust them, it's secure. Not buying it.

       Open source can create a false sense of security too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the two most recent issues: Heartbleed (OpenSSL) and Bash. Both of these exploits existed for years and were in open source projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, who's to say the Hearthbleed exploit wasn't planted by someone in a government agency in order to create a backdoor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not dogging open source but to say it's the answer is a bit untrue. You can have insidious contributors.

       You're right in that it's not a cure-all. But at least you have a shot at finding the holes rather than simply trusting Microsoft or Apple to not dick you over.

       quite simple:
      </p>
      <p>
       apple makes its business with your data.
      </p>
      <p>
       And cutting off their acess to your data is equal to going full retard.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yea: Apple and google are suspicious to no end, but at least apple is so fucking expensive and has such a cloud of fanboys that they could shoulder the lost money from not having acess to your data.
