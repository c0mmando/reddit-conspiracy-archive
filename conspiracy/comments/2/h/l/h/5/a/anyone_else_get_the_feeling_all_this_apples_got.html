    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, we&#39;re buying the iCloud excuse at face value. It could easily have been leaked from NSA employee treasure troves, but make Apple the fall guy. Clear example being the Kim photos with her taking them with a BlackBerry.</p>

<p>In the same vein I&#39;d say these tech companies have been coerced into these backdoor dealings. They know the wrath of the government if they don&#39;t comply (see Yahoo&#39;s battle).</p>

<p>Their only way to stop it is to remove their own ability to access user content. This is exactly what the iOS 8 change to no longer store encryption keys is about. Same thing with end to end encryption on iMessage.</p>

<p>The tech companies are trying (some more than others) to regain user trust and privacy, but are battling the agencies.</p>

<p>I believe that NSA employees accessed the nudes without the NSAs blessing, using the NSAs tools.  And I believe the icloud was the fall guy. </p>

<p>These complaints by the agencies about being unable to access the iOS8 data is the price that apple demanded to take the fall.</p>

<p>Even still, I could see this being an NSA plot to make people beg for regulation and identification on the internet. I think we all can see how those in power fear the information available on the internet and how quickly it spreads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even Apple at this point with iOS 8. They are no longer storing encryption keys on their servers.</p>

<p>This is also why iMessage is important, it&#39;s encrypted end to end. So the carriers cannot intercept them.</p>

<p>We could argue on the trueness of end to end encryption but the theory is that it&#39;s far more secure than standard SMS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this move by Apple, and Google, to encrypt users&#39; data as suspicious.  Remember, a lot of the apps in the Apple/Google app stores ask permission to see your txt, call list, contacts etc so that information can then be sold for money.  Without this revenue stream a lot of apps wouldn&#39;t have a way to make money.</p>

<p>The encryption still may work, but I believe that this is a way for Apple and Google to consolidate their control over the users&#39; data to box out their competition.  If a lot of apps no longer have a way to make money off of that data without having the key only Apple/Google can make that money.  OR the encryption is shit, and at the time of install all the permissions given to the app can get around the encryption.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the interesting part to me: how will this affect the app companies, Facebook, Twitter, who want that data.  Wonder if anyone has an answer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Open source can create a false sense of security too.</p>

<p>Look at the two most recent issues: Heartbleed (OpenSSL) and Bash. Both of these exploits existed for years and were in open source projects.</p>

<p>Also, who&#39;s to say the Hearthbleed exploit wasn&#39;t planted by someone in a government agency in order to create a backdoor.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not dogging open source but to say it&#39;s the answer is a bit untrue. You can have insidious contributors.</p>

<p>apple makes its business with your data. </p>

<p>And cutting off their acess to your data is equal to going full retard. </p>

<p>So yea: Apple and google are suspicious to no end, but at least apple is so fucking expensive and has such a cloud of fanboys that they could shoulder the lost money from not having acess to your data. </p>
