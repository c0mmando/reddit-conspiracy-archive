<p>Somebody in NK could do themselves and the world a favour by putting a pillow over the face of KJ3.</p>

<p>NK with a new govt that is non hostile and compatible with the modenr world, they could see modern 20thC conditions in NK within five years, 21stC ones in ten.</p>

<p>if KJ3 passes peacefully in his sleep, the world would happily go along with a charade that it was all the KimJons fault for the last 50 years.</p>

<p>China and the West and SK would happily pump billions into NK if their regime transform into a modern govt compatible with the world.</p>

<p>Swords into ploughshares etc, thats just the minimum benefits of peace.</p>

<p>One pillow and one TV message to the world, thats all it would take.</p>

<p>probabilities and evaluation and experience.</p>

<p>examine evidence,news, reports and ideas, reject the obviously wrong and misleading shit, reject or sideline the stupid, weigh up whever a story or report has an agenda, is that agenda worthwhile or stupid or just.</p>

<p>take a drink and respond, and add to the stupidity or to the collective news and views.</p>

<p>if somebody follows a rational approach to anything, its pretty easy to reject UFO, bigfoot, aliens and similar ghost and religious stuff. they are cultural memes and stories, amusing sometimes, mostly stupid, sometimes a perspective on social trends and of interest to people who follow anthropology issues.</p>

<p>some stories and approaches to social economic and political issues are also silly, but often its all in the eye of the beholder.</p>

<p>up to the individual person to read and evaluate their personal view on news and life.</p>

<p>Tabloid newspaper and magazine are generally regarded as garbage by most thinking peoples, BUT they provide employment for people, people buy and read them AND enjoy reading them, they are important to those people, and they have a cultural impact on society, for good or bad is debatable, but they exist as a part of society.</p>

<p>Not saying NK is anything great or even good, but what&#39;s keeping you from thinking that they wouldn&#39;t be besieged by western multinational corporations if their own dictator was gone?  Once the manipulation from western corporations comes in, I can almost guarantee you that things will actually go from &quot;not great&quot; in NK to &quot;downright <em>bad</em>&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with peace, but not murder.</p>

<p>I want to ask you this, could you press the pillow? Or better yet, could you pull the trigger?</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;ve served forces, maybe you have taken lives, and believe/d it was for the greater good, or your own survival and that of your brothers, maybe you haven&#39;t, but <em>I,</em> have not, so I cannot, and will not.</p>

<p>Now I am of the &quot;fight the war, not the warrior&quot; type of mind, but I asked myself, If I am to have an opinion on <em>any</em> war, I should consider what it would be like to actually participate in it, on one side or the other. But because of my personal situation, that is difficult. Additionally, I don&#39;t know if I could take a life without feeling a thing, take it out of self-preservation, and later be fucked up for life, or not at all, go into fetal position and most likely later commit suicide. I&#39;m also not sure what it&#39;s like to be bombed to shit but I doubt it&#39;s enjoyable. So I can&#39;t in good faith sign off on risking <em>anyone</em> to experience the same trauma.</p>

<p>Same goes for even a single man or woman, no matter how vile, whose lifespan extinguished by political motivation may or may not prevent more violence.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as &quot;just war&quot;, assassination <em>is</em> an act of war, and NK would definitely retaliate.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>like I said, China and the West and SK would be happy if NK opened up, its not in our interest to invade or impose change on them, its up to NK to make the first move. we have fed and given them money to keep them peaceful over decades, lots of historical baggage from the Korean war/conflict, the world has moved on, no sane reason for NK to be as hostile or suspicious as they were decades past.</p>

<p>China changed from the days of Mao and the gang of four, Vietnam changed from their war economy and survival govt, Nk could change, the NK leader/govt that opens up would be forever remembered as heroes in NK.</p>

<p>From what I understand *(which ain&#39;t much and is probably biased) if anyone in NK were to do as you suggest, the civilians are understandably too scared shitless, nor could they get the opportunity so it would have to be someone close, and I think anyone like that are too loyal and probably hate the west just as much they&#39;re associates.</p>

<p>You perceive things through your <strong>EXTREMELY BIASED WESTERN FILTER</strong>, what you see as a problem might not be one for them. Perhaps colorful bankers are more problematic to them than living a simple and medieval life, such that they are willing to accept a dictatorship (especially seeing as it&#39;s the most proven way to keep capital outside the borders and guarantee national integrity).</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious, i would board a plane for NK tomorrow if i could.</p>
