       KimJon3 is too young to have a Kimjong 4 in waiting to take over the dynasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somebody in NK could do themselves and the world a favour by putting a pillow over the face of KJ3.
      </p>
      <p>
       NK with a new govt that is non hostile and compatible with the modenr world, they could see modern 20thC conditions in NK within five years, 21stC ones in ten.
      </p>
      <p>
       if KJ3 passes peacefully in his sleep, the world would happily go along with a charade that it was all the KimJons fault for the last 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       China and the West and SK would happily pump billions into NK if their regime transform into a modern govt compatible with the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Swords into ploughshares etc, thats just the minimum benefits of peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       One pillow and one TV message to the world, thats all it would take.

       Why can't you let other countries be? Where are you from? How is your country any better for you?  Live and let live. This isn't the place for your radical and poorly conceived thoughts. Fat lot of good all the billions did to iraq afghanistan ukraine myanmar etc. Have you been the north korea? Spoken to all their people? Do you know anything about human rights abuses in china america india or any? You know nothing jon snow.

       This a perfect platform to really discuss the agenda. This rhetoric is old. Like how people said cuba was bad, libya was bad, iraq was bad and to an extent they were but how are they better off now? Intervention from outside won't help. When the people revolt help them. Don't force or coerce them. Our idea about north Korea cannot be totally accurate right?

       if somebody follows a rational approach to anything, its pretty easy to reject UFO, bigfoot, aliens and similar ghost and religious stuff. they are cultural memes and stories, amusing sometimes, mostly stupid, sometimes a perspective on social trends and of interest to people who follow anthropology issues.

       Tabloid newspaper and magazine are generally regarded as garbage by most thinking peoples, BUT they provide employment for people, people buy and read them AND enjoy reading them, they are important to those people, and they have a cultural impact on society, for good or bad is debatable, but they exist as a part of society.

       Not saying NK is anything great or even good, but what's keeping you from thinking that they wouldn't be besieged by western multinational corporations if their own dictator was gone?  Once the manipulation from western corporations comes in, I can almost guarantee you that things will actually go from "not great" in NK to "downright

       I want to ask you this, could you press the pillow? Or better yet, could you pull the trigger?
      </p>
      <p>

       Now I am of the "fight the war, not the warrior" type of mind, but I asked myself, If I am to have an opinion on
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       war, I should consider what it would be like to actually participate in it, on one side or the other. But because of my personal situation, that is difficult. Additionally, I don't know if I could take a life without feeling a thing, take it out of self-preservation, and later be fucked up for life, or not at all, go into fetal position and most likely later commit suicide. I'm also not sure what it's like to be bombed to shit but I doubt it's enjoyable. So I can't in good faith sign off on risking
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       to experience the same trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for even a single man or woman, no matter how vile, whose lifespan extinguished by political motivation may or may not prevent more violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no such thing as "just war", assassination
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an act of war, and NK would definitely retaliate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?

       history is full of accounts of countries transforming by the beloved leader peacefully passing in their sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       its up to them. its their choice, decades of more of the same, or THEM changing and coming into the modern world.
      </p>
      <p>
       like I said, China and the West and SK would be happy if NK opened up, its not in our interest to invade or impose change on them, its up to NK to make the first move. we have fed and given them money to keep them peaceful over decades, lots of historical baggage from the Korean war/conflict, the world has moved on, no sane reason for NK to be as hostile or suspicious as they were decades past.
      </p>
      <p>
       China changed from the days of Mao and the gang of four, Vietnam changed from their war economy and survival govt, Nk could change, the NK leader/govt that opens up would be forever remembered as heroes in NK.

       Yeah I understood you weren't advocating for intervention, should've made that clearer, I was just addressing the greater issue of war and wondered where everyone stands on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I understand *(which ain't much and is probably biased) if anyone in NK were to do as you suggest, the civilians are understandably too scared shitless, nor could they get the opportunity so it would have to be someone close, and I think anyone like that are too loyal and probably hate the west just as much they're associates.
      </p>

       I imagine there would also be a massive power struggle and it would get ugly, I think some outside meddling would go down.

       You perceive things through your

       , what you see as a problem might not be one for them. Perhaps colorful bankers are more problematic to them than living a simple and medieval life, such that they are willing to accept a dictatorship (especially seeing as it's the most proven way to keep capital outside the borders and guarantee national integrity).

       Well, I'll just say that I at least agree with you that it should be them that accomplish prosperity one way or another, rather then us getting involved. Peacefully rather than violently, as all revolutions should be.

       Sadly, I'm skeptical that they ever will, and somewhat convinced NATO will eventually forcefully intervene.
