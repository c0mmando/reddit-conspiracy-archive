    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/rule-shadows-psychology-power/">Rule from the Shadows: The Psychology of Power</a></p>

<p>This is an excellent, albeit brief, documentary outlining the history of the modern and hidden psychological manipulation techniques that has been utilized by persons of power since around WWI in America. It talks about how Gustave Le Bon, a 19th century French psychologist, influenced the ideas of people like Edward Bernays, Goebbels, Hitler and the like to more effectively apply sophisticated propaganda.</p>

<p>One of the things people may like is in how the narrator discusses possible solutions using these psychological weapons for good purposes in order to level the playing field against those in power. Many people are frustrated by the harshness of powerlessness and I think that the realization that there are methods to counteract the devices of the elites can create hope for true change. </p>

<p>&quot;2002 documentary about the April 2002 Venezuelan coup attempt which briefly deposed Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. A television crew from Ireland&#39;s national broadcaster, RTÉ happened to be recording a documentary about Chávez during the events of April 11, 2002. Shifting focus, they followed the events as they occurred. During their filming, the crew recorded images of the events that they say contradict explanations given by Chávez&#39;s opposition, the private media, the US State Department, and then White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. The documentary says that the coup was the result of a conspiracy between various old guard and anti-Chávez factions within Venezuela and the United States.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I think that your link is the best one due mainly to how recent it is. Things are moving so fast with regard to the end of our liberties that any new and unique insights or information are worth their weight in gold.</p>

<p>What a powerful message. What I like about Naomi Wolf the most is that she is a poster-child for someone who could easily fit comfortably into a niche of the wealthy, head-in-the-sand &quot;polite society&quot;, she&#39;s a well-to-do Jewish New Yorker with every incentive to just go work for a big marketing firm or think-tank or something of that nature, and instead she&#39;s crusading for the spirit of our founding fathers.</p>

<p>Great link!</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O133ppiVnWY">Arithmetic, Population and Energy - A Talk by Al Bartlett</a></p>

<p>The biggest conspiracy ever is the one the vast majority of our society has been complicit in since the introduction of fossil fuels exploded our world&#39;s population from a steady 1 billion to an utterly unsustainable 7 billion and growing - that is the paradigm of &quot;growing economies&quot; or the &quot;infinite growth paradigm.&quot;</p>

<p>Every day that this issue is side-stepped by pipe dreams that scientists will figure a way around our dependence on petroleum as an energy source and a raw material for finished products that we use endlessly in our everyday lives is one day less that we&#39;ll have to formulate and participate in a real solution.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of you recall the late Michael Ruppert, a big-time prophet of the collapse of our socioeconomic paradigm. Al Bartlett was one of his most critical references in the conclusions that he arrived at.</p>

<p>If you feel like Ruppert was the worst of the doom-sayers living on the fringes of society, please don&#39;t let that inhibit you from viewing the material that I&#39;ve linked... It is based on very simple arithmetic and cold hard facts, and he makes it very easy to - indeed, encourages you to - do the work yourself and come to a rational conclusion on your own.</p>

<p>The American Army&#39;s intrusion in Hollywood war films may surprise some. In fact, the U.S. Army secret services have had close ties with American filmmakers for several decades. The movie Top Gun, for instance, was filmed with the support and approval of the U.S. Army. There is even a special bureau, the Film Liaison Office, that oversees these issues for the Pentagon and the Capitol. It has a clear mission: studying the scripts of American war movies, deciding whether to offer them support or not, depending on their interest for the country&#39;s military leaders.</p>

<p>Scripts are cut and sometimes watered down. Characters are changed and historical truth, sometimes fudged. One director might be loaned combat jets and ships, and all their equipment, enabling him to shoot the scenes written by his scriptwriters. Another director, whose script displeases the army, may be refused any kind of support. That was the case for the film Platoon, deemed overly critical of the Vietnam War. It is then up to the producers to look for shooting locations and equipment outside the United States. Often, at considerable cost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or its documented proof of how certain member of the higher echelons of society like to let their hair down, so to speak. </p>

<p>The cremation of care play that they watch is not documented proof of occult rituals. It&#39;s symbolism of the whole event, &quot;ye who enters here leaves their cares at the door&quot;, hence the cremation of care. It&#39;s an old tradition, one that the likes of me and you probably don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>Remember, the elite often do not share the same past times as regular members of society does. So what may seem bizarre, or boring to me and you, might seem perfectly normal to them. </p>

<p>I just wouldn&#39;t jump to the conclusion that it&#39;s actual proof of occult rituals. It&#39;s more like Alex Jones&#39; interpretation of what he caught on film. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that is true to some extent. It&#39;s still interesting considering many of these people parade around like they&#39;re christians. They are self interested and self absorbed in their own rituals, whether it be skull and bones at yale, or the bohemian grove. It is a completely different set of beliefs and values, while the present themselves as average guys who are just making &quot;compromises&quot; in washington. The truth is they&#39;re all part of these clubs, ala &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, and operate on a completely different wavelength.</p>

<p>I try to imagine what it would be like to have your whole upbringing totally and utterly closed off from normal life. </p>

<p>Theses people naturally think of themselves as above the rest of society. They are bread for power plain and simple. </p>

<p>Politicians like the Neoconservatives are all students of Machiavelli, they know the importance of appearances and they probably don&#39;t believe in God themselves. But they no that religion is an excellent form of control and they no that they are more likely to see themselves in high office if they appear to believe in God. </p>

<p>With all the rituals that we hear about and the Skull and Bones society, Bohemian Grove, the Bullingdon Club at Oxford University in the UK, I think that&#39;s all part of making sure these people remain closed off. </p>

<p>Imagine if you were in that life and you had just enrolled at university and were invited to this exclusive club, and then you were humiliated and degraded in these dark obscene rituals. You would not want people to know about that. Maybe it gives them something to hold over you for the rest of your life. Keeps you in line. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not for everyone. I cannot remember which president it was (possible Richard Nixon), he was caught having a private conversation about how he hates the Bohemian Grove. He got a bit homophobic about the whole thing. The recording is on YouTube. </p>

<p>Found it, it was Nixon: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPb-PN9F2Pc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPb-PN9F2Pc</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. That recording shows obviously that lots of homosexual behavior goes on at BG. Not to mention pedophilia, like with the Jimmy Savile case. I believe some of them are gay, but many are just complete degenerates, and want to have blackmail over others while getting their rocks off. Either way, I think we&#39;re in agreement here. The elite are fucked in the head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=eaf_1382262528">Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told</a></p>

<p>This documentary is responsible for radically changing my worldview, more than any other film I&#39;ve ever seen. </p>

<p>I consider myself above all to be a history buff, conspiracy, trivia, popular culture, these things come after what I consider to be a very good grasp of history. When you find out that you have been lied to you, your entire life, about the events that occurred in World War II; you will feel completely betrayed/hoodwinked by US history or propaganda on the matter. The propaganda is so pervasive and saturating that you will not be able to get over the deception. There has never been a more 1-sided story told, than the story of Adolf Hitler. </p>

<p>Also as an added caveat, this documentary has the rare distinction of being so controversial that it was censored by YouTube &amp; Vimeo. </p>

<p>This documentary answers so many questions, and it portrays Hitler as being more than your usual psychopathic, power-hungry, raving anti-Semite. </p>

<p>If you really want to go down the rabbit hole, you have to watch this movie about the greatest conspiracy of all, the fact that our own history has been hijacked. The &#39;history&#39; that we are taught in our compulsory state-mandated education is nothing more than Ally propaganda, amplified by 70 years of documentaries &amp; Hollywood movies vilifying Hitler.</p>

<p>If you do decide to watch this documentary, just keep 2 very prescient quotes in mind beforehand:</p>

<p>“He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” </p>

<p>― George Orwell, 1984</p>

<p>&amp;</p>

<p>“History is written by the victors.”</p>

<p>― Winston Churchill</p>

<p>Also, take into account that in the 12 years of compulsory education that you receive in the US, you don&#39;t spend a single history lesson learning about World War II from a German perspective. In democratically electing Hitler, Germans are written off by Western historians as collectively being gripped by a national lunacy. My response to this method of 1-sided teaching of a subject as expansive is World War II is utter incredulity. How can you expect someone to know anything about a war, when they are only teaching 1-side of the issue ? </p>

<p>After you watch this movie, it will become apparent that we are all the victims of rampant historical revision. Everything that Hitler accomplished in a short amount of time, like lifting tens of millions of Germans out of dire poverty, has been effectively revised out of all the history books. Now, even if you are taking a college level history course, all that is taught about Hitler is that he was a raving racist. Not that his Chancellorship oversaw the most astonishing economic recovery in the history of human civilization. The fact that Hitler began issuing government-sanctioned currency and went around the fiat currency, central banking system that he saw as parasitic; was revolutionary. </p>

<p>The real reason the powers that be went after Hitler is because he sought to systemically change the banking system, he wanted to issue debt-free German currency from the central government. The powers behind international finance could not allow such a thing to occur as it would expose their parasitic, money as debt, fiat currency system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the tip. Started watching it. One wormwood though: I wish the makers of documentaries could get rid of their urge to constantly underly everything with music, especially dramatic and/or heroic classical stuff. This annoys the shit out of me and also makes it more difficult for me to understand many things since I am no native English speaker. Just because you <em>can</em> mix in music doesn&#39;t mean you <em>have to</em>.</p>

<p>Medan, Indonesia. When the government of Indonesia was overthrown by the military in 1965, Anwar and his friends were promoted from small-time gangsters who sold movie theatre tickets on the black market to death squad leaders. They helped the army kill more than one million alleged communists, ethnic Chinese, and intellectuals in less than a year. As the executioner for the most notorious death squad in his city, Anwar himself killed hundreds of people with his own hands.</p>

<p>Today, Anwar is revered as a founding father of a right-wing paramilitary organization that grew out of the death squads. The organization is so powerful that its leaders include government ministers, and they are happy to boast about everything from corruption and election rigging to acts of genocide.</p>
