<p>this attitude of superiority really does us no favors. it&#39;s not that people enjoy being lied too, it&#39;s that sifting through this mountain of abuse and greed and theft and murder is exhausting. it takes forever and it&#39;s depressing. </p>

<p>personally, I&#39;d rather have no part in this fight, I&#39;d much rather be on some college football forum right now complaining about LSUs defensive line and calling bama fans fags. I&#39;d much rather believe that the people we elect are basically trustworthy and well intentioned, even if I disagree with their policies. </p>

<p>but I know they&#39;re not. </p>

<p>even more than that, I have an irrational hatred for bullies. I&#39;ve always been big, physically, I&#39;m 6&#39;5&quot; 280 now, I don&#39;t like people being picked on, I hate the strong thinking they can take whatever they want from the weak, it enrages me, and I won&#39;t sit quietly as it happens. </p>

<p>but I don&#39;t blame others for simply trying to get through their day, to raise their kids, to live their lives, to spend what little free time they have on things that make them happy instead of angry. that is a very reasonable option. insulting those people is not gonna get them on our side.  </p>

<p>The act states that they may not prepare propaganda intended for US citizens, and they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>They have amended the act so that US citizens can request and view archival copies of prior broadcasts for specific purposes of research and education.</p>

<p>Article 2 says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Until this month, a vast ocean of U.S. programming produced by the Broadcasting Board of Governors such as Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks could only be viewed or listened to at broadcast quality in foreign countries. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is wrong, as anybody in the US with a radio has been able to listen to their radio broadcasts since 1944, when they started their Voice of America radio broadcasts.</p>

<p>They switched over to satellite in 1994, which again, could be viewed by any American Citizen with a satellite receiver capable of picking up the transmission.</p>

<p>Explain how the reform nullifies the act.</p>

<p>I got into a debate with another Redditor a while back about <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2a5l4u/us_military_studied_how_to_influence_twitter/cis2urg">how the changes could still be abused</a> to disseminate propaganda in the United States while staying within the letter of the law (but ignoring its spirit)... </p>

<p>In any case, the worst of the changes and the loophole they create are outlined in my comments there. </p>

<p>‘(b) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors from engaging in any medium or form of communication, either directly or indirectly, because a United States domestic audience is or may be thereby exposed to program material, or based on a presumption of such exposure. <strong>Such material may be made available within the United States and disseminated</strong>, when appropriate, <strong>pursuant to sections 502 and 1005 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948</strong> (22 U.S.C. 1462 and 1437), except that nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors to disseminate within the United States any program material prepared for dissemination abroad on or before the effective date of the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012.</p>

<p>So this means that they can allow people to privately view previous broadcasts, but that they still may not publicly broadcast those previous broadcasts to the American people. ( It wouldn&#39;t even make sense to do that, it makes more sense to say &quot;no you can&#39;t look at archival copies of our previous propaganda transmissions&quot; if you want to stay on top of the propaganda game. )</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 502.

</blockquote>

<p>This is literally stating that the Secretary will NOT engage in information activities, where there is already favorable information activities coming from private entities.</p>

<p>In other words, if CBS is already telling Pakistanis to hate Syrians, then they should save their money because CBS is already doing their work for them.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if there is already an American Broadcasting company operating in Germany, the Department of State or Broadcasting Board of Governors should utilize their already existing assets first, before going and spending ridiculous amounts of money to do the same thing.</p>

<p>So if &quot;Exemplar Films&quot; already has a studio in Berlin, then we should save the money if we can contract them to use their studio.</p>

<p>IN SUMMARY:</p>

<p>None of these updates have changed the Smith-Mundt Act so far as the ban on dissemination of domestic propaganda is concerned.</p>

<p>Everybody here saying &quot;the smithmundt act banning propaganda is no longer in effect&quot; is factually wrong, and completely ignorant of these laws.</p>

<p>I understand, however, because I know how to properly comprehend what I read.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like you people actually have no understanding of this Smith-Mundt act, which hasn&#39;t been repealed, only updated, and not updated to allow for &quot;loopholes&quot; that technically already existed.</p>

<p>The act states that they may not prepare propaganda intended for US citizens, and they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>They have amended the act so that US citizens can request and view archival copies of prior broadcasts for specific purposes of research and education.</p>
