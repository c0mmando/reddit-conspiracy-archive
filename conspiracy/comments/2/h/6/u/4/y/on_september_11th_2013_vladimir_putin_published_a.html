       "No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria. But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists. Reports that militants are preparing another attack — this time against Israel — cannot be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America’s long-term interest? I doubt it. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan “you’re either with us or against us.”
      </p>
      <p>
       But force has proved ineffective and pointless. Afghanistan is reeling, and no one can say what will happen after international forces withdraw. Libya is divided into tribes and clans. In Iraq the civil war continues, with dozens killed each day. In the United States, many draw an analogy between Iraq and Syria, and ask why their government would want to repeat recent mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how targeted the strikes or how sophisticated the weapons, civilian casualties are inevitable, including the elderly and children, whom the strikes are meant to protect."

       The fact that this letter is from Putin is really beside the point. What was written is still logical and should not be discarded simply because Putin. And just for the record; Russia has a lot of political, economic and military interests in Ukraine. I do not endorse his way of handling the Ukrainian crisis, but imagine if Egypt or Turkey was overthrown by an anti-NATO government? If I am not mistaken Egypt actually had a democratic election resulting in just this, but USA and Great Britain shut that down pretty fast.

       Enjoy the final perks of this society while you can. Then if something does happen, you need to accept it, and adapt to your new environment.

       Funny how after the outcry against Syria that we just happen to get a group that is horrible enough to make it okay to attack.

       Makes me wonder about the true origin and motivation of Isis, funny how they also got all that US equipment to help them be terrorist as well.

       So, the American President should bow down to what the Russian Premier wants? Er, bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is laughable since Putin is actually invading a free sovereign country right now! Or has everyone conveniently forgotten the Ukraine?
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk about a double standard, your hypocrisy is showing, I mean  why didn’t Putin listen when the entire fucking world asked him to NOT Invade the Ukraine?

       He should of just dronebombed northern Ukraine into submission right? That shit works out 10/10 every tieme.
Edit: Get your head out of your arse, no nation is lead by Jesus. Russia is as bad as the next one, and don't think for a second that either Usa or Russia gives a fuck as long as they get what they want.

       If Russia has interests in Ukraine, that it should negotiate and deal with Ukraine, and not engage in thuggery and bullshit to destroy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Ukraine is turned against Russia and is taking measures and closing doors to it, it is Russia itself who is doing everything for it.
