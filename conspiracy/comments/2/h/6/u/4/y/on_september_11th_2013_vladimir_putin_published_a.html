    <div class="md"><p>&quot;No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria. But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists. Reports that militants are preparing another attack — this time against Israel — cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States. Is it in America’s long-term interest? I doubt it. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan “you’re either with us or against us.”</p>

<p>But force has proved ineffective and pointless. Afghanistan is reeling, and no one can say what will happen after international forces withdraw. Libya is divided into tribes and clans. In Iraq the civil war continues, with dozens killed each day. In the United States, many draw an analogy between Iraq and Syria, and ask why their government would want to repeat recent mistakes.</p>

<p>No matter how targeted the strikes or how sophisticated the weapons, civilian casualties are inevitable, including the elderly and children, whom the strikes are meant to protect.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah Putin is such a humanitarian, ever heard of the Chechen Wars? Where a whole generation were radicalised and brutalised? Many now fighting in Afghanistan and Syria, thanks to Putin.</p>

<p>Ever heard of Georgia? The Ukraine? The Beslen Massacre? The Russian Theatre Crisis, where Putin killed 90% of the civilian hostages with gas to kill a few more Chechen Terrorists?</p>

<p>Russia has one of the worst human rights records in the world and you act like Putin is fucking Gandhi! Grow up this is sickening you take THIS propaganda at face value, simply because it isn’t American.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that this letter is from Putin is really beside the point. What was written is still logical and should not be discarded simply because Putin. And just for the record; Russia has a lot of political, economic and military interests in Ukraine. I do not endorse his way of handling the Ukrainian crisis, but imagine if Egypt or Turkey was overthrown by an anti-NATO government? If I am not mistaken Egypt actually had a democratic election resulting in just this, but USA and Great Britain shut that down pretty fast.</p>

<p>When negotiation breaks down, what follows? And I must clarify, I don&#39;t like Russia&#39;s way of dealing with this any more than you do. And I feel for the Ukrainian people. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They had their own puppet president in Ukraine, of course they will get mad when he is overthrown. </p>

<p>Ukraine has every right to act as they do. They are, after all, protecting their country from another nation. </p>

<p>The only thing distinguishing Ukraine - Russia from NATO - Middle-East is that NATO has a better reason than Russia (as far as we know).</p>

<p>Also Europe &gt; Middle-East.</p>
