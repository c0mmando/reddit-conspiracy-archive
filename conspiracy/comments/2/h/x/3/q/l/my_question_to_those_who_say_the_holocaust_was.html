<p>I&#39;m not sure they do. I&#39;m not too passionate about the subject either way but I guess it&#39;s just a matter of accuracy, especially when the Nazis are widely considered the worst people ever and the holocaust the worst thing ever. </p>

<p>The point is <strong>control</strong>. The Jewish/Zionist <em>Leaders</em> don&#39;t give a shit about the every day Jewish person (or any other people). The Jewish leaders just want control - of <em>everything</em>, for ever! The alleged &quot;Holocaust&quot; was a way to gain political points, en masse, without having to kill a lot of people. Judging by the response it seems to have worked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is why I feel so sorry for Jews. It&#39;s not a nice thing to feel like the whole world hates you. Imagine looking back through history to see so many killed supposedly due to the intangible but omnipresent evil force of <em>antisemitism</em>.</p>

<p>Scares them into intense nationalism, fanatical solidarity and all the while with a huge holocaust chip on the shoulder to assuage any moral guilt. It&#39;s hard to care about higher ideals when one is under constant threat. They constantly think there&#39;s a balance to be restored, but they never get there, and every decision made by their government sinks them lower in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>What a thing to be sold out so completely by the only people you feel you can trust in a world that hates you.</p>

<p>The whole world <em>doesn&#39;t</em> hate Jews. That is a myth. It is just the Jewish <em>Leaders</em> that are hated...not the common Jew. That said, the Leaders are quick to confuse the two and the gullible population falls for it. However, I have found that there are a lot of Jews that do indeed have a chip on their shoulders and use the &quot;everyone hates Jews&quot; bullshit to blackmail gains from everyone else. That has to stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were sent to concentration camps (it was not a loaded term in those days) to remove them from German society, along with other people the national socialists deemed undesirable, pending deportation to someplace more suitable for them after the Germans won the war. There was also the matter of the Jewish moneyed elite having declared war on Germany in 1932; and because of their wealth and influence, a substantial faction of Jewish people represented an internal threat to Germany during wartime. Abuse was never intended, but unfortunately came to pass as a result of the British instigated allied policy of total war; as did the horrendous suffering of the rest of Germany. Nobody is denying the suffering and dying of the concentration camp inmates; historical revisionists merely insist the truth about what happened be told, and that credit be placed where it is due.</p>

Bankster controlled fascism, which Nazi Germany had originally been intended to be the prototype of, won.</p>
