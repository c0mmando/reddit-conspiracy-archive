       I don't think anyone says he didn't mean them any harm. He tore them from their homes, took their belongings and forced them into camps.

      <p>
       I'm not sure where you get that idea from. Most 'holocaust deniers' I've seen would say the camps were labor camps, not places to store people while they were executed.

       I'd agree with that statement. Like the Japanese labor camps America was using during WWII only the supply lines were cut and they had to burn bodies due to typhus. At least, if information is to be believed. Granted, there is a lot I don't really know about the situation and a lot I will never know without having a first hand account of all perspectives.

       In the "Greatest Story Never Told" doc, it also says that Hitler actually helped the Jewish peoples migrate from Germany to Palestine and they were encouraged to take their belongings and transfer their money from Germany to Palestine.

       He simply wanted them the fuck out of his country. Just as we do now, because they are doing what they always do. Bleed the host dry.  There is no symbiotic relationship.  Their claimed "religion" is to avoid being called out for their massive crimes against us.

       I just don't understand why the 'holocaust deniers' think that's any better. To be forced to work without food, separated from families, and in environment with disease. Just because they think "less people died" then what we were taught, or working until death as opposed to getting gassed is any different. I just don't understand the point.

       I guess raping a nations economy with zionist central banking and manipulation of the mass media coupled with selling the German people down the river after what was considered the most hospitable country to the Jews.

       I'm not sure they do. I'm not too passionate about the subject either way but I guess it's just a matter of accuracy, especially when the Nazis are widely considered the worst people ever and the holocaust the worst thing ever.

       The point is

        control

       . The Jewish/Zionist
       <em>

       don't give a shit about the every day Jewish person (or any other people). The Jewish leaders just want control - of
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       , for ever! The alleged "Holocaust" was a way to gain political points, en masse, without having to kill a lot of people. Judging by the response it seems to have worked.

       That is why I feel so sorry for Jews. It's not a nice thing to feel like the whole world hates you. Imagine looking back through history to see so many killed supposedly due to the intangible but omnipresent evil force of
       <em>
        antisemitism
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Scares them into intense nationalism, fanatical solidarity and all the while with a huge holocaust chip on the shoulder to assuage any moral guilt. It's hard to care about higher ideals when one is under constant threat. They constantly think there's a balance to be restored, but they never get there, and every decision made by their government sinks them lower in the eyes of the world.
      </p>

       The whole world
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       hate Jews. That is a myth. It is just the Jewish
       <em>

       that are hated...not the common Jew. That said, the Leaders are quick to confuse the two and the gullible population falls for it. However, I have found that there are a lot of Jews that do indeed have a chip on their shoulders and use the "everyone hates Jews" bullshit to blackmail gains from everyone else. That has to stop.

       Yeah, that's what I'm saying... Jews, by their leadership, are made to feel victimized, that the forces of antisemitism are out to get them. I'd hate to live like that. Of course it breeds antipathy toward the rest of the world. Jews need to wake up!! (as we all do)

       Prison labor.  Plain and simple.  Auschwitz had a goddamn Olympic size swimming pool, and there is no VALID proof of zyclon B being used for anything other than delousing.   There have been no found bodies or claimed ash pits for the claimed number of people.  We saw emaciated prisoners as the ear machine and German infrastructure was breaking down.

       I believe the swimming pool was only half the Olympic size. Who suffers like the Jews, right?

       They were sent to concentration camps (it was not a loaded term in those days) to remove them from German society, along with other people the national socialists deemed undesirable, pending deportation to someplace more suitable for them after the Germans won the war. There was also the matter of the Jewish moneyed elite having declared war on Germany in 1932; and because of their wealth and influence, a substantial faction of Jewish people represented an internal threat to Germany during wartime. Abuse was never intended, but unfortunately came to pass as a result of the British instigated allied policy of total war; as did the horrendous suffering of the rest of Germany. Nobody is denying the suffering and dying of the concentration camp inmates; historical revisionists merely insist the truth about what happened be told, and that credit be placed where it is due.

       Fascism was the intended result of that for Germany; but throwing the bankster parasites off was not. The war was not fought between fascism and democracy, as the propaganda says; it was a fight between the plethora of fascist powers which emerged from the great depression (which it was initiated to create) over private central banking. Bankster controlled fascism, which Nazi Germany had originally been intended to be the prototype of, won.
