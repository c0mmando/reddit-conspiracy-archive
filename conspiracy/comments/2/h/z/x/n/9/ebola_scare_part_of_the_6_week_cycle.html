       I don't know if it is or not, but it seems to fit fairly well temporally. With Ferguson trailing off in the news, maybe this is the next concern with which to indoctrinate the american public.

       I feel like this six week cylce thing (though interesting) is similar to numerology, in that if you look hard enough, youre bound to find
       <em>

       that fits the preconceived result...

       Also consider that they have a +/- of 2 weeks last time I checked. That means it's statistically probable that any event ever will fall within it.

       Don't get hung up on the "6 weeks" portion of the idea. Pay attention to the reality that state actors can and will promote their agenda by means of propaganda and disinformation tactics. The hypothesis of the 6 week cycle is that it takes around 6 weeks (4-8 weeks) for the events which promote state agendas to be placed into the broadcast news cycle.

       You seem to buy into ironic responses. If this is a propaganda event, then the concern being promoted throughout r/conspiracy is itself fear-mongering.
       <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text/enr#link=A_X_H_1078_a&amp;amp;nearest=H3C8D18E917DD40CAABFB0544EEBC6DBD">
        Here's the Smith-Mundt Act Amendment
       </a>
       I referenced above. You can search any of the referenced acts in that section with "Misuse" in google and come up with hundreds of documents detailing that the interpretations of what is legitimately disseminated information are often times contrary to the well-being of the citizenry.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't conspiracy theory nuttiness. This is a piece of legislation that has been in effect for almost a year and a half. There is an allocated budget for the overall activity and broadcast channels by which the propaganda pieces are disseminated.

       Yeah this was my concern when I first saw it. They fit some seemingly non-events into the pattern and then a big event falls outside of it. It doesn't seem to really be anything.

       Sure, and it'd be exactly like numerology except that the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 was passed in the National Defense Authorization Act 2013 authorizing government and military agencies in the following manner:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The bill's purpose is "to authorize the domestic dissemination of information and material about the United States intended primarily for foreign audiences"[35] The act was added to the 2013 NDAA bill as section of 1078 to amend certain passages of Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987.[36] The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 passed Congress as part of the NDAA 2013 on December 28, 2012.[36]
        <strong>
         Amendments made to the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987 allow for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be released within US borders.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So its jut like numerology provided numerology had an entity with a multi-billion dollar budget making its predictions appear true.

       What predictions do the 6-week cycle make? I may be ignorant, but as far as i know the whole theory is based on
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       happens as a false flag every six weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im just saying that it is easy enough to look back and find
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       that occured (e.g. a bombing, shooting, failed attempts, etc.) to fit this cycle. That doesnt necessarily prove anything unless there is proof that each of the events stated were indeed false flags, and that each event is proven to be connected.

       The 6 week cycle hypothesis predicts that around every 6 weeks a new round of propaganda is disseminated through broadcast media. Aug 9th 2014 saw the promotion of the Ferguson shooting, just about 6 weeks later, here we are with an ebola scare.

       Sure, except for the vast state actor that has declared it legal to use any and all means of broadcast communication to lie to you. Why does the Smith Mundt Modernization Act have no consideration in your rebuttal?

       Its not just "potential". Its a budget to lie, the means to lie, the incentive to lie, and the demonstrated fact that government agencies have been promoting propaganda (lies) through mainstream and internet sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't say I've proved its a lie. I said, hey, given all that we've seen in the past few years, doesn't it seem like this event (ebola outbreak) fits in with all the rest of the propaganda we've been exposed to?

       It means that government agencies can disseminate information created with techniques used on foreign populations (psy-ops (and standard diplomacy to be fair)) to US citizens. The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act effectively amended the Smith-Mundt Act which authorized the US Government to use propaganda techniques on foreign populations. The amended version allows the gov to use propaganda techniques on the US population. The amended act stipulates:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall be used to influence public opinion in the United States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which is then immediately invalidated with the contents of the next line of the bill:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This section shall apply only to programs carried out pursuant to the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.), the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act (22 U.S.C. 1465 et seq.), and the Television Broadcasting to Cuba Act (22 U.S.C. 1465aa et seq.).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Google searches for "misuse" and the referenced acts lead the dedicated researcher to many instances of alleged fraud and abuse, suggesting further that the  interpretation of the acts themselves remain somewhat undecided as to what constitutes a breach of the intended legislation.

       It doesn't have to be scary. It can be used positively. How it can be used positively is a bit more difficult to suss out. But being aware of the technique is vital.

       Right, and we agree that the fear is used for control. But how can we move the conversation forward from there? If this cycle, or another propaganda cycle like that hypothesized exists, can it be used by anyone aware of it? If so, who would be using it already? Is there a defense against it? How far does the apparatus extend? For instance, can you trust local news sources over national? Or are local sources even easier to exploit due to their size?

       Yes. It's a cheap, easy defense. It's called not buying into the bullshit in the first place. Not saying you do, it's more of a general statement.

       Not buying in isn't a defense when the majority of people around you do buy in. Not buying in didn't prevent the invasions of Iraq, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya... So that was no defense. Even more insidious is the underlying statement - there is no way to actively resist deceit, the best you can do is see through it.

       True, this resistance/enlightenment didn't stop American invasion, but even if the populace were dead-set against aggression, all it would've taken was the media to sell them a handful of shitty reasons to support said aggression, something they did, and continue to do.

       As to what we can do, look around and consider the options. We agree that most around us are drunk on Kool Aid. We also have seen that those who step out of line are stamped with 'truther', or 'conspiracy theorist' labels and shunned. So what
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       we do? This is a great question, and one that has no clear answer apart from stay away from mainstream sources and draw your own conclusions as to what is happening. A mite anticlimactic of an answer maybe but if more like us got together maybe a solid solution could be reached?

      <p>
       Step 1 was see through it. We have, how do we take the conversation to step 2, what to do once you've seen through it? What do you think step 2 entails? I don't think its fight the power. I think its more along the lines of identify and control the power. I think some of the modelling I do in that post opens the possibility of identifying and controlling the power structures around us.

       What makes you think its as legit as it gets? What independent sources that you are receiving your information from verify the outbreak? Is that information predicated on "official" sources? And if so, how trustworthy are those official sources given the Smith-Mundt Modernization act signed into law July 2013?

       I've presented my evidence to you about why I think this event is a propaganda event. The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act makes the dissemination of propaganda to US citizens legal.

       Its ironic you didn't read the post I responded to wherein he claims its a legitimate event. I asked what makes him think that? I'm curious. It may be a legitimate event, those happen too. But without independently verified sources, how would we know this is a legitimate event as opposed to a propaganda piece?

        something
       </em>
       is bound to happen given the time parameters, that will inevitably fit such a broad and general prediction that
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       will happen, or that *some propaganda" will be released.

       Do you not understand the logical fallacy this claim is using to support its argument?

       I understand the "logical fallacy" you are trying to interpret this conversation through. It is not the case that we are discussing the texas sharpshooter fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The creation and implementation of a deception system is through an intelligent actor making conscious decisions. We know that an intelligent actor (the state) has created a deception system (propaganda as demonstrated by the SMMA). The question is, does this event fit in to that deception system?

       Just to be clear, that was pertaining to the six week cycle. However, this last comment of yours sparked a renewed interest for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I propose we start from the beginning. We can ignore the "ebola/six-week-cycle" connection
       <em>
        for now
       </em>
       , so that we can discuss this act better, then move on to see how it relates to your OP. Sound fair?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill start by expressing my understanding of the last part of your OP, so that its easier for you to lay it out in order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, you are implying that this current case of ebola in dallas is or will be used to further a certain propaganda. Is that right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And as evidence to support your claim (that they use propaganda spiels relative to the six week cycle theory, and this is the next "installment"), you cite the SMMA. Lemme know if ive misunderstood something thus far, as the context is important for me to understand where youre coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       If my understandings above are correct, id like for you to start at the beginning of how the SMMA fits into all of this, if you dont mind. (We'll get into how it relates to the six week cycle soon, i just want to make sure we are on the same page first...)

       You have misunderstood. The SMMA leads to the "6 week cycle". The 6 week cycle is a consequence of institutional deceit. It could be a 6 week cycle, a four hour cycle, a fifteen minute cycle depending on what needs to be transmitted and the time frame within which it needs to be transmitted. That a propaganda system is in place and actively used is documented and obvious. Whether reporting on an ebola outbreak is a part of that system is the question posed by my OP.

       The conspiracy sites are just as often sourcing their claims on "official" sources, which the Smith-Mundt Modernization act (SMMA) make impossible to verify. What independent sources verify the claim of an ebola outbreak? I'm not saying there aren't such sources, I'm asking what they are so that I too can accept the ebola outbreak as a legitimate concern rather than a propaganda piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claimed this is a legitimate event, which I take to mean an event that is being portrayed as it actually is. I am asking you, given that the SMMA makes it impossible to determine the veracity of an event by means of official sources, what independent sources do you have access to that indicate that the current buzz about ebola is a true event and not an agenda driven propaganda event?

       That's a good observation and absolutely true. What means do we have to independently verify an event? I don't know, its a hard question. It would be useless to set up a propaganda system that always lied, nobody would believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you know some amount of media is going to be a propaganda piece, and you know that the entities involved with creating the propaganda are sophisticated in how they will craft the propaganda, how do you as a consumer of media determine which is real media and which is false media?

       True, but so is trusting a polling of falsely independent sources. Its a rough time, contrary to all the pollyanna "nah this is legit, I can tell" comments. I think people are blind to exactly how capable propaganda systems are of shaping public opinion, and the breadth of the tactics used by such propaganda systems.

       Those (SMMA and the 6 week hypothesis (as illustration of the effects of SMMA)) are my sources. I do not have any others. I predicate my entire argument on the SMMA and its application to broadcast and internet media.

       Well crafted propaganda will follow a logical series of events if it is able. It needs plausibility, especially in an environment wherein information is easy to attain.

       Which evidence? Please remember, in the context of this discussion, evidence needs to be sourced from an independent source. You haven't given me your evidence yet, so to declare as fact that the evidence outweighs any other interpretation is just grandstanding.

       If it is a cycle in nature we can understand and approach it in the manner we've approached all nature at this point, via investigation and testing analysis. How do you test the analysis that the nature of neurology leads to a natural pattern? Once tested, can this phenomenon be used intentionally?

       Or it could be nothing but imagery and simulation. Or it could be a legitimate outbreak of ebola. The factual veracity of an ebola scare is what I am discussing in this thread. Motives, agendas and results are immaterial. Let an investigator figure that out, and having an idea before conducting investigation is a guaranteed way to go down the wrong track.

       What predictions do the 6-week cycle make? I may be ignorant, but as far as i know the whole theory is based on
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       happens as a false flag every six weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im just saying that it is easy enough to look back and find
       <em>
        something

       that occured (e.g. a bombing, shooting, failed attempts, etc.) to fit this cycle. That doesnt necessarily prove anything unless there is proof that each of the events stated were indeed false flags, and that each event is proven to be connected.

       It means that government agencies can disseminate information created with techniques used on foreign populations (psy-ops (and standard diplomacy to be fair)) to US citizens. The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act effectively amended the Smith-Mundt Act which authorized the US Government to use propaganda techniques on foreign populations. The amended version allows the gov to use propaganda techniques on the US population. The amended act stipulates:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall be used to influence public opinion in the United States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which is then immediately invalidated with the contents of the next line of the bill:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This section shall apply only to programs carried out pursuant to the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.), the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act (22 U.S.C. 1465 et seq.), and the Television Broadcasting to Cuba Act (22 U.S.C. 1465aa et seq.).
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Google searches for "misuse" and the referenced acts lead the dedicated researcher to many instances of alleged fraud and abuse, suggesting further that the  interpretation of the acts themselves remain somewhat undecided as to what constitutes a breach of the intended legislation.

       If it is a cycle in nature we can understand and approach it in the manner we've approached all nature at this point, via investigation and testing analysis. How do you test the analysis that the nature of neurology leads to a natural pattern? Once tested, can this phenomenon be used intentionally?
