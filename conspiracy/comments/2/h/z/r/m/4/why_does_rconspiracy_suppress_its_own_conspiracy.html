<p>Won&#39;t make me stop reading Zero Hedge or Russia Today or any other news source I choose to add to the canon, though. But it&#39;s worth educating people about. Like Vice or David Duke or Natural News or Washington Post or Wall Street Journal or USA Today or NBC News links. It is helpful to let people know more about their sources&#39; angles to help decouple agendas from data.</p>

<p>You&#39;re never going to find the truth, though, if you close your eyes to available information that doesn&#39;t suit your agenda.</p>

<p>What gives you that impression? I&#39;ve been around this sub for a while now and haven&#39;t noticed any special attention given to zerohedge. (in fact I haven&#39;t noticed any special attention to any sites on this sub which is refreshing. I guess infowards and RT get called out on occasion, but that&#39;s it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I see,</p>

<p>My opinion on the issue is that this community is so used to people showing up here to complain about sources and start campaigns to try and get certain sources blocked that they tend to down vote anyone who &quot;goes there&quot;.</p>

<p>This sub is one of the few places that refuses to restrict domains, most of us prefer to read multiple sources on the same topic and make our own independent conclusions.  When people get bossy about what source is valid and what source is authoritative, they tend to get buried by down votes.</p>

<p>This all started with the Hitler doc. I&#39;m having trouble determining where its narrative comes from. The production company is mysterious, but the narrative is definitely east-european or russian.   </p>

<p>That is it. Its too much for people too. We have &quot;official western media&quot; we are trained to refute, so any view of opposition must be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I justed wasted 7 seconds of my life because i gave you the benefit of the doubt. This is why i dont watch youtube videos from reddit. </p>

<p>And you dont understand why folks are confused with you? Your presentation, whatever it is attempting to portray, is terrible and scatter brained. There is no coherence to your train of thought as you present it. </p>

<p>Im done trying to figure this out. I wish you luck.</p>
