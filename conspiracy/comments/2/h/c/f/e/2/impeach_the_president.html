       So /Conspiracy do you think Obama has given the American people enough evidence to impeach him. Taking into account his actions in syria and the war with Isis ? If there is anything else you he has done that would add to his crimes please post it.

       Impeaching might not even get rid of him. Impeachment is nothing but a political stunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to be rid of him, you need to convict him of a felony. If you somehow manage to do that, you get Biden. (And if GWB and Cheney weren't convicted of felonies they actually DID commit, GL getting Obama convicted.)

       As to the rest of what you wrote... say "Hi" to the men in suits when they arrive. As long as you remain calm and answer their questions honestly, they'll probably only stay a few hours and then leave. If you get all douche-nozzle on them, you'll have a very, very bad time.

       You're asking my opinion. You got it. The US
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       participate in the ICC. By not doing so it makes itself a rogue state. And passing a law that says "neener neener your laws can't touch me!" makes zero difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass murder = 3000+ Americans killed on 9/11 and many, many illegal wars waged under false pretenses.

       To prove that particular mass murder on 9/11, you would need to prove GWB &amp; Cheney orchestrated it. If you can prove that, you will quickly become famous, rich, then probably dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't really asking your
       <em>
        opinion
       </em>
       , but rather your rationale behind calling for the prosecution of a sitting President, which usually means reasonable suspicion and proof of the committal of a felony.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have seems to be a dislike of a great many things but neither
       <strong>
        reasonable
       </strong>
       suspicion nor
       <strong>
        evidence
       </strong>
       . So it's just meaningless chatter. Rhetoric. Politicians do that a lot.

       They are top suspects. They should be in custody, there should be a full investigation and a trial. I'm not the judge, nor jury, nor executioner.

       Yep, I'm a shill. Because I ask questions and point out flaws in logic. Intellectual challenges can't be legit. They must be liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "top suspect" in any crime is not taken into custody until sufficient evidence against them exists. The strength of the evidence required increases with the severity of the crime and notoriety of the suspect.
      </p>

       Oops, more rationality injected into your fantasy? Just invoke your cognitive dissonance and ignore it as "shill".

       That's how it works silly. Suspects of serious crimes are held in jail awaiting trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the govt says it can execute anybody accused of being a terrorist without a trial, so...

       Yeah that's why I know someone who has been waiting trial for over a year and has been locked up this whole time. That's not okay, people should not be locked up like that without any sort of a trial.

       That's messed up. That whole right to a speedy trial thing has gone out the window with the Patriot Act.

       I like the idea of charging our politicians/executives/shills who conspire to kill Americans under their own anti-terrorism laws and locking them up in the FEMA camps they meant for us. I go back and forth as to whether those 30,000 guillotines should be pressed into service, but it's not my decision to make.

       What about gaza? Were they enemy combatants?

      <p>
       Very true though, he gave orders to fire on the enemy.. that he (or they.. whatever) created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isis is a fucking joke, I believe they are real but manipulated. Maybe the CIA didn't directly create them but instead indirectly funded them through the rebels to help them grow and BECOME a threat that they once never were. These beheading videos are the biggest, lamest excuse for war like, ever.

       Maybe I've missed something in the news. Did US forces kill anyone in Gaza recently? Is there a link to a (reputable) news source? (Reputable does not mean CNN, but it does mean reputable...)

       How would bombing ISIS be an impeachable offense? The UN hasn't condemned it, and even Assad supports it. Nobody wants ISIS controlling anything. Ten other Arab nations are participating in fighting ISIS, as are many countries in Europe, and Australia and Canada. Who can possibly be against bombing ISIS?

       I'm not saying I'm against it, what I'm getting at is that Obama does whatever he wants when he wants. In order to be at war the United States needs congressional approval. As of now with Isis the US doesn't have it. And that's against the law and the Constitution. So I could just as easily say "the Constitution is good and you're against it? How could anyone want to be against or undermine the Constitution.&gt;How would bombing ISIS be an impeachable offense? The UN hasn't condemned it, and even Assad supports it.
