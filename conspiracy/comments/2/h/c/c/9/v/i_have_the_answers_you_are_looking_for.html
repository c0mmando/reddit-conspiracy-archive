    <div class="md"><p>How about this:</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to tell a story that I believe is lost from the global narrative. At one time in history, there was an empire so vast and powerful they dominated three continents. They made slaves of everyone. They brought all the slaves together and engaged in campaign of breeding for traits so extensive that the effects are obvious and documentable to this very day.</p>

<p>Eventually this empire declined and disintegrated, but the slaves remained. Largely divided into several castes, including the group that had been bred for war, and the group that had been bred to be the scribes and run the empire. And with the crumbling of the empire the scribes retained the capability for writing and they held on to this control dearly. The kept this knowledge so secret that the rest of the world descended into a deep dark age. The scribe caste despised the other slaves so much that they disavowed their singular heritage and common origin as a product of this slave empire. And through their total control over the means of writing and mass communication they manipulated history and enforced a segregation. Eventually, many many years later, after all the other slave castes had successfully integrated and adopted a singular culture the scribe cast refused to adopt their brethren. They maintained a total control over this slave nations politics and economy, until finally the lower classes rose up and toppled the scribe usurpers. Yet somehow, to this very day, the lower classes that revolted get the credit for the hatred and segregation and bloody revenge that being controlled by the scribe class had caused.</p>

<p>So, would you like to know what it feels like to be on the losing side of a propaganda war?</p>

<p>You think I don&#39;t know what this is all about? That it&#39;s too late to even... prepare? I don&#39;t need your answers, you&#39;re not a prophet.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right though, family ties. Not exactly an award winner here, but I know that those ties are one of the few things I need to be worried about. Not your &quot;answers&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well actually, I was sleeping... lol.</p>

<p>I accept your hand of help.</p>

<p>But I want to know who you are/what you represent. I guess I&#39;m not asking for a direct answer here but give me what you can?</p>

<p>What is the purpose of you being here?</p>

<p>Your family ties? What, are you Rothschild?</p>

<p>What&#39;s this you speak of a woman in red?
Why would I want to seek a &quot;Woman&quot; in red?</p>

<p>Your account is only two days old, and your time spent here is pretty interesting. You could easily be a bot, or even the woman in red. </p>

<p>You gotta give me SOMEthing that tells me you are who you say you are. Something that tells me you really ARE a helping hand, which is indeed what I am seeking.</p>
