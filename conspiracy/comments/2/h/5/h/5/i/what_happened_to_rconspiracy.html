       I've been a long time lurker and come here quite often. There has always been great quality info here. The articles and videos can, most the time, be backed up by fact and sources. The discussions are usually compelling and with strong arguments for both sides that keep you thinking open-mindedly.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I see now are sensationalized headlines, discussions turning into instant circlejerks, tons of pictures boasting statistics with nothing to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Thanks everybody for your input. I got a lot more answers than I thought I would. The main one seems to be "stop being a lurker and contribute instead of complaining about nothing good being posted."

       Waves of trolls do occasionally pop up.  Then there's people who may have good intentions but just aren't that smart or don't understand what this sub is for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's better to have too little moderation than too much, lest the mods be accused of censoring.  Reward the good posts with upvotes and comments, downvote and ignore the bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also must note.  One of these "What's happening to conspiracy" posts shows up at least once a week.  They don't really help anything and take slots away from actual content.  They can be disheartening to users who take this seriously.  I noticed that the OP of this one hasn't really contributed to this sub as far as I can tell, and admits to being a lurker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lurking is fine, but contributing is better.  Complaining without contributing looks like
       <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concern_troll">
        concern trolling
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (Internet slang) Someone who posts to an internet forum or newsgroup, claiming to share its goals while deliberately working against those goals, typically, by claiming "concern" about group plans to engage in productive activity, urging members instead to attempt some activity that would damage the group's credibility, or alternatively to give up on group projects entirely.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not calling out OP to pick a fight, but remember this is a community.  If things aren't up to your standards a little effort to make positive contributions can go a long way.  Some of us put a lot of time and effort into this and take our work very seriously.

       I see what you mean. I hadn't thought of those variables. What do you mean by it being disheartening to other users?

       And you are right to be sceptical when I haven't contributed anything other than my votes and a complaint. I'll just have to stop complaining and contribute to the community I have loved from afar.

       Pretty much. It's like if you don't have decent news or a topic with some credability then you should probably avoid posting just to create content because then the quality of the content goes down. I'm all for an active subreddit but not at the expense of the topic that subreddit covers.

       Just like in real life, voting is near meaningless.  For if it were, it would be illegal.  This is not a reason to stop.  Just a reason to point out the inherent Zionist shills who have corruption of our own home sub.  The next incarnation of social media must correct this.  Its too late for the already corrupted reddit.

       I've been lurking the past day or so to check it out, since it's where the majority is bailing on 4chan to go. It's the same style, but users can make their own boards (and appoint mods). Also, the admin seems cool.

       True, but if this subreddit is as inundated with trolls and shills as people suggest then good posts are going to get downvoted and bad posts are going to be upvoted quite quickly. One of the reasons I frequent the "new" area so often. I figure it's the only chance I have for the most part of catching good shit before it's downvoted to hell. I don't know how true any of this is, but it's the best method for avoiding what I suspect may be an issue.

       It's the same anywhere you go. There are people spreading misinformation on purpose or just to mess with people. You just need to be cautious with what you believe. Read everything: that's the only way you'll find the truth.

       The exact same thing happens in r/hailcorporate - Occasionally there will be a noticeable influx of comments and votes that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Purport to be members of the community before making ridiculous claims and accusations that delegitimize the community overall
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Claim that the community has "lost its way" and plead for its members to be less confrontational
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Insults, appeals to ridicule, etc etc.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These efforts are usually accompanied by mass voting - often beyond the scope of what the subreddit usually sees in terms of votes per submission.

       Live and learn bro. Upvote solid content, down vote/ignore/call out shitposts. There's solid info here daily and gold here weekly/monthly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The challenge of lurking here is the ability to sift through the shit and go fact check solid posts and contribute to discussion when you can.

       And if you feel adventurous, 'leak' put into other subs armed with links and facts and REPRESENT when so inclined.

       Yeah. Maybe criticize later, when you're better informed? Communities about...
       <em>
        delicate
       </em>
       topics such as this one are bound to be a bit tempestuous and plagued with trolls, and certainly not everyone here agrees on everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So complaining about the quality of submissions declining is pretty damn unhelpful, because it's not like everyone on this sub got together and voted that the sub should be flooded with shitposts.

      <p>
       Calling the sub itself into question over it is
       <em>
        extremely

       counterproductive. Arguably trollish.

       I completely disagree with you on discouraging people from making this kind of posting. Why should anyone be discouraged from asking questions? It's posts like these that help maintain the integrity of this sub. I mean isn't that what this sub is all about, questioning everything? And what do you mean it's taking up a slot from "actual content"? How does this hurt anything at all? If we all accepted what we're given, then we wouldn't even have a sub like this to complain about.

       I'm not discouraging anyone from asking questions.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is
       <strong>
        all about
       </strong>
       asking questions that usually aren't asked.  But if all one is asking is "why isn't this sub the way I want it to be?" then they're really just complaining.  And by the way,  the answer is because you haven't done anything to contribute.
      </p>
      <p>
       The integrity of this sub is maintained by high quality posts.  There are people that work hard on trying to maintain a standard of quality.  If your question is "why are there some bad posts", the answer is a tolerant moderation policy, which I will defend.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no "king or r/conspiracy" that owes anyone any kind of explanation for why posts aren't to their liking.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a community.  It doesn't exist without it's members and posters.  Honestly, I think we're doing great.  To all of those that know what we're about and have that genuine thirst for truth, you know who you are.  Keep going and never give up.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I think I've made my point in my first.  There's just no pleasing some people.

       I'm not sure you've answered my question. How does this post hurt the sub, anyone or for that matter, anything at all. If you don't want to read this post, then don't, that's what the 1st Amendment is all about. Better yet, just tell us why you think the OP is wrong about it. But when we start to say this kind of speech is acceptable and this kind isn't, then we're on a slippery slope to censorship.

       I think part of it is intentional to destroy any conversation about certain topics.  It's hard for a passer-by to dig for the golden nuggets when the entire subreddit is spammed with noise.

       I'm not saying there isn't a single good post. There are always good posts but there seems to be a lot more of having to sift through the bad ones. You are right, though. My title does seem as sensationalized as the stuff I'm talking about. I am just noticing that there have been more posts about nonsense than usual. Thanks for pointing that out.

       Criticism is always welcome. That's why I asked the question. I was sure I'd get a few angry people but most everyone here has been helpful and knowledgeable about what they are talking about. I just feel like I shouldn't have to sift too much in a place like this. But as others have pointed out, the sub has become larger and there will be more submitted and more to sift through. It, unfortunately, makes a ton of sense.

       Interest waxes and wanes pretty much according to what's going in American schools; as, like it or not, students with time to burn are now the backbone of legit reddit (glory days were when that was tech employees getting paid mostly to be available). It's easy to think it's gone all to hell when school lets out, or in; as suddenly there is little else but shills and trolls for a period of time.

       Things became black and white.

       Now it's an us against them mentality. If you're not jumping onboard with something the burden of proof is on you, not the OP. If you don't agree you must be a shill. It's some sort neo-mcarthyism mentality. I just feel like there's no middle ground anymore. We've developed this culture of fear in our country that spreads like an infection. It's ok to question everything , here, the MSM, what the guy at work said etc. It's ok to be wrong or disagree. Just because you don't believe in UFO's doesn't mean that you can't believe that the CIA is running drugs or vice versa. I don't believe that there's a reptillian agenda, that everything in the MSM is a false flag and I also believe that the MSM pushes a govt written agenda on a lot of issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me just use fracking as an example, I've worked in oil and run wells right after they come online. I've been on a lot of active fracking sites. Those people setting their water on fire, could probably have set it on fire pre frack. Is there nasty shit going down the well, yep there's a lot of acid and other descaling agents. But it's mainly water, sand, guar gum(emulsifier also used in the food you eat) , clay and potassium. A lot of potassium. But I've never seen an anti fracking group post results showing the acids,guar gum or increased potassium in these water wells. I'm not saying there's not data out there showing it, I just haven't run across it. Is big oil bad, fuck yes but not for all the reasons they're pushing. It's bad because if we keep ramping up production oil prices will go down, it's bad because they're finding wells that "recharge" sort of validating the abiotic oil theory(if it's not scarce you won't pay a high price for it...just like diamonds), it's bad because we could be self sufficient but our corporations choose to sell crude on the foreign markets because it's more profitable. But if I try to call someone out on flaming tap water I'm a shill for the oil companies.

       A diamonds true value lies in its hardness. The monetary value of diamonds is a sham. One simply has to look at

       As for oil, its value lays in its necessity in the modern world. Its monetary value is based on the US-$Dollar. Look up the petrol-dollar, and its status as the world's currency reserve.

       There are an enormous amount of subscribers.  The culture tends to change dramatically as those numbers increase.  The hive mentality kicks into high gear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if one exists, but you might want to look for another sub-reddit or even message board that discusses conspiracy with far fewer subscribers.

       250K readers, 95% of them either lapsed IDs or shill sockpuppets.

      <p>
       laughably readership is up 10K since last month or so, despite the number of people voting up articles and doing constructive posts being the lowest for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       so 10K new shills/sockpuppets added to r/conspiracy in one month, says it all really.

       What? Do you have even the slightest proof or reason to think this? This is a pretty insane jump in logic.

       250K readers and the number of upvotes per thread is at its lowest numbers for six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       the sheer amount of non activity proves this.
      </p>
      <p>
       real visitors and readers of r/conspiracy would upvote threads they approve of or have an interest in, or just like.
      </p>
      <p>
       govt and corporate PR trolls and shills are not going to upvote threads they dislike, hence the low upvotes for threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you filter by top instead of hot or any other filter, the top thread has 1900 votes, thats prob a realistic percentage of the real people here, maybe 50% of the number visiting over the previous four days.
      </p>
      <p>
       so 5% or 10% of the 250K might be a good ballpark guesstimate as to the numbers of real people.

       to assume there are NOT people with a paid agenda downvoting threads that touch on sensitive topics.

      <p>
       its possible to conversant with shills occasionally on quiet times, if you are tactful and don't outright swear and cuss them for their trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently postulated to one obvious shill about the status and ethics of being one, the concept of selling lies for money, how could one sleep well at night doing such a job.

       and PS, its not up to us to prove a plane hit the Pentagon, we never said or claimed one did, your masters tried to sell us the story a plane went boom into the audit office there (the day after Rumsfeld announced the $2.3T accounting hole of ten years), its up to your masters to prove a submarine plane flew partially through the ground to make ONLY an initial 15' hole in the ground floor. nice pristine lawn you have there !?
