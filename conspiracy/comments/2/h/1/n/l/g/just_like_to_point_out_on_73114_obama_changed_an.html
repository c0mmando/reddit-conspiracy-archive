       I have been meaning to make a self post about this for my once records and see some discussion about it.  Obama changed
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/sars/quarantine/exec-2004-04-03.html">
        an executive order issued by Bush in 2003
       </a>
       to deal with the SARS outbreak which was a hot button topic when he wrote the executive order.  On 7/31/14 Obama
       <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/31/executive-order-revised-list-quarantinable-communicable-diseases">
        changed an 11year old executive order
       </a>
       a month before
       <a href="http://fox4kc.com/2014/08/28/unusual-respiratory-virus-enterovirus-68-strikes-metro-kids/">
        an enterovirus 68 outbreak

       .  You can also check out

       as well. When I first saw it,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2ccmnb/executive_order_revised_list_of_quarantinable/">
        I was suspicious and thought it had more to do with Ebola
       </a>
       than an actual respiratory illness outbreak, but I think they knew this outbreak was coming.  The outbreak started in Missouri, but now is
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/severe-respiratory-illness-spreads-to-northeast/">
        from Coast to Coast
       </a>
       .  Also, please note, Obama's revision specifically made sure influenza wasn't to be included.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I ran into several articles from February when there was a small outbreak of enterovirus 68 in California, affecting 25 kids.  Besides that, there hasn't been any other news besides that.  Here are some links from the February out break.

      <p>
       Edit 2:  Last point I forgot to mention, why would Obama change an executive order for a random respiratory illness on a whim (excluding Influenza), but not change the order when the Swine Flu (aka Influenza) outbreak of 2009?  Just say, it seems like the hype that surrounded the Swine Flu outbreak seemed like enough to change Bushes order to include H1N1, but didn't.  It's a strange move.

       You're right, I should have pointed that out, Obama's change generalizes the term SARS to include various respiratory diseases.  Check out Bushes order and the revisions Obama has made.

        (b) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which is
        <strong>
         a disease
        </strong>
        associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness, is transmitted from person to person predominantly by the aerosolized or droplet route, and, if spread in the population,
        <strong>
         would have severe public health consequences
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Obama's
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "(b) Severe acute respiratory syndromes, which
        <strong>
         are diseases
        </strong>
        that are associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness, are capable of being transmitted from person to person,
        <strong>
         and that either are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic, or, upon infection, are highly likely to cause mortality or serious morbidity if not properly controlled

       Well, the most important part about what he changed isn't the specifics that he updated. It's the fact that he dropped the route of transmission specification. The new definition fits any disease that is transmitted in any way that causes fever and may or may not be deadly depending on the circumstances. Other than that, they're pretty much the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, it looks like it's being made to fit Ebola.

       yeah i was about to say this... ebola has been around for a long time, and we've quarantined against it before.
      </p>
      <p>
       i find it interesting that he updated this executive order, but i don't see it as suspicious at all. SARS as a single disease is a silly idea, as most people would probably understand. there are no single names for viruses and the diseases they cause. SARS refers to the disease itself, but it can be caused by thousands of different strains and even different species. the thing is that some species cause similar symptoms, but not the
       <em>
        same
       </em>
       symptoms, and thus the diseases they cause can't technically be called SARS. this change, in my opinion, reflects the growing scientific consensus that there are no boundaries between viruses and illnesses, and that there is enormous diversity in the genes of viruses even within a single infection. i think the wording sounds prudent and scientifically informed, which i would expect in 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think obama is a suspicious character altogether, he's certainly done a lot of terrible things and failed to deliver on his campaign promises, but i don't see how this executive order is suspicious or malicious. it just seems like standard bureaucratic word mincing to me. also even if he did specifically change the wording to address ebola, how would that be a bad thing? the actual "outbreak" didn't start all at once, there have been cases leading up to this for years. i'm certain that his medical/scientific staff knew about this, because the whole global medical community has been talking about it more and more over the last year. it may not have been publicized by the media, but if he wrote an executive order to address it even two years ago i wouldn't be surprised or suspicious. he could have been trying to prevent exactly what has happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       even if he knew about ebola five years ago, before he was "supposed to," this executive order seems to be attempting to fight ebola, not spread it. it doesn't seem like a "population control" conspiracy regardless of how you look at it. if he was trying to create an outbreak, and knew about ebola's growing presence well in advance (which would imply that somebody he knew was planning to spread it intentionally) then why would he make an executive order to quarantine it? the only answer i can think of is that he wanted to protect america, but throw africa under the bus. i find this idea really silly, because the whole reason population control is an issue for the elite (ted turner for example) is because of the resources the people consume. people in africa consume less than 1% per capita than we in america consume. if you're trying to prevent the earth from reaching its resource-based human carrying capacity, you would want to start with america, where resources are consumed on an
       <em>
        extreme
       </em>
       level per capita. wiping out half the american population would certainly slow down global warming... wiping out the entire african population would do virtually nothing. i can't see how wiping out africa could offer any advantage to the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       moreover, we've seen some evidence that HIV was engineered by scientists, and damning evidence that it was either intentionally or accidentally spread through vaccines and medicines. but HIV already existed in africa when this conspiracy happened... it was distributed in hepatitis shots here in the united states, specifically against the gay and black populations. if they did this intentionally, then they must have had significant power. they must have been trying to curtail the populations of groups they found expendable, if it was intentional. if we believe that, then we have to assume that the elite's population control agenda is primarily aimed at the united states, who are the #1 resource consumers after all. if they engineered and spread HIV to curtail the american population, then why would they quarantine africa to prevent
       <em>
        ebola
       </em>
       from curtailing the american population? it serves the exact purpose they seem to have attempted with HIV (assuming the hepatitis conspiracy was intentional) yet they seem to have avoided it entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is all very complex and multi-faceted, and i can't claim that i even know what actually happened. i especially can't claim that i can get inside the heads of the potential conspirators. but i think it's a huge leap to look at this executive order and suspect that obama is up to something with ebola. he's certainly up to a lot of
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       things, but i see no evidence of something suspicious here. also i'm hesitant to use "obama" as the subject of these conspiracy theories, because i see presidents as nothing but puppets for the real power brokers. those who aren't puppets get killed. the idea that obama is the real leader of all this is ridiculous. how do i know that? well, he doesn't have any
       <em>
        money
       </em>
       . why would the numerous multibillionaires on the planet let a man with less than a million dollars' salary run the world? i can't say i hate obama, i think he sincerely wants to help people, but he's being completely controlled... why else would his hair have turned so gray? the man looked like he was in duress numerous times during speeches... looked like he was gonna cry, like there was something he wanted to say, but couldn't. could be my imagination... i'll try and find some examples and post them later.

       I made a self.post about this not too long ago. But, my suspicions included the timing of the unaccompanied alien children, and obamas executive order and the DHSs solicitation (months before they said they
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       found out) for third party companies to help transport these children into the united states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its odd, to me. A facilitation of a massive amount of children to come across our border, then the executive order you talked about in you OP, then this enterovirus outbreak.

       Yea, somethings fishy about this...
