       "The founders of Los Zetas are Mexican army deserters who received elite training in Mexico and the U.S. The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, formerly School of the Americas, has been the traditional base for Latin American officers who are incorporated by the Pentagon and American intelligence agencies into secret operations whose objective is to impose the strategy of domination without direct military occupation. Or else to combat risks such as terrorism and radical populism.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The U.S. government has warned that in Mexico there is a form of insurgency headed by the narco-trafficking cartels with the potential to take over the government; this would require a military response on the part of the U.S. since the power of Mexico's military and police is limited and inadequate. In this there is a double game of formal and informal discourses and practices, the making explicit of their internal thinking and the retraction in response to the protocols of bilateral relations. For public purposes the discourse effects a geopolitical siege. While all the while its different agencies operate their own agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Since 1959 almost all of America's wars have been induced and undertaken in prioritory fashion by its war machine under the disguise of responses to a supposed enemy aggression and in which appear deceits and the manipulation of important events involving global drug connections. The CIA engages in far-reaching illegal operations, such as the globalization of torture, selective assassinations and other abuses in clandestine prisons, and customarily foments the internal instability of countries for the benefit of immediate and future U.S. interests, be it for reasons of domination and influence or for exploitation and reservation of natural resources. This is the case with Mexican petroleum and gas, which are abundant in the Gulf of Mexico and further inland towards the north. Or that of uranium: in Chihuahua there are more than fifty uraniferous deposits.

       Ahh yes. The founding members of the zetas were part of a special forces unit that was trained by US and Israeli military. These folks defected to the Gulf Cartel but soon figured out that they wielded power amd could use it to gain leverage in the turf wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been seeing this and coming to my own conclusion about the ongoing cartel wars. Private companies will have easier time doing business once rival cartels have been bought by foreign interests.

       All that oil in northern Tamulipas is ready for the taking by foreign companies.  They just need stability in the region.
