<p>One had a penchant for challenging people to fights IRL, no joke. One was the #2 moderator of the fear-based downvote brigades r/Conspiratard <em>and</em> r/EnoughLibertarianSpam. Both relied <em>entirely</em> on name-calling to win arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s scum like these people who are the ones that are truly complicit in the atrocities we see today, by their derailing of discussion and belittling of issues.  It&#39;s disgusting to see people so dedicated to mocking the few who actually care about ending corruption and war, and who try to promote social cooperation and mutual beneficence.  If only they knew how much we would all benefit if they joined us in our pursuit of holding those who hold humanity back accountable.</p>

<p>Edit:  Looks like I&#39;ve been featured on r/conspiratard!  Well, for the record, I will not allow myself to be represented as stooping to the depths of lumping an entire subreddit into a category that I have reserved for a minority of its users (an action, it seems, taken far too often by those in question).  For those who insist on mocking this subreddit, I will tell you now: we are not concerned with &quot;reptilians&quot;, we are not concerned with moon landing hoaxes and the more extreme theories of modern events tend to be a minority view (admittedly, this is not always the case).  This is a short list of the injustices that we wish to see the end of, first and foremost.  If you agree that these issues are pertinent and unacceptable, we invite you to aid in our efforts to post quality information and evidence, and to get the unfortunate minority of nonsense and ignorance out of here.</p>

<li><p>9/11 - I will not speculate about the attacks themselves, however the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_9/11_Commission">flaws in the 9/11 commission</a> are pretty clear and warrant a new investigation by themselves.  Some excerpts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Former FBI] Director Freeh criticized the 9/11 Commission for ignoring key evidence from Able Danger, which he alleged resulted in false statements being made in the final 9/11 Commission report... concluded that these inadequacies raised serious questions about the credibility of the 9/11 Commission.</p>

<p>The Commission was forced to use subpoenas to obtain the cooperation of the FAA and NORAD to release evidence such as audiotapes. The agencies&#39; reluctance to release the tapes—along with e-mails, erroneous public statements and other evidence—led some of the panel&#39;s staff members and commissioners to believe that authorities sought to mislead the commission and the public about what happened on September 11. &quot;I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described,&quot; said John Farmer, a former New Jersey attorney general who led the staff inquiry into events on September 11.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also the fact that the government fought against the movement to even <em>have</em> a 9/11 commission in the first place.  It&#39;s thanks to &quot;twoofers&quot; (read: victim&#39;s families, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Girls">jersey girls</a>) that we even got a 9/11 investigation in the first place!</p>

Also you guys don&#39;t give two fucks about actual corruption like which politicians are getting what money from who and exposing that.  you guys chase bullshit conspiracies like calling parents of murdered children liars and 9/11 was an inside job.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite ignorant of you to deride individuals as anti-semites merely because they post in this sub.  I mean come on, it&#39;s obvious that we do not condone that sort of thing here, says it right on the sidebar:  </p>

I didn&#39;t watch the Hitler documentary nor did I have any interest in it, but do you really think it is that radical an idea that there&#39;s the slightest possibility that history was &quot;written by the winners&quot;?  </p>

<p>If you look at my edit you can see some of the injustices I am concerned with.  I am well aware that we live in <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/21/americas-oligarchy-not-democracy-or-republic-unive/">an effective oligarchy</a>, and if you visited this sub everyday you <em>would</em> realize that we do try to expose that kind of stuff.  But don&#39;t forget that this is also a platform for <strong><em>you</em></strong> to expose the injustices that you see too.  If you&#39;re interested in seeing better content in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, you are welcome to help us by providing quality sourced arguments whose purpose is to find the truth (whether that means debunking or exposing) and to get rid of the minority bigoted view.

<p>This sub - in a general sense - does seem to attract and upvote a lot of highly questionable stuff. As a result, of course, when posting about it elsewhere it&#39;s easy to be lazy and assume all the contributors are of equal opinion, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s generally suggested in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. The majority of stuff posted in that sub is basically, for better or worse, making fun of what many there would consider to be crazy ideas or theories.</p>

<p>The same thing goes on here. Plenty of crowing about the sheeple and the shills supporting the <em>big lie</em> and <em>the powers that be</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been made clear by various people in various ways that this sub is not really interested in engaging in any sort of significant debate. Dissenting commenters are frequently labelled as shills and bans often handed out for minor perceived offensives.</p>

<p>For a while there was a subreddit called <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">/r/conspiratocracy</a> that was ostensibly created with the intention of creating an open discourse. It was slightly successful for a short-time although never attracted significant participation, and the momentum died fairly quickly.</p>

<p>As it is some of us (skeptics or members of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>) will come here from time to time and try to participate. Sometimes it&#39;s well received, sometimes it&#39;s not - but usually it&#39;s futile. This sub is, by design, something of an echo chamber. And even if that were not the specific intention, there are plenty of users who&#39;d like to see it that way and do all they can to make that the case.</p>

<p>I am, however, fairly certain that the grand motives and meaning ascribed to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> by many here is entirely without merit. If there are conspirators running the sub it seems entirely unknown to the majority (or maybe they&#39;re just keeping me out of the loop?)</p>

Seeing so many people go on about how the parents of these dead kids were liars sickened me. Seeing then how this bs from different internet sites spilled into the real world with people harassing these parents is some of the most callous, cruel, and shitty examples of stupidity I&#39;ve ever seen. That is when I realized that most conspiracy theorists care more about feeling superior cause they can &quot;see the truth&quot; than actually finding truth.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, people have taken it too far in some cases.  However, the no kids died theory of sandy hook is a pretty controversial view here; I have seen it trashed a lot.  I do think people have some legitimate questions about that day though.  The conspiracy theorist stigma has been ever present since the CIA introduced it to discredit those who questioned the JFK assassination, so it will always be an uphill battle, this is nothing new.  From my post you can see that the 9/11 commission reeks of a cover-up and yet it is one of the #1 topics <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> mocks us for.  In effect, this adds to the negative stream, belittles the massive issue of a botched investigation and perpetuates this negative stereotype rather than gleaning any actual truth.  For me, it is unconscionable to defend such cowardly acts to avoid accountability for the single largest defense/intelligence failure in the history of this country, if not the planet, either by my silence or by the mocking of people who wish to see these assholes in court for treason because they knew a terror attack was imminent and didn&#39;t do anything about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly sure that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> seldom takes issue with that aspect of 9/11. It&#39;s pretty clear that aspect of the commission were politically limited. </p>

<p>The 9/11 things that would tend to comprise the &#39;#1 topics&#39; would be controlled demolition, magically space energy beams, nuclear weapons (there have been at least three posts to the same article alleging a 150 kiloton nuke was used on 9/11 on the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> this week).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seldom seen &#39;legitimate questions&#39; about Sandy Hook here either. I&#39;ve seen plenty of vitriolic accusations of either murder or massive fraud being levelled at some government agency or another. Constantly posts about one &quot;proof&quot; or another showing that Sandy Hook never happened, or that it did but it was some secret CIA wet ops team.</p>

<p>To suggest that the bulk of posts or comments here are simple political opinions is pretty disingenuous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, the claims about 9/11 that are mocked are often those that are more outlandish, but I still think this is reprehensible.  The constructive thing to do would be to explain why some of those theories are nonsense (as a lot of people here do) and then explain what parts of the 9/11 cover-up <em>are</em> legitimate concerns.  If you have the opportunity to explain why there was actual malfeasance, possibly even treason, and you choose not to acknowledge it or enlighten people with the facts, then you are not showing respect for those who lost their lives on that day nor for this country, whose inane rulers need to be held accountable when they fail to protect us.  Those that believe that nukes and high-energy weapons were used are, at worst, misguided; they are still however correct and noble in principle by supporting a new investigation that isn&#39;t &quot;set up to fail&quot;, that doesn&#39;t have testimony which would bring the credibility of the whole investigation into question, and one that actually acknowledges that WTC 7 collapsed that day, to name a few of the issues.  When you attack the 9/11 truth movement, whose core view is that there must be a new, independent investigation, you are also attacking those with serious, legitimate concerns about the issues with the 9/11 commission.  Far too often these extreme views are seen by critics as being the <em>only</em> evidence that warrants a new investigation, when this couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth.  <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, from what I have seen (I may be mistaken, because I am not concerned with the kind of loonery that is mocked over there, but actual truth) reinforces this negative stereotype and makes no mention of the legitimate concerns surrounding the 9/11 commission.  In the eyes of Ginetta Sagan, that is complicity with the oppression of those who wish to see an open and honest investigation.</p>

<p>Whether someone believes something is &quot;proof&quot; or not does not change the fact that they are speculating.  I admit that I have understated the amount of speculation that goes on here, a decent amount of it consisting of pretty radical ideas.  Nonetheless I think it is important to examine these possibilities, if anything as a thought experiment, to consider for a moment that things may not be how they seem -- similar to the brain in a vat argument, if you are familiar with it.  After all: </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to generalise and suggest that the majority of people in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> don&#39;t believe there is a 9/11 cover up. They quite possibly believe the government was unwilling to publicly acknowledge their failings (although ultimately those failings were made quite clear anyway). </p>

<p>There is not even the remotest shortage of refutations and debunkings of the various 9/11 Truth theories. They are not welcome here, they are outright banned in <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>.</p>

<p>No one doesn&#39;t acknowledge that WTC 7 collapsed. An extensive report was prepared by NIST on the matter. I&#39;ve yet to see a single skeptic or debunker claim any different.</p>

<p>I strongly doubt that the 9/11 truth movement really wants a new investigation - what they want is an investigation that confirms their conclusion. A conclusion that usually seems to be formed more by an existing worldview than by any real evidence.</p>

<p>The problem with that idea is that, basically, this sub doesn&#39;t want that.</p>

<p>Numerous posters in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> have been banned from <em>here</em> for making comments <em>there</em>. Any sign of downvoting here from members of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> attracts screams of &quot;brigade&quot; and &quot;manipulation&quot;. Posts made here that run counter to the prevailing view of the majority are downvoted into obscurity. Even regular <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posters who express opinions that run counter to the majority find themselves being attacked.</p>

<p>Personally I come here occasionally to offer whatever opinions I feel might be tolerated, but I <em>never</em> downvote, and I avoid getting into debates here as it&#39;s very clear to me, as someone who doesn&#39;t share the majority opinion here (basically rooted in the idea that governments are involved in global conspiracy against citizens) that my view is not valued to wanted.</p>

<p>I have no idea why I or others from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> even bother to engage in these matters really. We know we aren&#39;t likely to change any minds, and more often than not our input is met with criticism and downvotes, but we do it anyway. As a result there is <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> where we share our bemusement, amusement and dismay at what we see online (and sometimes in the real world).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is an &#39;attack sub&#39; but I guess commentary in there can get pretty raw at times, but perhaps that&#39;s to be expected when they&#39;re being labelled as &quot;scum&quot; who are &quot;complicit in the atrocities we see today&quot; simply for choosing to hold and share opposing views on the internet.</p>

<p>If you want to expand on my view over there (and you&#39;re not banned? I have no idea) then I say go ahead.</p>

<p>But like I say - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that type of stuff that is generally the focus of the users of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. </p>

<p>The founder and mod team of that subreddit literally created it specifically to defend the 9/11 Commission&#39;s findings (and to a lesser extent to attack and defame anti-war politicians and their supporters as racists). No joke.</p>

<p>There may be a handful of reasonable people there, like yourself, who are just unaware that they are being used like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">useful idiots.</a> That&#39;s one of the main reasons why I created <a href="/r/NolibsWatch">/r/NolibsWatch</a>, so that evidence could be collected and shown to people who could then make the choice to stop tacitly supporting scummy war-pigs.</p>

<p>Since you suffer from this underlying cause of racism, I understand your struggle. When you are so prejudiced yourself, it&#39;s hard not to project that prejudice to turn criticism of the state of Israel into a hatred of all Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The things you bulletpoint are in many cases fairly non-controversial and you would probably find agreement from many members of r/conspiratard on those issues - at least the broad strokes (often the motives ascribed to them might be different). </p>

<p>And I&#39;ve certainly not conducted any scientific study of that stuff here or on r/conspiratard but I&#39;m guessing that threads about those things do not feature heavily on conspiratard and aren&#39;t the ones that attract the skeptic crowd when they&#39;re posted here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll speak for myself - I do have a problem with drone strikes, I am not a supporter of mass surveillance, I don&#39;t want to see child-pornography go uninvestigated, I think the FBI&#39;s actions in terror stings are highly questionable... And so on.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think those sorts of things make up the bulk of what is at the heart of the divide between r/conspiracy and r/conspiratard - instead it&#39;s things like 9/11, Sandy Hook, the Boston Bombing... Vaccines, FEMA camps, ISIS and Ebola.</p>

<p>Those are the things that r/conspiratard clearly likes to make light of, and those are the topics that attract skeptics to comment here (and also see a lot of disagreement within the broader conspiracy community I guess). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll admit I was brought here from conspiritard, and I believe you&#39;re making the same judgements about us that we are (unfairly) about you. Most of us (just like most of you) are making fun of the obviously ridiculous things like moon hoaxes and holocaust denials, but I don&#39;t think anyone over there is denying that the world is seriously fucked up and there are serious and illegal lapses in judgement and moral character taking place in the US (and many if not most other governments). Where you lose me is the 9/11 claims. It&#39;s possible that the commision went too quickly and some details got lost in the noise, but were you old enough to remember the attacks (honest question, I&#39;m not trying to insult I promise!)? People were terrifyed, hence the Patriot Act, but an incomplete report (in your and other like minded eyes) I don&#39;t think is enough to call it a false flag (if that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing). I find it incredibly difficult to believe that what happened in 2001 was anything different from what was reported: Muslim extremists, predominately from Iran and Saudi Arabia, hijacked 4 planes and ran two into the WTC, one into the Pentagon, and one crashed in a field. I have never seen any compelling evidence to sway me in another direction, anm honestly all of the structural &quot;evidence&quot; against the towers being able to collapse with those impacts are seriously wrong (source: I have an MS in mechanical engineering). So may I please apologize for the loud, obnoxious voices on my side, as you did for yours, and can we actually try to stop harassing each other for long enough to talk about actual, serious issues plaguing our society today and what we can do about it?

    <div class="md"><p>I really appreciate your honesty and I agree that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> does not always make fun of these pertinent issues.  This is why I say the ones who are truly complicit are the few who deliberately derail discussions here and not necessarily those who merely mock the people who believe in lizards controlling the world.  </p>

<p>As for 9/11, I already said I would not speculate on the attacks themselves, like whether it was a false flag, let it happen on purpose, etc. as it is too controversial a topic.  However I will say what happened to WTC 7 is very suspicious, and the glaring omission of even mentioning its collapse (one which is unprecedented in over a century of steel structure high-rise buildings) in the 9/11 commission shows how flawed and incomplete the investigation was, and how it did not even closely carry out the extent of its charter &quot;...to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks&quot;.  Couple this with the Able Danger program and other claims I made above, and you can see it is clear that even if you believe the official narrative there is enough evidence of malfeasance in the intelligence community to warrant a new investigation.  There are far more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTJu2Q7CVQw">credible people</a> than me who have admitted that the CIA deliberately withheld information.  And lets not forget about the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHJUAiqPG6o">28 pages redacted</a> from the 9/11 joint inquiry into intelligence activities, which detail the funding of the attacks that remain classified to this day (because exposing and holding accountable those who finance terrorism threatens &quot;national security&quot;) and have been alleged to involve funding from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/us/graham-and-kerrey-see-possible-saudi-9-11-link.html?_r=0">state of Saudi Arabia</a> -- an ally to the US.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier these are facts that show a deliberate effort to mislead, omit and lie about certain events that happened on that day and the intelligence we had on the hijackers leading up to the attack, which is an immense difference compared to &quot;...some details got lost in the noise&quot;.  I would argue this kind of shit is treasonous and unacceptable.  How will our intelligence and defense community improve if they are not held accountable for their massive failures?  How will our democracy improve if we let an administration like Bush&#39;s get away with protecting the name of those who finance terror?</p>

<p>Thank you so much!  Yes, I agree wholeheartedly, and that is why I extend my hand to all of you so that we can come together to expose and fight the injustices of the world today.  As I said earlier, we need more of that here as the world is in turmoil these days and many are dangerously turning toward authoritarianism as a solution.  I think that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the most popular subreddit dedicated to exposing general injustice (but catering more towards injustice which is being covered up) which is why I aim to show those on <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> that our majority view is often very sensible and legitimate, with the aforementioned issues that I see posted on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> every day.  I would love to see more <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> users coming here, helping us keep the kooky things to a minimum, helping us downvote blatant racism and stimulating productive discussion by providing evidence that either refutes certain theories or validates suspected injustice.  I want to thank you again for your kind words and honesty, much love to you as well from the Pleaides!</p>

<p>For example, many people (particularly those on this sub) believe that 9/11 was a planned event.  That being the case, and assuming that there are shills on internet forums defending the official story, then they are lying to protect the actions of mass murderers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s scum like these people who are the ones that are truly complicit in the atrocities we see today, by their derailing of discussion and belittling of issues. It&#39;s disgusting to see people so dedicated to mocking the few who actually care about ending corruption and war, and who try to promote social cooperation and mutual beneficence. If only they knew how much we would all benefit if they joined us in our pursuit of holding those who hold humanity back accountable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only about people who mock conspiracy theorists and the like, the people who OP is calling out and their friends. That is who the guy was equating to murderers. As far as shills go, that&#39;s just advertising, and again not comparable to murder.</p>

<p>Of course not but, in my opinion, an ad exec for McDonald&#39;s (while still a bit morally dubious) is not on the same level as a person who is literally paid to defend the crimes and murders committed by the government/banking/intelligence/military/industrial apparatus.</p>

<p>I mean, defending the Israeli massacre of Palestinian civilians, and doing so <em>knowing full well</em> that you&#39;re essentially defending psychopathic mass murderers, is a bit different from thinking up a catchy jingle to convince people to eat a shitty, processed burger.</p>

<p>I do see your point though and it&#39;s a fine line.  I just have such contempt for someone who would knowingly sell out humanity and protect psychopaths just to cash a paycheck.  That is moral bankruptcy if I&#39;ve ever seen it.</p>

<p>Would you mind helping me show people here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that they need to stop talking about the stupid Smith-Mundt act as it has fuck all to do with anything but the Department of State and Governing Board of Broadcasters, and has absolutely no ability whatsoever to stop any other federal agency from disseminating propaganda domestically?</p>

<p>It seems people here are having a hard time understanding the concept that Smith-Mundt doesn&#39;t and never has stopped the Department of Defense and its&#39; child agencies  from engaging in domestic propaganda.</p>

<p>Sorry to seem to be coming out of nowhere with this but people keep posting shit like &quot;since the repeal of smith-mundt and propaganda is now legal&quot; even though that&#39;s entirely wrong and domestic propaganda has always been legal, find me legislation that states otherwise.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obviously been bothering me that I&#39;ve had to explain it on over 8 separate occasions and people still don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>Seems pretty straight forward to me. We have been receiving propaganda this entire time, and I don&#39;t feel like investigating whether the ACLU is in on some conspiracy, so I think this pretty much settles the question. Dsprox is correct, and I too would like to see this claim that the Smith Mundt act prevents American propaganda proven, because it seems like that is a crock of shit.</p>

<p>Again, you don&#39;t know what you are talking about. The repeal allows foreign-targeted propaganda to lawfully be disseminated within the US. This covers orgs like VOA, and other groups we may operate overseas.  So, obviously, this allows for increased domestic exposure to american made propaganda, since programming made for broadcast in a foreign country, which would have previously been illegal, is now not illegal. You said it has nothing to do with domestic propaganda and you are absolutely wrong.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that Reddit bans IPs, but if they did they could ban any accounts associated with the same IP.  There are a handful of well known over the top racist accounts and subs, and I suspect that at least a few of them are troll accounts associated with these &quot;antisemitism&quot; crusaders.

<p>Of course you&#39;re not saying they couldn&#39;t start new accounts, nice non-denial denial.</p>

<p>No they couldn&#39;t actually because a username being on an IP doesn&#39;t prove anything other than them using that IP, it doesn&#39;t take into account any form of VPN or IP spoofing, thus you can not use it as evidence to link accounts together.</p>

<p>You have to have more evidence such as posting history, writing style, greatest time of activity, and a few other pieces of supporting evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These two excerpts from the article prove that IP alone isn&#39;t enough. It&#39;s a necessary piece of information, but not the sole information which reveals the whole picture, as the text states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next, Brown plugged the IP numbers into one of the specialized search websites--cqcounter.com/whois/--that give a non-numerical &quot;name&quot; of a computer and the name and location of the company, government agency, university, or other institution providing internet service to that computer.</p>

<p>Then a big mistake was discovered. Comments under the screen name HamBaconEggs and a few others had occasionally been posted from an IP address with a name that included a personal email address and a university domain name. Email addresses are often part of the user names given to students and faculty by a university to enable them to access the institution&#39;s computer network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few minutes on Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn led Common Dreams to the owner of the email address, a graduate student at the Midwestern campus. The student also had made the same mistake by using a university computer that had the name of his tiny academic unit.</p>

<p>So right there, the article you use as support to your claims that IP alone is enough reveals that no, IP alone is not enough, especially when the person makes no mistakes that would lead to their IP being used to find them.</p>

<p>So sorry, but you&#39;re wrong. IP association alone is not enough to prove accounts are linked together.</p>

<p>I could legitimately be posting anti-whatever posts while another person is legitimately posting pro-whatever posts in rebuttal under the same ip, should both of us happen to be posting on the same thing at the same time from the same location.</p>

<p>Sounds pretty improbably until you figure in college campuses, work places, public wifi, public schools, etc where a &quot;coincidence&quot; of two people posting on the same thing from the same place could easily happen.</p>

<p>So again, IP association ALONE, is not enough evidence to link accounts together.</p>

<p>To which the IP information is only the first piece of evidence, not full evidence which can stand on its&#39; own, but certainly enough to establish the possibility.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Exactly, they legally can&#39;t use the IP alone as evidence because it&#39;s not enough evidence, in ANY circumstance, even attempting to link two accounts together.</p>

<p>I phrased that incorrectly, it&#39;s enough to establish the possibility of such theories, but not enough evidence to support the theory as being true.</p>

<p>That is not actually right based on what we&#39;ve established, because it could just be coincidence, like people posting from college campuses, you can&#39;t ban accounts solely based on IP connection because that doesn&#39;t take into account any of the factors which explain how that sharing of the IP is legitimate and not proof of the accounts being connected.</p>

<p>That is the only reason why I persist in my stubborn argumentative nature, because I want to be sure what is being established is actually correct and truthful.</p>

<p>Well you CAN ban an IP address.  4chan does it all the time.  But I don&#39;t know if reddit does.  And otherwise, I agree.  An IP ban could affect a swath of people who did not commit an offense. I wasn&#39;t advocating any sort of ban- I was just saying that if it happened, I suspect that we would see a connection between some of the Zionist power user accounts and the Anti-semite power user accounts. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t trying to claim that IP address is automatically personal identifying information.  </p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t think Reddit should shadowban anyone unless they break the law.  But how do the Admins deal with spammers?  Reddit, like many sites, can sometimes be difficult to use with Tor.  Isn&#39;t that because the associated IPs have been banned?  There are certainly situations where many university students or employees may share an IP address, but it would be a hell of a coincidence for two people using the same computer to be anonymous online enemies and not know about it.</p>

<p>but no worries.  we&#39;re basically on the same page.</p>

<p>edit:  I just read OP&#39;s picture and an admin told him that they looked into it and dealt with a &quot;number of connected accounts&quot;.  How else are they connecting the account, other than IP?</p>

<p>By association, it&#39;s so basic I&#39;m not sure how you don&#39;t know, they make it blisteringly obvious how they are connected.</p>

<p>And god forbid you have <strong>the number 88</strong> in your username. </p>

<p><strong>88</strong> is a racist code - like a secret handshake for a certain racist group.</p>

<p>To these people, each letter of their alphabet has a corresponding number (and vice versa), so as the eighth letter of the alphabet is <strong>H</strong> - &quot;<strong>88</strong>&quot; would translate as code for &quot;<strong>HH</strong>&quot; - which, as we all know, is an abbreviation for <strong>H</strong>appy <strong>H</strong>anukkah - holiday that lasts for <strong>8</strong> days, during which <strong>8</strong> candles (or oil lamps) are ceremoniously lit.</p>

<p><strong>88</strong> = HH = Happy Hanukkah</p>

<p>I swear to god!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They frequently like to play racist and stir up racism, so they can turn around and call our sub racist. Part of their culture is to perpetuate very isolated extreme conspiracy ideologies, such as world-wide Jewish takeover conspiracies, so they can continue to broadly generalize everyone who questions anything as being part of the same group with those extremist ideas. Hating and demoralizing a group requires finding the most obviously extreme and unacceptable ideas found within that group, and portraying that as an ideology held by the entire group. It is similar to racism in the way that stereotypes are used to perpetuate racism.</p>

<p>For an example of stereotyping hate-based generalizations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Christians molest little boys.</li>
<li>NFL players beat their wives.</li>
<li>Mexicans are lazy.</li>
<li>Chinese are good at math.</li>
<li>Conspiracy theorists think Jews control the world.</li>
<li>Conspiracy theorists want to kill babies by tricking people into not getting vaccines.</li>
<li>Conspiracy theorist are a danger because they harass victims of Sandy Hook.</li>
</ul>

<p>A common r/conspiratard theme is to trick people into thinking anyone who questions common things is a conspiracy theorist, they refer to with the hate-slur &#39;conspiratard&#39; or just &#39;tard&#39;, then portraying them as dangerous by highlighting the few extremist stereotypes. The key is hating conspiracy theorists and portraying them as dangerous. This sounds like racism in every way to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. This was in my past as well. I asked &quot;why is the slur tard allowed here&quot;. Focusing of course on the predilection to associate this sub with bigotry. They of course assumed insincerity and accused me of &quot;concern trolling&quot; (It should be addressed without addressing the messenger regardless, moot point who says it IMO). My intentions were sincere, I was not concerned but legitimately intrigued.</p>

<p>Being ostracized was something I was prepared for. Their (seemingly aggressive/emotional) reaction was something I was not. There were <em>some</em> respectful outlooks, but I feel it was overwhelmingly ill-received. I was forever hated, followed and discredited by the remaining group closely associated with the banned mods, despite my efforts to establish respect among them. I realized that Herk was an extremely hostile douche who censors out of cowardice. JCM is a GOP loving-Jingoist tool, and the rest are if not all the same user, trollish* ass clowns.</p>

<p>It simply made me realize I had made the right choice in trusting and loving this community regardless of pitfall.</p>

<p>David Cameron recently went in front of the U.N. and said that 9/11 Truth is what drives the ideology behind ISIS, specifically mentioning &quot;Jews did 9/11&quot;, which is very interesting because that particular theory is not talked about very often in the past, but is beginning to look more plausible as people try to answer the question of &quot;How did the WTC&#39;s turn to dust?&quot; combined with 13 years of illogical wars, up to today with ISIS, which as we all know war on Syria was planned soon after 9/11 because Wesley Clark told us </p>

<p>why would r/conspiritard types hate jews</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t hate them, they are obsessed with them because any terminology relating to Judaism has become so loaded that it makes for an effective rhetorical weapon. Their gameplan is and has always been  to defame skeptics of authority as anti-Semites, racists and &quot;<em>h</em>olocaust deniers&quot;. A lot of people just shut down whenever someone is accused of antisemitism and everything becomes irrational and emotional for them, and evidence is <em>not</em> required.</p>

<p>This tactic has devolved over the years into a cookie-cutter &#39;pretend-to-be-antisemitic&#39; circlejerk that happens in nearly every single comment thread on that sub. It happens frequently in other subs too like SubredditDrama and pretty much all over reddit whenever r/conspiracy is in discussion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of them were probably raised in a culture that ingrains this mindset. It&#39;s really sad.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wbur.org/npr/174964910/nathan-englander-stories-of-faith-family-and-the-holocaust?ft=3&amp;amp;f=174964910">http://www.wbur.org/npr/174964910/nathan-englander-stories-of-faith-family-and-the-holocaust?ft=3&amp;amp;f=174964910</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The stories in Nathan Englander&#39;s short collection that&#39;s out now in paperback are based largely on his experiences growing up as a modern Orthodox Jew with an overprotective mother.</p>

<p>In What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank, Englander writes about his own faith — and what it means to be Jewish — in stories that explore religious tension, Israeli-American relations and the Holocaust.</p>

<p>In the title story — a riff on Raymond Carver&#39;s classic What We Talk About When We Talk about Love -- a Hasidic couple and a secular Jewish couple play a morbid game called &quot;Righteous Gentile,&quot; in which they debate who would hide them during an imaginary second Holocaust. Englander says that though he calls it a game in the story, it&#39;s not really a game — and that&#39;s the point.</p>

<p>&quot;I call it a game,&quot; he says, &quot;because it makes it easier to talk about as a game — but it&#39;s something we play with <strong>dead seriousness</strong> in my family — <strong>we would wonder who would hide us in the Holocaust.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Englander, a fourth- or fifth-generation American, says despite his family&#39;s longstanding roots in the United States, <strong>they frequently played the mind exercise when he was little.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;<strong>We really were raised with the idea of a looming second Holocaust</strong>, and we would play this game wondering who would hide us,&quot; he says. &quot;I remember my sister saying about a couple we knew, &#39;He would hide us, and she would turn us in.&#39; And it struck me so deeply, and I just couldn&#39;t shake that thought for all these years, because it&#39;s true.&quot;</p>

<p>No, not at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just accused me of &quot;throwing JIDF around too much&quot;.</p>

<p>Which you responded to, to which I then responded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this truly is the one and only time you&#39;ve used it, sorry, otherwise don&#39;t be a liar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did &quot;make it up&quot; for the fact that I just thought wrong, it was an earnest mistake, which is why I apologized, only with the addendum because I trust no user that&#39;s a big name unless I&#39;ve had more than interaction with said user to establish otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which by definition makes you a liar. It&#39;s not fucking rocket science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why I asked for the clarification to whether or not you were accusing me of lying once, or being a liar in general, or being a liar on accident which is actually the case.</p>

<p>Again, sorry about the false accusation, I only made it because whenever I see JIDF throw out like that for what seems like no valid reason, I become suspicious as to why the claim is being made.</p>

<p>Honest mistake man, my bad.</p>

They use ad hominem because they cant defeat the poster&#39;s argument, so they just try to discredit the poster himself, so no one even reads the initial argument. They&#39;re small minded, racist, narcissistic Internet trolls who only feel happy when they make others feel bad.</p>

<p>Legally, a more rigorous process is necessary when it comes to convicting someone of a crime using an IP address as circumstantial evidence.  But it&#39;s still often enough identifying information to get a warrant](<a href="http://www.legalnews.com/washtenaw/682176">http://www.legalnews.com/washtenaw/682176</a>)</p>

<p>again- you said &gt; An IP association alone is not enough evidence to support such theories.</p>

<p>but it is. It would absolutely be enough evidence to support those theories.  That&#39;s exactly the evidence common dreams had to support the theory.  They went further and identified the person associated with the IP address and he admitted it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve made the context clear and explained my position. That may skew the outcome, but I&#39;m interested to see what happens anyway.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a semi-regular poster in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, so I don&#39;t know if that will also result in a difference in the way it&#39;s received... Or maybe the whole thing will be ignored.</p>

<p>If you want to expand on my view over there (and you&#39;re not banned? I have no idea) then I say go ahead.</p>

<p>But like I say - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that type of stuff that is generally the focus of the users of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. </p>

<p>Many of us probably agree on the issues with matters like mass surveillance, police violence, excessive corporate power and so on. The difference - I suspect - is the reasons and motives we ascribe to those things, as well as the eventual outcomes of them.</p>

<p>The founder and mod team of that subreddit literally created it specifically to defend the 9/11 Commission&#39;s findings (and to a lesser extent to attack and defame anti-war politicians and their supporters as racists). No joke.</p>

<p>There may be a handful of reasonable people there, like yourself, who are just unaware that they are being used like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">useful idiots.</a> That&#39;s one of the main reasons why I created <a href="/r/NolibsWatch">/r/NolibsWatch</a>, so that evidence could be collected and shown to people who could then make the choice to stop tacitly supporting scummy war-pigs.</p>

<p>Good luck! </p>
