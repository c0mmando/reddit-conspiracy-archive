      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Our first task is to draw a vivid portrait and make an emotional connection. We should rely on emotionally powerful language, feelings and images to bring home the terrible impact of gun violence. Compelling facts should be used to back up that emotional narrative, not as a substitute for it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The notion that today’s weapons are different in kind from what was available in the past is an especially powerful idea and helps make the case for new levels of concern and scrutiny around access to weapons. …
       </p>
       <p>
        Alarming facts open the door to action. And powerful stories put feeling and emotional energy behind those facts…
       </p>
       <p>
        It’s not just about words, powerful and emotionally engaging images are vitally important and reinforces strong messages. For example, intimidating images of military-style weapons help bring to life the point that we are dealing with a different situation than in earlier times.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the run-up to the 2008 elections, Turton was highly sought after as Washington lobbying shops prepared for a Democratic takeover. Insiders estimated then that Turton could bring home somewhere near $500,000 if he went downtown. He declined to say what he is making in his new job as vice president for federal government affairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        In his new gig, Turton will represent an $11 billion company that owns and operates electric power plants and is the second largest generator of nuclear energy in the country. The company will benefit from Turton’s insider knowledge as Congress considers whether to change nuclear policy in the wake of the multiple nuclear incidents caused by this month’s devastating Japanese tsunami.
       </p>
       <p>
        The move comes two months after Turton’s wife, Ashley, was killed in an accidental car fire.

Levy County, Florida (Progress Energy) 
The COL application was submitted to the NRC on 30 July 2008.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Progress Energy's intention to seek a COL for new reactors in its Florida marketing area was announced in August 2005, when Progress also announced plans to investigate expanding its Shearon Harris site in North Carolina. In May 2007, two Westinghouse AP 1000 units were announced. Subsequently, initial clearance for the project has been obtained from Levy County officials. On 5 June 2008, the NRC held a public meeting on the Levy application.6 In April 2010, Progress Energy announced that the anticipated schedule has delayed and the cost estimates have been revised upward. The original estimate was $17.2 billion but, under the new estimate the costs can range up to $22.5 billion. Progress Energy now plans to start Levy 1 in 2021 and Levy 2 about 18 months later. In April 2010, Progress Energy informed its customers that they will see lower bills in 2011 as a direct result of a decision to postpone major construction activities on the Levy County plant until after the licensing progress is completed.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The report states that solar developers already are offering to sell utilities electricity for 14 cents per kilowatt hour or less, yet Duke Energy and Progress Energy are moving forward with plans for nuclear plants that would generate electricity at a higher cost: 14 cents to 18 cents per kilowatt hour.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bottom line is: Solar power is now cheaper than new nuclear power, particularly in North Carolina," Jim Warren, executive director of the N.C. Waste Awareness and Reduction Network, said during a conference call. Today's report is the organization's latest salvo in its ongoing campaign against nuclear and coal-fired plants.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report was authored by John Blackburn, a former chairman of Duke University's economics department as well as the university's former chancellor. He also has written two books on renewable energy.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The ruling would certainly kill existing power companies who have placed huge resources into funding new nuclear sites like Duke Energy and Progress Energy which 2 days after Gifford’s is shot, the 2 companies announced a merger. And guess who works for the new merged companies? Ashley Turton.

        ROSA DELAURO
       </strong>
       DeLauro's former Chief of staff,
       <strong>
        Ashley Turton
       </strong>
       …
      </p>
      <p>
       Ashley Turton was married to Dan Turton, who worked for the WhiteHouse until April, 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dan Turton serves as President Barack Obama’s point man for guiding his legislative agenda through the House. Though he was officially appointed to the job in January 2009, Turton started working well before that date with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to convince key players to support the president’s $800 billion economic stimulus package.

       Turton was burned to death in her own driveway on Jan. 10, 2011, a mere two days after the shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Gifford (D-AZ) occurred in a Tucson grocery store parking lot, an incident in which a girl named Christina Taylor Green who was born on 9-11 was killed; Taylor-Green's father just happens to be a scout for the LA Dodgers and her grandfather is former manage the Phillies, the New York Yankees, and the New York Mets. January 10, 2011 Ashley Turton had planned to drive to the airport for an air trip related to her work. Instead, a neighbor telephoned at 4:49 a.m. to report Turton's garage was on fire. Inside the garage, firefighters discovered her body in her 2008 BMW X5 SUV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her death was investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department with assistance from the city fire department, two BMW engineers, and the ATF. The death of a lobbyist in a Capitol Hill garage fire last month has been ruled ACCIDENTAL by the D.C. medical examiner's office, which said Friday that 37-year-old Ashley Turton died from "thermal burns" and inhaling "products of combustion." found “acute alcohol intoxication” and said she died from “inhalation of products of combustion and thermal burns.” According to authorities, there was no indication of foul play and there were "no obvious signs of trauma". So…. the "low-speed" collision apparently ignited the fire, Piringer said. WTOP radio has reported that experts are exploring the possibility that antifreeze spilled from the SUV's damaged radiator and was ignited by heat from an exposed headlight bulb. There were other flammable substances in the garage.”

        A highly regarded former Democratic staffer, Ashley Turton worked as an aide to former Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) and then as chief of staff to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.). At the time of her death, she was a lobbyist for Progress Energy, a North Carolina-based utility company.
       </p>
       <p>
        The autopsy on that body has been completed. However, the cause and manner of death are ‘pending’ at this time,” said Beverly Fields, a spokeswoman for the D.C. Medical Examiner’s office. She wouldn’t confirm it was Turton but Fields said she believed there was a “tentative identification.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In her eulogy of her former chief of staff, DeLauro spoke of someone who could exude the mannerisms of the “southern belle” but who was also politically attuned. DeLauro said that Ashley’s two favorite expressions belied her on-the-surface Southern charm: “shit fire” and “rat bastard.” DeLauro said that she had not heard such language “since Rahm Emanuel moved out of Stan’s and my basement.” DeLauro’s reference was to the rent-free use by Emanuel of her and her husband, Democratic lobbyist Stan Greenberg’s, townhouse, while Emanuel was a congressman from the Illinois 5th congressional district from 2003 to 2008. Emanuel’s use of DeLauro’s townhouse while he was a member of the House and in charge of doling out or withholding Democratic Party funds to candidates around the country; the presence of Greenberg’s partner Carville and Rove at the Arizona political confab attended by Ashley Turton’s just five days before her suspicious death, the question will always remain: What “juicy gossip” might have Ashley Turton taken with her to the grave?

       <p>
        You might be interested in seeing responses to my email I sent the Judiciary Committee and our three representatives in D.C.; Rosa DeLauro; Thank you for contacting me. I appreciate hearing your views on this important issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am a firm supporter of our Second Amendment rights as Americans. The manufacturing and use of firearms has a special place in Connecticut’s history and, with this in mind, I oppose legislation that infringes upon a citizen’s right to keep and bear arms. Gun regulations that I support are common-sense safety measures that will help keep our families safe and help take guns away from criminals.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that the tragedy that happened in Arizona earlier this year has made it clear that we must put in place reasonable laws that protect Second Amendment rights while also doing more to ensure the safety of our families, friends, and communities. You should know that I am a cosponsor of the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act introduced by Representative Carolyn McCarthy of New York. This legislation would bring the nation to the same 10-round-maximum standard of ammunition that is used in four other states today, as well as nationwide for a decade while the previous federal assault weapons ban was in effect. This legislation has been referred to the Judiciary Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can be sure that I will continue to keep your views in mind as Congress considers legislation that may affect Second Amendment rights. I believe that Congress has an obligation to examine ways to improve gun laws while also ensuring that they do not violate Constitutional rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you for taking the time to contact me. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future with your concerns on this issue or any other matter.

       Introduced by Rosa DeLauro whose husband Stanley Greenburg works for Monsanto.
The bill is monstrous on level after level - the power it would give to Monsanto, the criminalization of seed banking, the prison terms and confiscatory fines for farmers, the 24 hours GPS tracking of their animals, the easements on their property to allow for warrantless government entry, the stripping away of their property rights, the imposition by the filthy, greedy industrial side of anti-farming international "industrial" standards to independent farms - the only part of our food system that still works, the planned elimination of farmers through all these means.
