    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I like the slow burner effect that is happening with the NSA stories. Keeps it in the public eye for longer. As opposed to blowing ones load so to speak, as we saw with Wikileaks. </p>

<p>If Snowden simply released all the information he had in one go, I dare say we would not be hearing about it in the MSM still. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you are saying here, but I disagree.  This slow burner effect, as you call it, is just like boiling a frog.  The Elite know full well that humans adapt to their surrounds quite naturally and effortlessly, given the right stimuli.  It is my opinion that this slow leak is actually an acclimation process.</p>

<p>For instance, since Snowden has anything changed?  Where is the outrage?  Where are the indictments?  Has anyone so much as lost their job?  Has the spying stopped?  The only change I&#39;ve noticed is that the common folk know it about.  These people are beginning to adapt to a world of constant surveillance.  The longer we wait for truly damning evidence (which I have yet to see), the less the common man cares.        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely see your point. </p>

<p>But the very fact its being discussed and debated in Washington and London, and the fact the Guardian in the UK for example, as well as the BBC, have been fairly good in their reporting of it, is something. I don&#39;t know what the reporting has been like in the US. </p>

<p>Not to mention the recent news that Apple has reinforced its approach to privacy and made encryption on IOS 8 stronger as a result. I believe Apple are claiming that even if they wanted to hand over data from users with IOS 8 to law enforcement, they couldn&#39;t anymore due to the changes made. The current director of the FBI has been very angry by this decision (this story is fresh, I&#39;m sure you can find it). </p>

<p>The private sphere seem to be responding well to it, Google also have said that they are going to take measures to strengthen their privacy policies etc. I do no that companies like Facebook and Google have been implicated in the NSA leaks and it appears that they might have been colluding with the US government, or that the US government has forced them to comply. </p>

<p>Europe, from what we have seen published over the last year, seem to be pretty pissed off about it and it&#39;s being discussed a lot within the EU. Again, I know they are all at it at some level. </p>

<p>But the NSA has been in the news for so long now, I&#39;d imagine that if Snowden and his cohorts released everything in one go, then right now everyone would be talking about the NSA revelations just as much as Wikileaks, I.e., it&#39;s virtually non existent in the public arena right now. </p>

<p>I just hope that this slow burner effect is leading to something huge. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I didn&#39;t explicitly acknowledge your point, but I think your idea is that this slow outpouring of leaks will somehow acclimatize the public very slowly into simply excepting that spying on citizens is just part of normal life. I agree that that is possible, which is why I hope your wrong and that eventually some good is going to come out of all of this by an unprecedented insight into the wrong doings of government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve made some good points, but I&#39;m pretty suspicious of these corporations racing to the rescue, or reporting the news.  Seems contrived and easy to manage.  Especially since these corporations are guilty of helping the NSA in the past.  Sounds like a PR stunt to me.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who to trust less.  Government, or corporations?  That&#39;s a hard one since they are both owned by the same interests, the Elite.  This includes the media.  It&#39;s not like <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/07/22/333741495/before-snowden-the-whistleblowers-who-tried-to-lift-the-veil">NSA Whistleblowers are anything new</a>.  Why focus so much on Snowden?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I need to do more research into the NSA leaks, specifically with their operations like Prism and others. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how strong the evidence is that tech companies were in bed with the NSA, I know that their names appeared on a few NSA power point slides. But they have all denied it, of course they would though. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know who in these organisations was working with the government and whether it was even voluntary. I suspected from earlier reports that the US have found access to these corporations through back channels. </p>

<p>And I know that Government&#39;s had been diverting all internet track at the infrastructure level, i.e. tapping fiber optic cables, here in the UK anyway. </p>

<p>I doubt, but I could be wrong, that Mark Zuckerberg is directly involved in this scandal for example. But don&#39;t quote me on any of this of course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Presumably, he has documents that, if revealed, would possibly cause harm to others. Then, since you can&#39;t call him a CIA psyop agent, you&#39;d probably call him a Russian agent just so you can be edgy. </p>

<p>Even if that isn&#39;t true, and you would simply be happy that he revealed everything, the media would stomp all over him. So, they have to carefully sift through the documents, make sure they understand them, and make sure they write accurately about them. If he, Greenwald, wrote one shitty, inaccurate article just so that he could appease you and get the info out faster, the media, again, would stomp all over him for being an idiot and the rest of the things written would be considered &quot;possibly inaccurate garbage&quot; by the majority of the world. </p>

<p>Also, their rebuttal to this is that the public needs to be constantly informed and given enough time to take everything in. A quick dump would be forgotten in a month. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if it was 5 percent, that&#39;s probably what should be expected. Dumping everything would &quot;possibly put people in danger,&quot; and the public would turn against him. Also, there&#39;s probably a shit load of material that they are unsure if they should publish. Imagine if you had the job of weighing the costs and benefits of publishing tons of secret information, and can&#39;t know whether some of it should be kept secret to protect the US. Also, imagine it was your job to read all of this material, write articles on it after you understand it, and make sure what you write is accurate so that your reputation isn&#39;t tarnished. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say, in total after this story is over, we might only see 10 or 15 percent of documents actually made public. For if one piece of information that is leaked could be reasonably tied to a future terrorist attack because they were given information they otherwise wouldn&#39;t have, the US would have reason to justify even more secrecy.</p>

<p>If all the documents they have were released in one go, then I&#39;d suspect the story would be brushed under the rug within a matter of months, which would not be good. </p>

<p>But that exact thing has already happened. The majority of people are sick to death of hearing the name Snowden every time a new article comes outs.  The people leaking the info slowly have already lost the attention of the majority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who exactly is sick to death about hearing the name Edward Snowden? The US government, good!</p>

<p>If the public is sick to death about the revelations, I don&#39;t know how we could possibly know that. You&#39;ll know when people really are sick death about it, it&#39;ll be when we stop hearing about Edward Snowden and the NSA. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just hoping that this slow burner effect will eventually pay off and we&#39;ll get a real unprecedented insight into the US government.</p>

<p>Everyday average people in the real world. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>millions have already tune out any Snowden news they come accross.</p>

<p>What slow burner effect? Almost no one is talking about the leaks any more outside of the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outside of the internet? Are you just saying that people you know are not talking about him? If so, I&#39;m not sure that is representative. </p>

<p>You must know a lot of people lol. </p>

<p>NSA leaks are still in the MSM almost on a daily basis (I searched the BBC and the Guardian search engines to see how many stories involved the NSA leaks in September and there were plenty), I&#39;m not sure if this is reflected in the US MSM. </p>

<p>It effects a lot of other stories. Take for example <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/30/iphone-6-encrypted-phone-data-default">Apples</a> recent IOS 8 release and their privacy update for it. The NSA leaks have played a part in the release of IOS 8. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29196748">This</a> story was published in September, as well as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29204971">this</a> one. That&#39;s just two among many of that month. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/15/world/asia/new-zealand-dotcom-snowden-key/index.html?iref=allsearch">This</a> was published in September on CNN. </p>

<p>Google <a href="http://www.google.com/#q=edward+snowden&amp;amp;tbm=nws">news search</a> shows how the story is still being widely published. </p>

<p>Again, I doubt those articles would exist if Snowden had leaked all documents in one fell swoop. </p>

<p>with them in the hands of who they are i doubt we will ever see more than half, probably not even that much. snowden himself has taken to doing &quot;verbal leaks&quot; he can&#39;t be very happy with the progress situation either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I need to do more research into the NSA leaks, specifically with their operations like Prism and others. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how strong the evidence is that tech companies were in bed with the NSA, I know that their names appeared on a few NSA power point slides. But they have all denied it, of course they would though. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know who in these organisations was working with the government and whether it was even voluntary. I suspected from earlier reports that the US have found access to these corporations through back channels. </p>

<p>And I know that Government&#39;s had been diverting all internet track at the infrastructure level, i.e. tapping fiber optic cables, here in the UK anyway. </p>

<p>I doubt, but I could be wrong, that Mark Zuckerberg is directly involved in this scandal for example. But don&#39;t quote me on any of this of course. </p>
