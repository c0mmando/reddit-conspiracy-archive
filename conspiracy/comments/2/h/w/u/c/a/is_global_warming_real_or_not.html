<p>The real problem with global warming is that politicians like to use it to push hidden agendas. Like all other regulations, politicians are taking bids from corporations to see which ones should benefit with the next big round of global warming legislature. </p>

<p>The scariest part is that human activity is most definitely having a negative impact on our planet, and there is nothing we can do about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really climate change... it&#39;s the general destruction of our planet. They call it climate change to convince you it&#39;s something like Al Gore put out, but there&#39;s a whole lot more going on than just CO2. As a matter of fact, CO2 emissions aren&#39;t even the major player in all of it... It&#39;s animal agriculture... but you hardly ever hear that. The root cause of deforestation? Animal agriculture. The thing that uses the most water? Animal agriculture. Oil? Animal agriculture takes a hell of a lot. Wild animals being hunted and displaced? Animal agriculture. Most toxic waste produced? Animal agriculture. Something like 90% of the missing Brazilian rainforest is now cattle farms, and something like a quarter of the planet or so is devoted to animal agriculture.</p>

<p>Cowspiracy opened my eyes big time on that one, yet big agriculture continues to silence and destroy peoples lives for mentioning it while paying off the big environmental groups to hush or die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but I am old enough to remember that and you&#39;re partially incorrect. Yes, the MSM was all about &quot;we&#39;re heading into an ice age&quot;, but basically it was all hype and they got it wrong, by listening to a minority of scientists talking about global cooling.</p>

<p>The majority of scientists were talking about global warming at that point. Unfortunately stories where you could put a polar bear in the middle of a frozen desert on the picture were more eye-grabbing, so the media kept going down that route.</p>

<p>So my confidence is based on facts, thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, you&#39;re getting tetchy over a very small point.</p>

<p>I can already tell the content of your link without clicking it (a hover is more than sufficient). It will show a greater number of people talking about global warming instead of climate change. Do you think you&#39;re the first person to use it?</p>

<p>But you see, that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve just been saying. The majority of people are picking up on incorrect terms and flapping their gums about it, leading to lots of mentions of &quot;global warming&quot;.</p>

<p>Unfortunately again, their opinions only matter in the way they&#39;re obscuring the issue. Which is somewhat damaging.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I won&#39;t be here to see climate change cause the real damage it has the potential to do. I have no descendants, and I&#39;m the last generation of my family. However, I do care about the successful continuation of my species, so I would like people to perhaps do something about it, instead of the current measures which are precisely <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather problematic climate change wasn&#39;t happening. It would be very easy to say that it won&#39;t affect me personally much, and so not give a fig about it. However, I&#39;m not really into the whole denial thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Climate change/global warming is without a doubt, real (despite some scientists being paid to twist the facts for other interests), natural, and accelerated by humans. I have an inkling that the source of deniers are holding hands with the oil and gas companies in an attempt to sway the (ignorant) public into delaying or preventing the end of the oil/gas era. These companies (oil and gas aren&#39;t alone in this either, there are many factors causing this) have a strong influence on how the world works and they&#39;d prefer to retain their control for as long as they can....even if it means accelerating climate change into an irreversible feedback loop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; is real, but I&#39;m unsure as to whether it would be a cause for warming once all other forces are factored in.</p>

<p>My opinion is that it is a huge red herring. It crushes me that the world&#39;s environmentalists are so enchanted with this crisis that they seemingly have little energy left for anything else. While the environment is being destroyed around us, the only ones who supposedly care are stuck looking at the sky. It&#39;s more important for them to win this useless academic battle than to do anything about the myriad real problems we face.</p>

<p>And then, small victories like a carbon tax or emissions trading scheme make us feel like we&#39;ve done all that&#39;s necessary to fix the environment. It&#39;s an undeserved satisfaction and further weakens the environmentalist movement.</p>

<p>I feel like big business knows this and facetiously perpetuates the debate. The environmentalists fall for it hook, line, sinker, rod and copy of Angling Times. It&#39;s so, so pathetic and I really wonder how people who are supposedly scientists can be this politically stupid.</p>

<p>Change the fucking battle! We should all just stop talking about climate change and talk about something else, like, perhaps oceanic pollution and overfishing. There&#39;s going to be no tuna left, soon, and no one gives a shit.</p>
