        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Rothschild family has played a crucial role in international finance for two centuries, as Frederick Morton, in The Rothschilds writes:
&quot;For the last one hundred and fifty years the history of the House of Rothschild has been to an amazing extent the backstage history of Western Europe.&quot;38 (Preface)... Because of their success in making loans not to individuals, but to nations, they reaped huge profits, although as Morton writes, p. 36, &quot;Someone once said that the wealth of Rothschild consists of the bankruptcy of nations.&quot;43
E.C. Knuth writes, in The Empire of the City, &quot;The fact that the House of Rothschild made its money in the great crashes of history and the great wars of history, the very periods when others lost their money, is beyond question.&quot;44</p>

<p>The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia, states, &quot;The clearest example of a personal linkup (international directorates) on a Western European scale is the Rothschild family. The London and Paris branches of the Rothschilds are bound not just by family ties but also by personal link-ups in jointly controlled companies.&quot;45 The encyclopaedia further described these companies as international monopolies.</p>

<p>The sire of the family, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, established a small business as a coin dealer in Frankfurt in 1743. Although previously known as Bauer*, he advertised his profession by putting up a sign depicting an eagle on a red shield, an adaptation of the coat of arms of the City of Frankfurt, to which he added five golden arrows extending from the talons, signifying his five sons. Because of this sign, he took thename ‘Rothschild&quot; or &quot;Red Shield&quot;. When the Elector of Hesse earned a fortune by renting Hessian mercenaries to the British to put down the rebellion in the American colonies, Rothschild was entrusted with this money to invest. He made an excellent profit both for himself and the Elector, and attracted other accounts. In 1785 he moved to a larger house, 148 Judengasse, a five story house known as &quot;The Green Shield&quot; which he shared with the Schiff family.</p>

<p>The five sons established branches in the principal cities of Europe, the most successful being James in Paris and Nathan Mayer in London. Ignatius Balla in The Romance of the Rothschilds46 tells us how the London Rothschild established his fortune. He went to Waterloo, where the fate of Europe hung in the balance, saw that Napoleon was losing the battle, and rushed back to Brussels. At Ostend, he tried to hire a boat to England, but because of a raging storm, no one was willing to go out. Rothschild offered 500 francs, then 700, and finally 1,000 francs for a boat. One sailor said, &quot;I will take you for 2000 francs; then at least my widow will have something if we are drowned.&quot; Despite the storm, they crossed the Channel.</p>

<p>The next morning, Rothschild was at his usual post in the London Exchange. Everyone noticed how pale and exhausted he looked. Suddenly, he started selling, dumping large quantities of securities. Panic immediately swept the Exchange. Rothschild is selling; he knows we have lost the Battle of Waterloo. Rothschild and all of his known agents continued to throw securities onto the market. Balla says, &quot;Nothing could arrest the disaster. At the same time he was quietly buying up all securities by means of secret agents whom no one knew. In a single day, he had gained nearly a million sterling, giving rise to the saying, ‘The Allies won the Battle of Waterloo, but it was really Rothschild who won.’&quot;*</p>

<p>In The Profits of War, Richard Lewinsohn says, &quot;Rothschild’s war profits from the Napoleonic Wars financed their later stock speculations. Under Metternich, Austria after long hesitation, finally agreed to accept financial direction from the House of Rothschild.&quot;*</p>

<p>*Ignatius Balla, The Romance of the Rothschilds, Everleigh Nash, London, 1913
* The New York Times, April 1, 1915 reported that in 1914, Baron Nathan Mayer de Rothschild went to court to suppress Ignatius Balla’s book on the grounds that the Waterloo story about his grandfather was untrue and libelous. The court ruled that the story was true, dismissed Rothschild’s suit, and ordered him to pay all costs. The New York Times noted in this story that &quot;The total Rothschild wealth has been estimated at $2 billion.&quot; A previous story in The New York Times (May 27, 1905) noted that Baron Alphonse de Rothschild, head of the French house of Rothschild, possessed $60 million in American securities in his fortune, although the Rothschilds reputedly were not active in the American field. This explains why their agent, J.P. Morgan, had only $19 million in securities in his estate when he died in 1913, and securities handled by Morgan were actually owned by his employer, Rothschild.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>CONTINUED </p>

<p>After the success of his Waterloo exploit, Nathan Mayer Rothschild gained control of the Bank of England through his near monopoly of &quot;Consols&quot; and other shares. Several &quot;central&quot; banks, or banks which had the power to issue currency, had been started in Europe: The Bank of Sweden, in 1656, which began to issue notes in 1661, the earliest being the Bank of Amsterdam, which financed Oliver Cromwell’s seizure of power in England in 1649, ostensibly because of religious differences. Cromwell died in 1657 and the throne of England was re-established when Charles II was crowned in 1660. He died in 1685. In 1689, the same group of bankers regained power in England by putting King William of Orange on the throne. He soon repaid his backers by ordering the British Treasury to borrow 1,250,000 pounds from these bankers. He also issued them a Royal Charter for the Bank of England, which permitted them to consolidate the National debt (which had just been created by this loan) and to secure payments of interest and principal by direct taxation of the people. The Charter forbade private goldsmiths to store gold and to issue receipts, which gave the stockholders of the Bank of England a money monopoly. The goldsmiths also were required to store their gold in the Bank of England vaults. Not only had their privilege of issuing circulating medium been taken away by government decree, but their fortunes were now turned over to those who had supplanted them.*</p>

<p>In his &quot;Cantos&quot;, 46; 27, Ezra Pound refers to the unique privileges which William Paterson advertised in his prospectus for the Charter of the Bank of England:
&quot;Said Paterson Hath benefit of interest on all the moneys which it, the bank, creates out of nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;nothing&quot; which is referred to, of course, is the bookkeeping operation of the bank, which &quot;creates&quot; money by entering a notation that it has &quot;lent&quot; you one thousand dollars, money which did not exist until the bank made the entry.</p>

<p>By 1698, the British Treasury owed 16 million pounds sterling to the Bank of England. By 1815, principally due to the compounding of interest, the debt had risen to 885 million pounds sterling. Some of this increase was due to the wars which had flourished during that period, including the Napoleonic Wars and the wars which England had fought to retain its American Colony.</p>

<p>William Paterson (1658-1719) himself benefited little from &quot;the moneys which the bank creates out of nothing&quot;, as he withdrew, after a policy disagreement, from the Bank of England a year after it was founded. A later William Paterson became one of the framers of the United States Constitution, while the name lingers on, like the pernicious central bank itself.
Paterson had found himself unable to work with the Bank of England’s stockholders. Many of them remained anonymous, but an early description of the Bank of England stated it was &quot;A society of about 1330 persons, including the King and Queen of England, who had 10,000 pounds of stock, the Duke of Leeds, Duke of Devonshire, Earl of Pembroke, and the Earl of Bradford.&quot;
Because of his success in his speculations, Baron Nathan Mayer de Rothschild, as he now called himself, reigned as the supreme financial power in London. He arrogantly exclaimed, during a party in his mansion, &quot;I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man that controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply.&quot;</p>

<p>His brother James in Paris had also achieved dominance in French finance. In Baron Edmond de Rothschild, David Druck writes, &quot;(James) Rothschild’s wealth had reached the 600 million mark. Only one man in France possessed more. That was the King, whose wealth was 800 million. The aggregate wealth of all the bankers in France was 150 million less than that of James Rothschild. This naturally gave him untold powers, even to the extent of unseating governments whenever he chose to do so. It is well known, for example, that he overthrew the Cabinet of Prime Minister Thiers.&quot;*</p>

<p>The expansion of Germany under Bismarck was accompanied by his dependence on Samuel Bleichroder, Court Bankers of the Prussian Emperor, who had been known as an agent of the Rothschilds since 1828. The later Chancellor of Germany, Dr. von Bethmann Hollweg, was the son of Moritz Bethmann of Frankfurt, who had intermarried with the Rothschilds. Emperor Wilhelm I also relied heavily on Bischoffsheim, Goldschmidt, and Sir Ernest Cassel of Frankfurt, who emigrated to England and became personal banker to the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII. Cassel’s daughter married Lord Mountbatten, giving the family a direct relationship to the present British Crown.</p>

<p>Josephson* states that Philip Mountbatten was related through the Cassels to the Meyer Rothschilds of Frankfurt. Thus, the English royal House of Windsor has a direct family relationship to the Rothschilds. In 1901, when Queen Victoria’s son, Edward, became King Edward VII, he re-established the Rothschild ties.</p>

<p>Paul Emden in Behind The Throne says, &quot;Edward’s preparation for his metier was quite different from that of his mother, hence he ‘ruled’ less than she did. Gratefully, he retained around him men who had been with him in the age of the building of the Baghdad Railway...there were added to the advisory staff Leopold and Alfred de Rothschild, various members of the Sassoon family, and above all his private financial advisor Sir Ernest Cassel.&quot;*</p>

<p>The enormous fortune which Cassel made in a relatively short time gave him an immense power which he never misused. He amalgamated the firm of Vickers Sons with the Naval Construction Company and the Maxim-Nordenfeldt Guns and Ammunition Company, a fusion from which there arose the worldwide firm of Vickers Sons and Maxim. On an entirely different capacity from Cassel were businessmen like the Rothschilds. The firm was run on democratic principles, and the various partners all had to be members of the family. With great hospitality and in a princely manner they led the lives of grand seigneurs, and it was natural that Edward VII should find them congenial. Thanks to their international family relationships and still more extended business connections, they knew the whole world, were well informed about everybody, and had reliable knowledge of matters which did not appear on the surface. This combination of finance and politics had been a trademark of the Rothschilds from the very beginning. The House of Rothschild always knew more than could be found in the papers and even more than could be read in the reports which arrived at the Foreign Office. In other countries also the relations of the Rothschilds extended behind the throne. Not until numerous diplomatic publications appeared in the years after the war did a wider public learn how strongly Alfred de Rothschild’s hand affected the politics of Central Europe during the twenty years before the war (World War I).&quot;</p>

<p>With the control of the money came the control of the news media. Kent Cooper, head of the Associated Press, writes in his autobiography, Barriers Down, &quot;International bankers under the House of Rothschild acquired an interest in the three leading European agencies.&quot;*
Thus the Rothschilds bought control of Reuters International News Agency, based in London, Havas of France, and Wolf in Germany, which controlled the dissemination of all news in Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Inside Europe*, John Gunther wrote in 1936 that any French prime minister, at the end of 1935, was a creature of the financial oligarchy, and that this financial oligarchy was dominated by twelve regents, of whom six were bankers, and were headed by Baron Edmond de Rothschild.</p>

<p>The iron grip of the &quot;London Connection&quot; on the media was exposed in a recent book by Ben J. Bagdikian The Media Monopoly, described as &quot;A startling report on the 50 corporations that control what America sees, hears, reads&quot;.* Bagdikian, who edited the nation’s most influential magazine the Saturday Evening Post until the monopoly suddenly closed it down, reveals the interlocking directorates among the fifty corporations which control the news, but fails to trace them back to the five London banking houses which control them. He mentions that CBS interlocks with the Washington Post, Allied Chemical, Wells Fargo Bank, and others, but does not tell the reader that Brown Brothers Harriman controls CBS, or that the Eugene Meyer family (Lazard Freres) controls Allied Chemical and the Washington Post, and Kuhn Loeb Co. the Wells Fargo Bank. He shows the New York Times interlocked with Morgan Guaranty Trust, American Express, First Boston Corporation and others, but does not show how the banking interlocks. He does not mention the Federal Reserve System in his entire book, which is conspicuous by its absence.</p>

<p>Bagdikian documents that the media monopoly is steadily closing down more newspapers and magazines. Washington D.C., with one paper, The Post, is unique among world capitols. London has eleven daily newspapers, Paris fourteen, Rome eighteen, Tokyo seventeen, and Moscow nine. He cites a study from the 1982 World Press Encyclopaedia that the United States is at the bottom of industrial nations in the number of daily newspapers sold per 1,000 population. Sweden leads the list with 572, the United States is at the bottom with 287. There is universal distrust of the media by Americans, because of their notorious monopoly and bias. The media unanimously urge higher taxes on working people, more government spending, a welfare state with totalitarian powers, close relations with Russia, and a rabid denunciation of anyone who opposes Communism. This is the program of &quot;the London Connection.&quot; It flaunts a maniacal racism, and has as its motto the dictum of its high priestess, Susan Sontag, that &quot;The white race is the cancer of history.&quot; Everyone should be against cancer. The media monopoly deals with its opponents in one of two ways; either frontal assault of libel which the average person cannot afford to litigate, or an iron curtain of silence, the standard treatment for any work which exposes its clandestine activities.</p>

<p>Although the Rothschild plan does not match any single political or economic movement since it was enunciated in 1773, vital parts of it can be discerned in all political revolution since that date. LaRouche* points out that the Round Tables sponsored Fabian Socialism in England, while backing the Nazi regime through a Round Table member in Germany, Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, and that they used the Nazi Government throughout World War II through Round Table member Admiral Canaris, while Allen Dulles ran a collaborating intelligence operation in Switzerland for the Allies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for the French side of things, it is extremely likely (and equally difficult to confirm/deny) that: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mayer, through Swiss brokers, financed the King&#39;s wars (with England, teehee), freemasonry, the cultural shift better known as &quot;Les Lumières&quot; (voltaire and all that horsecrap, most of which were masons), as well as disrupted the French economy (which was mostly about French people eating French food back then).</p></li>
<li><p>Louix XVI then refused to pay his debts to Mayer by giving up the central bank of France (only an English King would do that! well and Spanish, and Dutch, and... :P) </p></li>
<li><p>Mayer financed a North-African mercenary group to assist with the coup in Paris.</p></li>
<li><p>Mayer beheaded all the pseudo-democratic offsprings of the revolution that didn&#39;t end up providing him with his precious private central bank... this lasts 10 years...</p></li>
<li><p>Mayer got sick of waiting and ended up placing a young general from Corsica as dictator. Because a young general promoted dictator doesn&#39;t ask too much questions, it only took a few months for the private central bank &quot;Banque de France&quot; to see the day.</p></li>
<li><p>This private central bank then oriented its money creation towards expansion, and so the French army flipped Europe, err i mean, promoted democracy.</p></li>
<li><p>History was then written by the remaining parties.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Monarchies, and by extrapolation, dictatorships, are easily taken over and therefore do not constitute a viable alternative to the current mess.</p></li>
<li><p>Democracies are not democracies (at least not in Solon&#39;s true definition, but all the crap that comes after him sure, including Clisthene&#39;s democracy...), rather they are political designs aimed at occluding the real political power (in our case, central banks).</p></li>
<li><p>We need a cultural shift first for the incoming change to sink (probably going on, we wouldn&#39;t be here discussing these things otherwise).</p></li>
<li><p>We need a disrupting technology like Machiavelli&#39;s political theory and fiat money... something like the internet, bitcoins...</p></li>
<li><p>No need to throw crowds at institutions (and police/army forces), individuals can target key individuals, they just need to do so repeatedly until the wealth stops evening out the reality of suffering a young and violent death in the mind of the greedies.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p><em>A noted historian unpacks the Rothschild/Waterloo myth</em></p>

<p>As noted historian Niall Ferguson describes in his book The House of Rothschild, Part 1, Wellington&#39;s decisive victory at Waterloo was rather inconvenient, in financial terms, for the Rothschilds. </p>

<p>Ferguson dismisses - as fabricated - the tale repeated here, of Nathan Rothschild allegedly personally witnessing the victory at Waterloo and rushing back to London to engage in a frenzy of speculative stock market activity, as well as precipitating a market panic. </p>

<p>The truth is far more interesting. </p>

<p>Nathan  did not have <em>personally witness</em> Waterloo because the Rothschilds had their own speedy private messaging system; the messages themselves were written in a dialect which was an amalgam of Hebrew and German, with especially sensitive terms - referring to financial transfers -  protected by an additional layer of code words. </p>

<p>And, Nathan did indeed buy London Stock Exchange stock based upon his secret knowledge of the Waterloo victory, but that&#39;s not where the bulk of the consequent Rothschild profits came from according to Ferguson, who notes that the House of Rothschild came very close to collapse following Waterloo. </p>

<p>(see: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DJ_DJhdN1XQC&amp;amp;pg=PT48&amp;amp;dq=Rothschild,+Waterloo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=I50qVOvQBfbIsAS4m4CQBw&amp;amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Waterloo&amp;amp;f=false">http://books.google.com/books?id=DJ_DJhdN1XQC&amp;amp;pg=PT48&amp;amp;dq=Rothschild,+Waterloo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=I50qVOvQBfbIsAS4m4CQBw&amp;amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Waterloo&amp;amp;f=false</a> ) </p>

<p>Although an entire conspiracy mythos has arisen claiming the Rothschilds manipulated their early knowledge of Waterloo to make a financial killing, Ferguson observes, </p>

<p>&quot;the brothers [Rothschild] were encumbered [at the time of the victory at Waterloo] not only with substantial amounts of depreciating bullion, but also with over a million pounds&#39; worth of treasury bills to be sold in Amsterdam, to say nothing of a succession of half-finished subsidy contracts which would cease the moment a peace treaty was signed. As reports reached New Court confirming that the end of the war was immanent, Nathan [Rothschild] was faced not only with the immense profits of legend but with heavy and growing losses...&quot;</p>

<p>Ferguson goes on to describe the growing debacle for the Rothschilds, as the all-too quick victory threw a wrench into their hoped-for financial triumph. Nathan Rothschild did indeed buy British stock during the time that he had secret knowledge of the Waterloo victory but, Ferguson notes, even if Nathan made the maximum allowed purchase of stock allowed during that period, his subsequent profit &quot;would barely have exceeded&quot; 7,000 pounds.</p>

<p>The early victory provoked such chaos for the Rothschilds&#39; carefully laid plans to profit from the war that, as Ferguson describes, in the aftermath &quot;The trouble is that is almost impossible to say precisely how the Rothschilds performed financially in this period because they had no idea themselves. So tumultuous were the events precipitated by Napoleon&#39;s return from Elba, and so enormous the turnover of their various transfer operations during 1814 and 1815, that their already rudimentary accounting procedures collapsed altogether.&quot;</p>

<p>Ferguson goes on to detail the Rothschild brothers&#39; frantic attempts to locate apparently unavailable cash reserves necessary to meet their financial commitments. In the end, Ferguson concludes, the Rothschilds did pull victory from the looming catastrophe, but only through a frenzy of dubious, shady, and risky ad-hoc transactions: </p>

<p>&quot;It is fair to conclude that the huge profits of 1814 and 1815 were made in ways much more mysterious-and hazardous-than the traditional Waterloo myth implies.&quot;</p>

<p>In a sense, the Rothschilds failed forward. Like Waterloo itself, it was a touch-and-go victory that could have just as easily foundered upon small details. So much for the financial world masters of legend. They were running things more in the fashion of Enron prior to its collapse. And though the House of Rothschild did not collapse it was, for a period of time following Waterloo, quite touch and go. </p>

<p>But the conspiracy myth is so much sexier. Carry on. </p>
