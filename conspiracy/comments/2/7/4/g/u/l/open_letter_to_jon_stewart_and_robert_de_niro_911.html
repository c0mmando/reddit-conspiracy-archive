        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most people here are open to the suggestion that America was not attacked by Muslims on 9/11, if they do not already believe that. At the very least, the overwhelming majority of people here believe that Muslims should not be singularly blamed for the attacks, let alone Islam or &quot;the muslims&quot; for the actions of a small number of people. </p>

<p>The recently opened 9/11 WTC museum clashes with this perspective in a way that has been characterized as racist and islamophobic by a diverse array of people, from the museum&#39;s own interfaith advisory council to activist groups like jews against islamophobia.</p>

<p>One exhibit at the museum, a film called &quot;the rise of al-qaeda&quot; has drawn criticism in particular, especially due to the involvement of board member Debra Burlingame, who has  repeatedly and publicly expressed racist and islamophobic sentiments amounting to what many consider to be hate speech.</p>

<p>In response to a petition calling for her removal from the board in light of her statements, the board has instead chosen to double down and defend her. Burlingame is the go-to 9/11 family member for the far right, and has been an instrumental force in backing up the official story and defending the recently opened museum from criticism.</p>

<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/z3f9rNQX">This</a> is a brief open letter to Jon Stewart and Robert De Niro regarding the museum and this criticism. Stewart and De Niro are both board members of the museum, and will be having a discussion on the next episode of the daily show.</p>

<p>Please <strong>call</strong> Steve Albani (212-767-8695) and <strong>ask for the segment to address the museum, Debra Burlingame&#39;s comments, and her role in approving content at the museum.</strong> </p>

<p>As David Ray Griffin concludes in a short essay titled <a href="http://davidraygriffin.com/articles/was-america-attacked-by-muslims-on-911/">&quot;Was America Attacked by Muslims on 9/11?&quot;</a>:</p>

<p>All the proffered evidence that America was attacked by Muslims on 9/11, when subjected to critical scrutiny, appears to have been fabricated. If that is determined indeed to be the case, the implications would be enormous. Discovering and prosecuting the true perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks would obviously be important. <strong>The most immediate consequence, however, should be to reverse those attitudes and policies that have been based on the assumption that America was attacked by Muslims on 9/11.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what to make of this, in stating that muslims were not behind 9/11 are you challenging the standard narrative involving Al Quaida and a few handfuls of hijackers.  Or are you taking issue with the posing of extreme Islamic beliefs as an essential element of their motive?</p>

<p>This narrative as I&#39;ve seen it before seems to be a politically correct message in which some people are trying to disassociate the actions of the 9/11 hijackers, financiers, and planners from their ideological foundation in extremist Islam.  Although the linked article has a much more conspiratorial and &#39;truther&#39; aspects to it, which I&#39;ve not seen before, but is interesting. </p>

<p>Saying that some of the hijackers were not muslim enough seems to me to be a pretty lame attempt at this disassociation.  It is blatantly clear in the messaging of Al Quaida that religion is at the center of the motives for 9/11.  The two most salient qualms Al Quaida had for the attacks were 1) US support for Israel.  2) US troops in Mecca. </p>

<p>I have zero interest in trying to rewrite history or to paint a certain picture of the hijackers in order to placate people&#39;s delicate sensitivities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is Bin Laden&#39;s &#39;letter to America&#39; where he outlines his motivations behind 9/11 (allegedly). <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver</a> </p>

<p>Some quotes</p>

<p>&quot;As for the first question: Why are we fighting and opposing you? The answer is very simple:</p>

<p>(1) Because you attacked us and continue to attack us.</p>

<p>a) You attacked us in Palestine...</p>

<p>(b) You attacked us in Somalia; you supported the Russian atrocities against us in Chechnya, the Indian oppression against us in Kashmir, and the Jewish aggression against us in Lebanon.</p>

<p>(c) Under your supervision, consent and orders, the governments of our countries which act as your agents, attack us on a daily basis...</p>

<p>(d) You steal our wealth and oil at paltry prices because of you international influence and military threats. This theft is indeed the biggest theft ever witnessed by mankind in the history of the world.</p>

<p>(e) Your forces occupy our countries; you spread your military bases throughout them; you corrupt our lands, and you besiege our sanctities, to protect the security of the Jews and to ensure the continuity of your pillage of our treasures.</p>

<p>(f) You have starved the Muslims of Iraq, where children die every day. It is a wonder that more than 1.5 million Iraqi children have died as a result of your sanctions, and you did not show concern. Yet when 3000 of your people died, the entire world rises and has not yet sat down.</p>

<p>(g) You have supported the Jews in their idea that Jerusalem is their eternal capital, and agreed to move your embassy there. With your help and under your protection, the Israelis are planning to destroy the Al-Aqsa mosque. Under the protection of your weapons, Sharon entered the Al-Aqsa mosque, to pollute it as a preparation to capture and destroy it. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;(b) The American people are the ones who pay the taxes which fund the planes that bomb us in Afghanistan, the tanks that strike and destroy our homes in Palestine, the armies which occupy our lands in the Arabian Gulf, and the fleets which ensure the blockade of Iraq. These tax dollars are given to Israel for it to continue to attack us and penetrate our lands. So the American people are the ones who fund the attacks against us, and they are the ones who oversee the expenditure of these monies in the way they wish, through their elected candidates.</p>

<p>(c) Also the American army is part of the American people. It is this very same people who are shamelessly helping the Jews fight against us.</p>

<p>(d) The American people are the ones who employ both their men and their women in the American Forces which attack us. &quot;</p>

<p>Religion is clearly a part of it (or a justification), but it seems to me these are mostly political differences. They view themselves as defending muslims from the United States (assuming you believe Bin Laden was behind 9/11 and this document is authentic).</p>

<p>&quot;I have zero interest in trying to rewrite history or to paint a certain picture of the hijackers in order to placate people&#39;s delicate sensitivities.&quot;</p>

<p>Interesting, because I think that&#39;s exactly what people do when they blame it on &#39;radical Islam&#39; and ignore the fact that 9/11 was blowback for decades of imperialist US foreign policy and war crimes against muslim countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, the linked article was supposedly from Bin Laden, who was obviously a major part of Al Quaida&#39;s messaging and ideological foundation.  I was not referencing anything specifically but more the historical basis for the antipathy towards the US by Al Quaida, going back to the late 80s and early 90s. </p>

<p>I think it is fairly obvious that Islam and radical Islam acts as a tool through which strong men, dictators, and others who pursue power of all different types assert themselves.  It is however a real part of their ideology, insincere as it may be at times. </p>

<p>Pretending that Islam is not an essential part of this dynamic is simply misunderstanding the situation, as it is if we are to pretend it is the only element at work. </p>

<p>However, many of the arguments in his 2002 letter to America are similar to the Fatwa he issued against the United States in 1998 <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/530420/posts">http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/530420/posts</a></p>

<p>By the way, none of this precludes the possibility that Bin Laden was acting on behalf of, or working with, another organization or organizations</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We could have a discussion about the extent and nature of al-qaeda&#39;s involvement in 9/11 if you want, but that&#39;s not really why I wanted to create this thread. That discussion happens all the time in this subreddit (thankfully), it&#39;s even the top link in the sidebar right now...</p>

<p>What you&#39;re calling &quot;dissociation&quot; in some ways gets to the crux of the problem, the way discourses about &quot;extremist Islam&quot; come to frame people&#39;s political grievances and opposition to things like the US&#39;s support for Israel and US troops in Mecca in relation to a particular story about &quot;9/11&quot; and what happened on 9/11/2001.</p>

<p>In the past these discourses have enabled tremendous violence, such as the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 9/11/2001 there have been many hate crimes committed against Muslims and people who are not even Muslim, such as Sikhs, because of the &quot;picture of the hijackers&quot; people have in their minds.</p>

<p>&quot;The rise of al-qaeda&quot; is not only historically inaccurate (for instance, in does not adequately tackle the issue of the CIA&#39;s relationship with al-qaeda), it also reinforces racist imagery which will perpetuate this kind of violence if we do nothing to fight for change.</p>
