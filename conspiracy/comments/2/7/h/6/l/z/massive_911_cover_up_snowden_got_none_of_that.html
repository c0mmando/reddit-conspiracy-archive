<p>I didn&#39;t say that. It wouldn&#39;t require nearly as many people.</p>

<p>And again there would be no reason to have official documents that showed it was an inside job. We&#39;ve already seen whistleblowers show us how the terrorists were given visas and how the intelligence was ignored. That&#39;s the closest we&#39;ll get to whistleblowing on 9/11.</p>

<p>THat&#39;s not how it works. You have to be approved to enter the country and the people who are in charge of approving these terrorist tried their best to not allow them entry. They were forced by their superiors to give the visas out.
I&#39;ll say it again, you need to do your reading. Google visas for terrorist and get reading because you are seriously mistaken in your representation of how this process works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but to then claim thats proof they were &#39;in on it&#39; is laughable.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t make that claim. I&#39;m presenting various data points that build a picture of what may have happened. No single point means enough on its own to be considered proof.</p>

<p>And this shows just how willing you are to engage in this debate honestly. You have apparently lumped me in with some group you have in your head and you are attacking their arguments. Since you&#39;re so familiar with fallacies I&#39;ll let you tell us which one that is.</p>

<p>Maybe so, but all the conspiracy people from anti-vaxxers to troofers to UFO believers all seem to suffer from the same exact logical fallacies, like the hyper competency fallacy, which is thinking the government knew everything beforehand because they are a perfect organization of perfect super human evil geniuses. Have you ever taken a close look at your politicians in the US? Most of them do not have an IQ even approaching 100, GwB was known to have an IQ of 87. Thats your evil mastermind behind 9/11?</p>

<p>lol</p>

<p>Regardless. you all believe things because some idiot who wanted youtube hits so he could get a free Ferrari made a fake video and made a bunch of now debunked claims. Basically you all believe nonsensical claims with little or no evidence, thats the real problem here. Your standards of evidence are the same as they would be for the average child.</p>

The two do not have anything to do with each other and it&#39;s unreasonable to think that they would.

<p>Get your shit together and understand your chosen topic before coming to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to attack it.

You either don&#39;t understand logical fallacies past the name of a couple or you do understand them and unironically abuse them in a lame ass attempt to troll. You&#39;ve made it clear that you don&#39;t understand Snowden&#39;s previous job description nor what security clearance means and that they have various levels/degrees. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you&#39;ve never actually read any of his leaks. If you have, I&#39;m having a hard time figuring out why you think he would have any info at all about 9/11 or any other conspiracy theory not dealing with surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m &#39;bout to get all serious and use boldface... look out! <strong>Snowden did, and continues to, leak NSA/surveillance/intelligence gathering info. Why are you trying to discredit legitimate information by polluting it with 9/11, UFOs and chemtrails?</strong>* </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbkQddEDPs0">FOX news actually covered this immediately after 9/11, then deleted the broadcast from their archives and never spoke of it again.</a></p>

<p>All of the Israeli nationals were deported under the purview of the head of the DoJ&#39;s Criminal Division, Michael Chertoff, a well known Zionist, and relative of Benjamin Chertoff, famous contributor to the long debunked Popular Mechanics hit piece on 9/11.</p>

<p>Other than pro-Israel diaspora? A few elements within the U.S. government who were okay with their attack. Most of them called &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vulcans">Vulcans</a>&quot;, a nickname given by Condoleeza Rice to describe the neoconservatives in the Bush admin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who planets all the bombs in WTC7 to make sure it got blown up on the same day?</p>

<p>Mossad, overseen by Kroll Associates, run by Zionist diaspora Jules Kroll, who had the contract to provide security for the WTC complex since the 1993 bombing. (Which was also an inside job.)</p>

<p>Mostly, yes.</p>

<p>People get confused because Larry Silverstein was talking about the NYFD when used the &quot;pull it&quot; language. The FDNY does not have the capability to demolish a building like that, especially on such short notice. In fact, there are many videos of firefighters describing the bombs in the buildings.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument, the effort needed to fly planes into three buildings is much simpler than creating an atomic bomb. It would involve daily correspondence, sign offs on papers, taking small documents around the office. Mundane daily things as opposed to hiring 100,000 people and building a city in the middle of the desert. The people doing these things probably don&#39;t even remember because it was such a usual,daily thing for them to do in our bureaucratic government. </p>
