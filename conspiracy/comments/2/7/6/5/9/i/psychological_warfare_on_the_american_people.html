       I believe what you're referring to is 'Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars', a technical manual of sorts allegedly leaked from the first Bilderberg Group meeting in 1954:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The strategy of tension (Italian: strategia della tensione) is a tactic that aims to divide, manipulate, and control public opinion using fear, propaganda, disinformation, psychological warfare, agents provocateurs, and false flag terrorist actions.[1]
       </p>
       <p>
        The theory began with [revelations] that the United States government and the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 supported far-right terrorist groups in Italy and Turkey, where communism was growing in popularity, to spread panic among the population who would in turn demand stronger and more dictatorial governments.

       Propaganda eventually produces cognitive dissonance and psychosis. Distinct 'disconnects' with certain facts about reality. The mind 'compensates' around these, usually with simple denial, then hostility.  Its effect creates a person who will intentionally avoid questioning authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Propaganda controls the population. -We learned a lot about it during WW2, the Germans evolved the principles, us more-so.

       No real need to panic until they start trying to de-arm the populace. Which apparently is a big issue next year..

       How do you find propaganda? Watch your politicians commit treason and then observe what they say. That's their propaganda.   Wonder why they want to fund CDC for 'gun studies? (Which have ALREADY been done, ad nauseum)? -&gt; So they can 're-write' the 'facts'.. Which they've proven to be unashamed regarding outright lying about.

       The precedent was already set long ago by the CIA via Operation Mockingbird and MKULTRA and in relation, dosing unwitting parties with drugs such as Scopolamine and LSD.

       One method of mental incapacitation/nullification/alteration is the prescription of psychotropic drugs or so called therapies (electro-convulsive).

      <p>
       Institutionalization is another method.

       As a person who hasn't used LSD but is fascinated with the therapeutic use of psychedelics and psychonautics, it is a horrible monstrosity what has been done. To some, it was synthesized liquid lobotomy. To others, well.. Ted Kaczynski was experimented on extensively..

       oh yes its a wonderful thing if used in the right conditions, like going to the lake with some good friends, and i mean GOOD friends, the slightest word can fuck with you in a good or bad way depending the circumstances . Your innerself speaks to you in ways people can't imagine your subconscious can talk to you through your friends bodies which can really make you rethink your entire life, i could go on but there's so much to an LSD trip that you'd have to take it yourself to understand lol.

       While not stated as eloquently as it could have been, OP actually poses an interesting question.

       Why not consider the state of domestic propaganda in America, domestic psyops and tactics of psychological manipulation, infiltration and oppression used by the USG against its own people, in service of the TPTB.

       i like the way you think, it doesn't have to be so violent, what if the whole world or even half the U.S. spoke out against them? They can't get us all, all we can do is have a voice, we alone can make a difference like you said not everyone is so easily controlled but that sure as hell wont stop the "business" of america from trying to stop us cause they don't want to lose what they've accomplished.

       ah yes the cut off the food tactic, then they put up all this starving people in other countries donate money, when its really for them in my opinion, when in fact they could end it all with just the snap of a finger. If I were to suggest a movie to watch for everyone in this comment selection it would have to be Killing Them Softly look it up.

       i agree, when i have a child, actually before i get into that, i almost don't want to have a child because of fear of what they'll go through in this day of age, but i need to remember to be vigilant, for when i have a child i will prepare them for the path ahead not tell them what path they have to choose, i also understand about the TV, i was merely suggesting this movie because it tells of how the united states isn't the united states anymore its just a business, and the movie is all about psychological game play against one another.

       i see you are lol, and my parents are kind of the same way, they really wanted me to go to the military, but it was against all who i was so i saved up money to go to college to become what i've always wanted to be, which is a mechanic/customs auto shop, i could never go into the military because well i don't really know how to explain this, i don't like killing, and i don't like the way they teach our military from what i've heard they break you down and build you into the soldier that they want, but i also get that they don't completely get rid of you, there will always be apart of you left, i don't know i didn't go into it so i can't say what i'm saying is true. My parents always tried telling me that they're always right, well at least my mother did, my father is kind of a wuss when it comes to having his own opinions because if he did it would end up in a huge argument that i sure knew i didn't want to hear.

       sounds like you've had a full life :), haha the old i can hear the problems with cars i have that same ability, and about the boss lying thing its really the reason i want to become my own boss and start a customs shop/ arcade/chillspot, well because i know it would be good business for the area and sometimes you can't rely on anyone but yourself, especially when it comes to income, but only because income has been what this society has kind of been based on and who else better than yourself for to make up your own life right?

       I'm so glad that all these comments haven't been bad and we've been communicating, unlike the first few comments, i can't explain how glad it makes me to know and experience that there are in fact really good people out there. It takes me away from all the negativity.

       yeah i just wanted to know what peoples opinion were on this subject because i think its an important matter, when most people think problems are physical per say, its really hard for most people to see whats really going on, because most are only looking at the small picture and not the whole thing or the big picture.

       Isn't it funny? The psychology of humans? The way they've learned to manipulate people to do things without a struggle? But there's also a way for people to be as free as they want, that's why they put down laws or "rules" when in fact reality, nature has no rules ever go to was and people saying you have to wait a certain amount of time before one shoots the other? Hell no

       What people don't understand is that we shouldn't be fighting each other its as simple as that, its not about women's equality, gay rights, race rights, its about the rights of people in general, the right to have our own personal freedom.

       You sound like you have a great kid, and yeah one of my biggest pet peeves would have to be the school system also, especially from my experience, the idea for paying for knowledge when its everywhere, even in the air, its a ridiculous idea really in my opinion, think about it how did people learn from back in the stone ages? They learned through experience or with help with someone, not oh to learn this you need this many stones to trade for this knowledge.

       I feel you, i'd be the same way, but i hope my kid doesn't have ADHD because going through school made that difficult very difficult, because what society has made it, but my child will have to find out, because i have ADHD and they will more than likely get it from me, its a blessing and a curse at the same time depends on how you look at it.

       Speaking of ADHD, i'll never put my kid on that ADHD medication, my parents tried to force it on me and it wasn't too enjoyable, wasnt able to really think, more zombie like than anything, its just not something i want to give my kids, especially its basically perscribed amphetamine, or type of speed depending on which one you take, and i don't want my kid perscribed amphetamine.

       It's been going on for a long time, especially in the context of wars/who we're supposed to hate. McCarthyism had people convinced everyone was a Communist; terrorism is much the same in that we're supposed to be vigilant against 'terrorists'. Imminent peril, that's the name of the game. We're constantly under some threat: Rogue comets, terrorism from the evil scary Arabs, Lone-wolf terrorism, global warming, (and in the 70s, global cooling/a new ice age!), "Mass shootings"/stabbings/other kinds of violence, issues that seem relevant but only serve divisiveness (that's a huge one and it works damn well), and anything else they can dream up to scare us with. Fear plays havoc on the populace, and it continues to do so, regardless of the outlandish nature of said fear. They cook up the scenario, and by and large we ingest it verbatim. And all made easier by the net. Shut it down? Horseshit. It's making that shit easier to feed to us. Why fix it if it ain't broke?

       They say freedom of choice is an illusion right? but only to some extent, they dont live by the "laws" they put down for the people of the nation therefore they have no limitations, but since there have been "mental walls" put up as i'll put it, people beleive that they cannot

       All you have to do if you're say, the people in power, is create a world in which each one of the citizens are in danger, protected by the leaders, who are barely able to keep the citizens safe.. it's a dramatic sort of thing they're doing, but the reasons they give for 'protecting' us are so flimsy and B-Movie, yet it is repeated as true over and over and so it is eventually ingested as truth. Nowadays, any ridiculousness can be passed off as a 'threat' and nothing would be said as to the contrary. Unless of course you are a 'conspiracy theorist', or 'truther'. A good citizen never questions what his leadership conveys as true.

       I've quit television. It's really just advertising in different forms. I too love things, they just involve more reading and creative endeavours, like music. Those things are far more mentally conducive to positive mental states, at least in my experience.

       yes i love to listen to trance, its my favorite genere, i talk to my freinds experience life for what it is i can be in the room with my 2 other friends and not even talk and we just feel the good vibes of each other, we're so well connected to each other that sometimes words aren't even needed, which reminds me i took LSD with my friend and had another friend in the room who didnt take it, well the whole thing i thought me and my friend were talking, but according to my friend not tripping we were sitting there not moving our mouths, but we heard a conversation going on between the both of us even after the affects wore off, to my knowledge i can only assume that we somehow telepathically talked to eachother

       I like some trance; If I'm getting into electronica it's deep house for me (David Morales is still my favorite DJ) or if I want chill I go for Air or Zero 7. As to hallucinogens, I'd say this: Be careful with these types of things. In this day and age, what with perceptions being so twisted and bent, it's easy to let oneself go into places otherwise left alone. Many moons ago during my college career, we imbibed in fungus and could feel a conversation, if that makes sense. Those things are fun but in moderation. That's not to say that if the perfect chance came to me I would reject it, but these things should be seen as a rare treat and not a regimented consumption.

       oh yes its a wonderful thing if used in the right conditions, like going to the lake with some good friends, and i mean GOOD friends, the slightest word can fuck with you in a good or bad way depending the circumstances . Your innerself speaks to you in ways people can't imagine your subconscious can talk to you through your friends bodies which can really make you rethink your entire life, i could go on but there's so much to an LSD trip that you'd have to take it yourself to understand lol.
