    <div class="md"><p>I believe what you&#39;re referring to is &#39;Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars&#39;, a technical manual of sorts allegedly leaked from the first Bilderberg Group meeting in 1954:</p>

<p>It was made famous by none of other Milton William Cooper (author of <a href="http://wikispooks.com/w/images/b/bc/Behold_a_Pale_Horse.pdf">Behold A Pale Horse</a>), a former Naval intelligence officer turned conspiracy author and whistleblower who had predicted 9/11 (in June, 2001), and was subsequently gunned down on his own property later that year after being ambushed by local deputies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The strategy of tension (Italian: strategia della tensione) is a tactic that aims to divide, manipulate, and control public opinion using fear, propaganda, disinformation, psychological warfare, agents provocateurs, and false flag terrorist actions.[1]</p>

<p>The theory began with [revelations] that the United States government and the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 supported far-right terrorist groups in Italy and Turkey, where communism was growing in popularity, to spread panic among the population who would in turn demand stronger and more dictatorial governments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Propaganda eventually produces cognitive dissonance and psychosis. Distinct &#39;disconnects&#39; with certain facts about reality. The mind &#39;compensates&#39; around these, usually with simple denial, then hostility.  Its effect creates a person who will intentionally avoid questioning authority.</p>

<p>Propaganda controls the population. -We learned a lot about it during WW2, the Germans evolved the principles, us more-so. </p>

<p>Add information era  + near complete media control = today. </p>

<p>Stasi wet dream. </p>

<p>No real need to panic until they start trying to de-arm the populace. Which apparently is a big issue next year..</p>

<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/04/09/Obama-Requests-1-1-Billion-DOJ-382-1-Million-For-Gun-Control">http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/04/09/Obama-Requests-1-1-Billion-DOJ-382-1-Million-For-Gun-Control</a></p>

<p>Sounds legal, except for..</p>

<p>A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.</p>

<p>How do you find propaganda? Watch your politicians commit treason and then observe what they say. That&#39;s their propaganda.   Wonder why they want to fund CDC for &#39;gun studies? (Which have ALREADY been done, ad nauseum)? -&gt; So they can &#39;re-write&#39; the &#39;facts&#39;.. Which they&#39;ve proven to be unashamed regarding outright lying about. </p>

My parents always tried telling me that they&#39;re always right, well at least my mother did, my father is kind of a wuss when it comes to having his own opinions because if he did it would end up in a huge argument that i sure knew i didn&#39;t want to hear.</p>

Imminent peril, that&#39;s the name of the game. We&#39;re constantly under some threat: Rogue comets, terrorism from the evil scary Arabs, Lone-wolf terrorism, global warming, (and in the 70s, global cooling/a new ice age!), &quot;Mass shootings&quot;/stabbings/other kinds of violence, issues that seem relevant but only serve divisiveness (that&#39;s a huge one and it works damn well), and anything else they can dream up to scare us with. Fear plays havoc on the populace, and it continues to do so, regardless of the outlandish nature of said fear. They cook up the scenario, and by and large we ingest it verbatim. And all made easier by the net. Shut it down? Horseshit. It&#39;s making that shit easier to feed to us. Why fix it if it ain&#39;t broke?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you have to do if you&#39;re say, the people in power, is create a world in which each one of the citizens are in danger, protected by the leaders, who are barely able to keep the citizens safe.. it&#39;s a dramatic sort of thing they&#39;re doing, but the reasons they give for &#39;protecting&#39; us are so flimsy and B-Movie, yet it is repeated as true over and over and so it is eventually ingested as truth. Nowadays, any ridiculousness can be passed off as a &#39;threat&#39; and nothing would be said as to the contrary. Unless of course you are a &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39;, or &#39;truther&#39;. A good citizen never questions what his leadership conveys as true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve quit television. It&#39;s really just advertising in different forms. I too love things, they just involve more reading and creative endeavours, like music. Those things are far more mentally conducive to positive mental states, at least in my experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes i love to listen to trance, its my favorite genere, i talk to my freinds experience life for what it is i can be in the room with my 2 other friends and not even talk and we just feel the good vibes of each other, we&#39;re so well connected to each other that sometimes words aren&#39;t even needed, which reminds me i took LSD with my friend and had another friend in the room who didnt take it, well the whole thing i thought me and my friend were talking, but according to my friend not tripping we were sitting there not moving our mouths, but we heard a conversation going on between the both of us even after the affects wore off, to my knowledge i can only assume that we somehow telepathically talked to eachother</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like some trance; If I&#39;m getting into electronica it&#39;s deep house for me (David Morales is still my favorite DJ) or if I want chill I go for Air or Zero 7. As to hallucinogens, I&#39;d say this: Be careful with these types of things. In this day and age, what with perceptions being so twisted and bent, it&#39;s easy to let oneself go into places otherwise left alone. Many moons ago during my college career, we imbibed in fungus and could feel a conversation, if that makes sense. Those things are fun but in moderation. That&#39;s not to say that if the perfect chance came to me I would reject it, but these things should be seen as a rare treat and not a regimented consumption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh yes its a wonderful thing if used in the right conditions, like going to the lake with some good friends, and i mean GOOD friends, the slightest word can fuck with you in a good or bad way depending the circumstances . Your innerself speaks to you in ways people can&#39;t imagine your subconscious can talk to you through your friends bodies which can really make you rethink your entire life, i could go on but there&#39;s so much to an LSD trip that you&#39;d have to take it yourself to understand lol.</p>
