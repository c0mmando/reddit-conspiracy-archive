       Although hemp and marijuana are two different plants who are simply from the same genus, cannabis. Hemp doesn't produce the THC that pot does.

       When they went about their rounds of demonizing and illegalizing weed in the 1930's, industrial hemp got thrown in with the bunch. And that is how we lost that very potentially useful crop.

       I don't think hemp is such a wonder-crop as some people claim.  It's grown in other countries, and it hasn't been wildly successful in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But USA should legalize growing hemp anyway.

       Hemp IS the cannabis plant. It is exactly the same. Hemp plants do contain thc. However, the products created with hemp do not. The fibers in parts of the plant dont contain the thc (at least not in any appreciable amount.)
      </p>
      <p>
       For industrial use, im sure theyve used husbandry to create a subspecies of the marijuana plant that contains very little thc, even in the leaves and buds, to achieve this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right, though, that the plants they use for industrial hemp is a subspecies of the type that contains large amounts of thc. Maybe not scientifically labelled as a subspecies, but its kind of the same thing with dogs. German shephards are dogs, and so are poodles. They are all the same species. But, they are different breeds, created through animal husbandry.

       Horseshit, there's a physical withdrawal and also it's physically damaging to the brain, nerves, endocrine system and reproductive organs. Took me 15+ years to really understand what I really did to myself. Weed is NOT harmless, even if just eaten. Americans need to learn how to relax without substances, or y'know, stop the entitlement that minimal effort deserves "relaxation". Get a hobby!

       lol there is no physical withdrawal like heroin and meth, you have no claims to show it damages any of those systems. Don't make wild claims no one said it was harmless but it certainly doesn't segway the onset of any of these problems any more then alcohol or nicotine

       I saw tons of people addicted. And my ass had "zero" withdrawal from tobacco. Does that mean it's not addictive? You can't generalize it just from your personal experience.

       Its not physically addictive. You can smoke/eat/whatever however much you want for a looong time and then quit cold turkey and you wont get withdrawals like you would from benzodiazepines, cocaine, barbituates, or narcotics. What i meam is, you wont die or even get sick from withdrawals. There have been reports, though, of very very mild withdrawals after exceptionally exccessive long time use. Though, the withdrawals were less severe than a hangover from a good binge on alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana is, however, physchologically addictive. Meaning, for people who are prone to addiction, they may feel that they "need" to toke in order to sleep, and if they dont, then they claim they cannot sleep. Though, this is a psychosomatic issue, not a chemical issue. And of course, when discussing psychosomatics, you have to realize each person is different and will react differently than others.

       My guess is people who get addicted to pot aren't able to make the enough of the chemicals that pot gives you like serotonin. So it's very addictive to some people and has no affect on others.

       Well, it does turn out that the facts are aligned with phatlip12s comment. Cannabinoids do not directly affect 5-ht receptors and they do not directly affect serotonin reuptake as many antipsychotic prescriptions do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does, however, affect dopamine levels, but more as a result of receiving something pleasurable (like sex or chocolate) than a complete dopamine dump like other drugs (i.e. cocaine) do.

       Somethings wrong with your first link, or i dont have permission to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the second link, that article was talking about co-administering THC and MDMA (ecstacy). They wanted to see what co-administering thc with mdma would do for they hyperthermic symptoms of mdma. They found that the thc helped attenuate the decrease of 5-ht levels caused by mdma. That does not support the argument that marijuana directly affects serotonin levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, your third link didnt help much, other than an answer to some academic material or worksheet that says marijuana increases serotonin levels. But, anyone could just write that up. However, i gave you tue benefit of the doubt and decided i should dig a little deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found several articles (some on university websites) that said very low doses of marijuana do indeed increase marijuana levels. But, once you start taking more, the marijuana actually decreases your serotonin levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it looks like marijuana does both increase and decrease serotonin levels in our brains. It increases in low doses, decreases in higher doses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, to your original point...
      </p>

      <p>
       ...where you claimed marijuana "gives you" serotonin. The people who are alledgedly addicted to pot, as per your theory, need to have been taking many doses repeatedly and over a long time span, which the available sources indicate would mean the marijuana should be decreasing the serotonin levels on a perpetual cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like your theory, and i feel that in many ways it holds water. I just dont like this part because it seems to erroneously equates addiction to affects on serotonin levels.

       I apologize if the subject matter seems intimidating to you. Ill try to keep it on the high school level, as you have seemed to overlook the fact that i mentioned liking your idea. Anyhow...
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true that depression is a factor of addiction, it is psychological addiction, not physical.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with everything, there is good and bad all tied up together. Alcohol, for instance, causes painful hangovers, destroys the liver (from chronic abuse), and has killed hundreds of thousands of people due to overdoses. Alcohol also causes depression in alcoholics.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has ever died, ever, from a marijuana overdose, in the several thousands of years humans have been using it. And, while there are reports of marijuana causing depression in some individuals, it is not clear whether those individuals had preexisting psychological issues. Marijuana does tend to increase the risk of psychological issues in individuals who are already genetically prone to those issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        why celebrate it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because it is safer than alcohol and tobacco, which are both legal and bith are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key word is safer. It is not safe like how its safe to eat celery. There are obvious health concerns with marijuana. But, to prohibit it due to those health concerns, which are greatly overshadowed by the health concerns of alcohol and tobacco, it seems very hypocritical to ban marijuana.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a substance to be schedule one controlled, it needs to he highly dangerous (which marijuana has been proven not to be, it is actually less dangerous than alcohol or tobacco) it must be highly addictive (which marijuana has been proven not to be, despite a few reports of mild psychological dependence in addiction prone individuals) and have no medical value (which marijuana has been proven to be very useful in the treatment of autoimmune disorders like irritable bowl syndrome, chrohns, it is useful for cancer treatments in regards to pain management, and has helped those with chronic illnesses battle depression despite the reports that indicate that it could also cause or facilitate depression in psychologically prone individuals).
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that it is not made illegal for reasons that parallel the paramers set by the controlled substance act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, going back to OPs original topic, the only logical assumption is that marijuana is banned for other reasons. I tend to believe it is because of money, profits, and control. There is even a spiritual element in there, but i dont think it would be appropriate to discuss that much with you.

       If you were interested in learning then you wouldnt shrug off what someone is trying to explain to you(which is a different view than the one you subscribe to.) Instead, you let all the information go beyond you and you focus on what you perceive as an attempt to mislead since you cant seem to back up any of your claims with anything substantial. You just resort to attempting to discredit me through bogus "you offended me" comments.

       Your physiology is not special. Sugar and caffeine are biologically addictive. This means once you stop consuming these substances after using them on a regular/consistent basis the body will actually go through a withdraw period. The body will be sluggish, blood sugar levels will be in flux, and some of the normal body functions might be delayed (bowel movements etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       People regularly consume sugar/caffeine and in doing so the body becomes accustomed to the exposure. A morning cup of coffee will stimulate the liver and trigger a bowel movement. If you suddenly stop drinking coffee, your morning elimination would certainly be impacted by the change ;)

       Sorry. Receiving pleasurable feelings from serotonin is aligned with the facts of the affects of marijuana.
