<p>As I grow in my knowledge, the worse I see people. Even you or others here, how many still support government (e.g. vote, pay taxes)? If people are truly awaking up, then why isn&#39;t there more anarchy and opposition to government rule? Quite frankly, if someone is critically thinking, then they must reject government, otherwise I would say they have a flaw in their logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I reject some forms of government and its intrinsic failures, but you are misguided if you believe we need more anarchy and opposition to the government. A revolution would only be of any merits if you make sure that you receive what you wanted after said revolution ends. But how will you ensure that if you do not have any power right now (military force, financial power, strong political networks, network of corruption, influence, big media corporations, strategic oversight, etc.) and there is only a limited chance to have such power afterwards? This sounds only appealing to the ones who believe in plain force and feel strong enough to fight the fight. But have you also considered that the society consists of a great number of people who need protection, who would be the first to suffer from anarchy (elderly, handicapped, young people). If you have an elderly mother, several children a wife then you will be constantly concerned about their safety and search for measures to protect them and that will hinder your efforts to lead a political revolution. </p>

<p>On the other hand we know already the government is dependent on big money, has its puppet masters and that those are the ones that should be attacked in the first place. And if you really oppose them then you should hurt them financially as long it is legal and you make sure they lose their financial strength, because they are dependent on the cash flow to protect their corrupt system. And there I see a lot of inconsistency, but also a lot of potential. You do not buy their products, you do not pay for their entertainment, you oppose every legislation that only helps them, you do not work for them, you boycott them and you convince other people to avoid making business with them. You do that your whole life, every day and not only when you are political awake and motivated  in your 20s to 30s and then perhaps you will have an impact. It will not be a fast transition but a long-lasting one if it is done properly.</p>

<p>Why is Monsanto still operating? Why are bankers still generating profits? Why are we still buying cheap china junk? Why is everybody obsessed with sports and celebrities? Why are so much people faking it and wishing they would earn much more money they have right now? Why is our food unhealthy?</p>

<p>The reason evil corporations are still existing is not only corruption, no moral restrictions and tactical strength, but also the simple reason that we, the society, are constantly helping them instead of giving our resources to other alternatives. You will only succeed  and convince people if you make it appealing for them to break through group thinking and not be led by commercials and PR. But how will you appeal to the masses if the only thing they are accustomed to is entertainment and to fit their egoistic needs as fast as possible?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>OK, so your point is that without government, children and old people will suffer. I think the common sense question to be asked is that if I&#39;m witnessing my elderly mother, children and wife suffering, then why am I not doing anything about it? Are my arms and legs broken? What about these people themselves, are they so incapacitated to not be able to care for themselves either?</p>

<p>So your premise here is flawed, in that you&#39;re assuming that people start at a point of helplessness, then government rescues them. The fallacy here is in the fact that if people are helpless to begin with, then they couldn&#39;t create a government. If they have enough energy and resources to create government, then they should have had enough energy to care for themselves to begin with. After all, government is an extra burden on top of people, so it&#39;ll just make their lives worse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand we know already the government is dependent on big money, has its puppet masters and that those are the ones that should be attacked in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you&#39;re changing the argument. You&#39;re saying that certain people are big producers (i.e. big money). They produce enough for themselves and their elderly parents, children and wives...plus they have extra left over. You&#39;ve refuted your above premise that people wouldn&#39;t have enough. </p>

<p>Your claim is that some people have too much and others have too little. You&#39;re also implying that the over-producers are preventing the under-producers from caring for themselves somehow. You&#39;ve fallen for political rhetoric and not examined the issue for yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if you really oppose them then you should hurt them financially as long it is legal </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You stepped outside of the premise of anarchy. Remember nothing is illegal in an anarchy. This is what I mean about critical thinking. You&#39;re not being consistent in your views, they&#39;re all jumbled up. You know the goal you want to achieve, so you try to develop a narrative towards that goal about why you deserve it. </p>

<p>In the end, you&#39;re just looking for an excuse to take other peoples things. Well welcome to the world you desire, because thats what we have. The problem though is that people are taking your things and not the other way around. You have no room to complain that it&#39;s unfair, because it&#39;s what you wanted, only the tables got turned on you.</p>

<p>Yep, government.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t you just hate it when people &quot;help&quot; one another. Your solution is to take a gun and force people to stopping freely cooperating with one another and instead do what you tell them to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a friend of anarchy, because the concept is flawed and coming from Utopia, like communism was according to Marx himself. I consider myself open minded and have seen several forms of governments and read about the theory of a lot of them, because I like to think about a perfect government forms, but anarchy is not something that will ever work on a big scale. It is so impractical that it did not and never will exist anywhere. Some called it the rule of the jungle, but you go to a village of indigenous people in the jungle right now and you will find rules and socially accepted behaviour. That is the reason I was not referring to anarchy after that short sentences. Anarchy is not suppressed it simply does not happen in natural settings and every artificial form is hard to balance in order so it does not disintegrate. A lot of people need rules and are happy to follow them. That is in their DNA and you will not change it. How will you prevent them from having rules and impose them on you without you having rules? You can not, because they already did that to you and as long you are not living in the woods or inside a prison you followed them some million times. So do not tell me you would survive anarchy outside a theoretical setting. Did you ever even lived in an apartment-sharing community and proposed anarchy? Even a small number of humans can be unbearable when they do constantly things that you do not like and what you do not like gets dealt with. That is simple mathematics that this concept of non-ruling is not stable and fragile as the weakest participant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OK, so your point is that without government, children and old people will suffer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the time the government is not directly protecting my family with force. Government provides certain stability within predictable ranges and that stability and possibility to plan the future influences the way people within that government behave and the choices they have to make a living. You can criticise any government all day long and I am very happy to join, but all of them provide stability nevertheless and humans tend to rely on certain rules, because they provide stability. The moment rules are optional the ones without ethical restrictions but enough criminal energy, will have advantages over the ones who chose to be nice. By the way this is already happening in restricted places, but most of the time psychopaths do not succeed. Inside a government there are just certain psychopaths who are too big to fail and will never be prosecuted. Weak people will be defenceless in anarchy, they even will die and stronger people will mourn and ask for rules or impose their rules on others to control the others. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>then why am I not doing anything about it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply, because my family is free to go wherever they want and I am not always with them. You never had a baby and knew how fragile it is it seems. Your five year old daughter goes to the kindergarten and is crushed by someone who did not feel the need to keep a reasonable speed limit or some Satanist or lover of Luzifer and Aleister Crowley raped your child. Then your elderly mother got her purse stolen and during the robbery she hits her head on the ground and also died. By that time you realise that you better do not get ill or old or you will be fucked, if you are even allowed to survive that long. Or maybe you go mad and kill some thousand anarchy assholes that you happen to hate. Was that the way of living you imagined when you though of all the improvements and freedoms anarchy would provide? I bet you did not, because people tend to idealise and are keen to believe in fantasies as long as they wish they were true. It is wishful thinking. Be honest and ask yourself again “is anarchy really something this world can live in?”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve fallen for political rhetoric and not examined the issue for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me thinks you do not spend much time observing people from different walks of life. Anarchy is an illusion and a mindfuck. Let me rephrase mindfuck. There does not exist a group of animals or humans in this world at the moment that would be fit enough to experiment with anarchy longer than 20 years, so it will not materialise on real world level during our lifetime. Most of the experiments ended within a few months or at most a year after they started it. We had witnesses such short involuntarily experiments already after financial chaos or wars and it ended in a disaster for the ones involved and was stopped by immediate call for rules and protection. We as human kind are evil motherfucker and there are crazy ones who do need restrictions in a society, for the higher purpose of protecting the whole group. You have a group of five males that meet for the first time and they directly will assert their positions and some will try to be the alpha male, because that is what mammals do naturely. That alone will set already rules and the leader will impose more rules on the others. Some people are not alpha at all and need leaders and protection and they will need a safe haven, because the individual humans have very different characteristics and different skills. But power rules the world and physical force dominates the ones who will be enslaved. And the bigger the weapons the bigger the influence. You can not and will not change this by imaging fantasy worlds.</p>

<p>I could imagine quite a few Utopias, and several philosophers did, but I also believe that this is the best you can get. This world we are living in right now is the best you can get considering all different interest, the current population and human behaviour. And that is the reason we are living in such a world and not in anarchy. Face it and deal with it, because this world is really fucked, but you do not have much options to chose from. By reviewing every bit of it you can improve gradually and perhaps get to change even the human kind, but I strongly doubt that humans are socially prepared to have anarchy even in a million years from now. So do not waste your time in that idea. Every sense in your body knows already it is not possible, even if every human being would be exactly the same as you are. Your freedoms end where theirs begins and you can only posses what you take from this world and is not shared with others. But humans like belongings, they tend to be egoistic, they tend to be competitive, they tend to be ruthless and some will kill you when you have to be killed to help them to meet their desired objective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not advocating anarchy as the end-all, be-all, I just took issue with you saying that the current system is the best we can get.  Since the current system is set up (by design) to benefit the very, <em>very</em> few at the expense of the many, I completely disagree that it&#39;s the best we can get or hope for.  It&#39;s actually pretty close to the exact opposite, in my opinion, and getting closer by the day.</p>

<p>How will you prevent them from having rules and impose them on you without you having rules?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anarchy isn&#39;t a lack of rules (thats chaos). Rules can come from sources other than government. For example, we have rules on reddit and yet they are not reviewed or approved by government. Reddit is not government and it&#39;s not chaos, it&#39;s anarchy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can criticise any government all day long and I am very happy to join, but all of them provide stability nevertheless and humans tend to rely on certain rules, because they provide stability</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Government is also the source of the majority of problems in the world. Logically we need to eliminate government and apply rules through alternate means. win-win.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simply, because my family is free to go wherever they want and I am not always with them. You never had a baby and knew how fragile it is it seems. Your five year old daughter goes to the kindergarten and is crushed by someone who did not feel the need to keep a reasonable speed limit or some Satanist or lover of Luzifer and Aleister Crowley raped your child. Then your elderly mother got her purse stolen and during the robbery she hits her head on the ground and also died</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you believe that government is protecting these things from happen? If I gave you evidence that a 5 year old was killed by a speeding car or a elderly woman had her purse stolen, then would you accept that government fails at protecting from these just the same? After all, we have government and yet these things still occur. That refutes your claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Me thinks you do not spend much time observing people from different walks of life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is a discussion about critical thinking and not political ideology. if you believe you&#39;re a critical thinker, then perhaps the best test is to pick one topic (e.g. government protects 5 year olds from accidents) and lets explore that one area to see if you have &quot;critically&quot; thought about it fully. I&#39;ll let you pick the topic.</p>

<p>It is not anarchy, because there is a hirarchy. A state without government, but with rules is even more of a brainfuck, because there is no force present. If you have rules then you have to enforce them and then you get your republic again plus a government.</p>

<p>I never said accidents do not occur. I said governments provide stability and that is far from perfect. Every bad thing you can imagine can happen in every scenario and every system. But I do not think in absolutes since I know they are non existent. I rather think in probabilities. And if you ask me if it is more likely that people will speed if there are no boundaries that restricts them or nobody enforces the rules, then I will say it certainly is more probable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(e.g. government protects 5 year olds from accidents) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something I never said, but still an easy one to defend. Here are two real life examples on how obeying the rules saves peoples life in traffic. Germany has a lot of traffic a lot of cars, they have no speed limit at all on some autobahn, but Germans obey the rules, because policemen enforce them very strictly. And there is a rule for everything in Germany. 2008 they had 4477 and 2013 they had 3340 traffic deaths. India is the opposite. Traffic rules seem to be optional for them and even when they can not drive fast their way of driving kills a lot of people. They have the world record of traffic deaths. 118000 killed in 2008. Now you say, that they have a higher population. That is right, but even when there is not everywhere traffic in India and not everybody has a car there still much more accidents and deaths in India. It is still double the figure of Germany per capita and that is far too much for that kind of country.</p>

<p>Another example is Russia. They have a big country and their roads often have only two lanes. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeR8CemY24">One for each direction and they are not separated at all</a>. That country does not have big taxes so it does not have that big amount of money to have roads that are similar to the German Autobahn connecting the whole country point to point. The Germans have that nice Autobahn system all over the country that consist of <a href="http://www.myvideo.de/watch/2285894/1_0l_VW_Polo_2_mit_fast_180_Sachen_auf_der_Autobahn">three lanes for each direction and the directions are separated physically from each other</a>, so you can not enter the opposed lane by driving to the left. You will see very often accidents and dangerous situation on that rural roads in Russia, but not as much in Germany, because there dangerous situations do not present since you pass slower cars very safely. Russia has round about 28000 dead in traffic per year. And that is five times per capita as in Germany.</p>

<p>The government influences the rules, the design of the roads and enforces the laws so I am rather convinced that they can influence the conditions in traffic, so people are less likely to be killed. And less people killed means also less five year old killed.</p>

<p>Are you claiming that Russia is not a government? If I gave you a link to evidence proving that Russia does in fact have a government, would you accept that government doesn&#39;t save lives due to road deaths?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The government influences the rules, the design of the roads and enforces the laws so I am rather convinced that they can influence the conditions in traffic, so people are less likely to be killed. And less people killed means also less five year old killed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disney World in Florida has 100% private roads and a lot less people die than even what you mentioned for Germany. this alone should be evidence that if you&#39;re concerned about deaths, then roads are better in private hands than government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. But even us the people who question all are today a easy target. Many conspiracies are prefabricated and used as misinformation, a way of creating misleading conspiracy, intelligence companies use our own wish to question all to plant conspiracy theories that will in fact create further disinformation in a shape of actual information, given you the notion that you are questioning something and that you know something about it. But that was the goal, while we question the wrong questions,  opportunists use this factor to foment false belief of understanding.
We the people who spend time reading this info are more likely to be affected in our daily life. While the more happier people who moves a lot, who have social activities that are direct related to their true needs, and engage in a more daily interaction with people and nature are less likely to be any effected by mass propaganda, as they won&#39;t feel the need to further question it they will only spend their times living the life they want in a day to day pursue, and it is a more effective way to look for your true self. While conspiracy will only affect this persons  when it directly collide with their desires.</p>

<p>Skepticism is a rational approach to understanding of scientific claims and other claims such as conspiracy theories. Science makes claims which are provisional in nature, which means that is [they are] open to change.</p>

<p>There are millions of 9/11 truthers? I sincerely hope you are wrong, for that just implies that America&#39;s education system is failing harder than I thought it was. What I <em>can</em> say with the utmost in confidence is experts in relevant fields (engineering, demolition and to a lesser extent architecture) whole heartedly disagree with the 9/11 truther hypothesis of events. Even the A&amp;E for 9/11 truth guys invalidate themselves. They claim &quot;2,000 relevant experts support us&quot;. Go look at their singing list and count up all the architects, engineers and demolitions experts you find. Guess what? <em>less than half of those 2,000 signatures are from said experts</em>. Further, if we were to assume all 2,000 were engineers for example, which is not the case but I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt, that would mean less than 0.1% or something like that, of all engineers in America had signed.</p>

<p>A larger percentage of climate scientists think climate change is not man-made (roughly 3% based on current estimates). Yet, we have come to a provisional conclusion and a scientific consensus that Climate Change is real and basically we humans did that.</p>

<p>A &quot;good enough&quot; answer is not good enough. An answer should only be accepted if it is able to explain the questions you&#39;ve asked.

<p>There&#39;s no narrative. But people like to latch on to the idea that there is one &quot;truther&quot; story, so that it becomes much easier to throw overboard by sweeping statements like yours.
But you&#39;re right, so far, there are very few answers I&#39;ve <em>liked</em>. Because I&#39;ve spent so much time on this topic, I can see the distortion and omissions in the answers we have gotten. Again, there&#39;s nothing wrong with not liking an answer. Especially when the answers are coming from people who do nothing but lie.</p>

<p>Maybe not in your version of the US, and trust me, everyone knows what the state of journalism is in the US, but in most civilised countries, asking questions is in fact, the most intellectually honest thing to do. Unless of course, you&#39;re a strong supporter of secrecy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because you have this obsession of putting people in a group and labelling them truthers. You then formulate some fantasy story and sell it as their own. And you&#39;ve been doing it for so long, apparently, that you started believing in it.
So now you can honestly say to yourself, look, all these people that are in no real way connected all believe this outlandish theory I&#39;ve crafted, proving they are dumb. I see a few holes in that theory too, but I suppose you have all the answers to back this one up? </p>

<p>To answer your question, millions of people in the US do not believe the official story. After all the polls that have come out the last decade, I really wonder where your audacity to put this into question is coming from. If you feel like playing poker, you&#39;ve chosen the wrong opponent.
Perhaps I should also remind you that this is not a national, but a global thing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is no &quot;9/11 truther hypothesis of events.&quot; And using terms like &quot;truther&quot; or &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is just derogatory, meant to make those who read this shut off. I&#39;d like it if you stopped using them, because I find it very dishonest and childish.
With that being out of the way, I can say with the utmost confidence that experts in relevant fields have brought up many problems with both the narrative and the scientific explanation of the official story.</p>

<p>Waving our dicks around, claiming one is bigger than the other, will get us nowhere.</p>

<p>I find it rather odd that, in your defence, you tell me to go count the amount of experts in A&amp;E, rather than point out what exactly it is they&#39;ve done right or wrong. Now, before I let your lengthy paragraph lead me astray, let me ask you again, what gives you the power to decide what is right or wrong? Do we just believe whichever group has the biggest number?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a skeptic too. So lets quickly go through some of the bunk you just cited.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Its not a or &quot;<strong>the</strong> self proclaimed&quot; hub of skepticism. Its a community of intellectuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Some skeptics feel that certain conspiracy theories are soo outrageous, that they must be mocked and heckled into extinction. I can understand where these people are coming from (and guess what? <em>they&#39;re right</em>) but I like to think that someone who&#39;s hopped the crazy fence is capable of hopping back over. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been around this subreddit for 3 years.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no room for &quot;faith&quot; in the realm of science. <em>Most</em> skeptics actually have an understanding of science, many are experts in specific fields. Nobody has &quot;faith in established hierarchy&quot; either, whatever the fuck that is supposed to actually mean. Such a broadly encompassing term can be directed at any group or belief.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want internet circlejerk, look no further than <a href="/r/conspiracyv2">/r/conspiracyv2</a>. Its the same as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, <em>except that its a private subreddit of conspiracy circlejerking, immune from skeptical discourse of any kind whatsoever</em>. Where is the private skeptic communities? There are <em>none</em>. They are all public and open communities. Why are there soo many private conspiracy communities? Does this sound like open minded discourse to you?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since you went off on some broadly encompassing character attack, its time someone returns you the favor. Why do conspiracy theorists on youtube by and large moderate heavily their comments section, often disabling comment threads entirely for videos? Why don&#39;t skeptics do the same thing? Which one of these actions sounds like closed mindedness to you? Ah, look at that. I was still too polite to actually turn that into an attack of character. Funny enough, the visceral attacks tend to come from one side, the conspiracy theorists while the skeptics simply dismiss the attacks as irrelevant.</p>

<p>One final point. I&#39;m a skeptic and I love conspiracy theories. They are entertaining, great story material. Some of them could even be true. You want the people behind you on some conspiracy theory, you need to provide good evidence which proves your theory. Conjecture, hearsay and blanket claims are not good evidence. I think you will find that if you approach most skeptics they are a lot more open minded than any of the conspiracy regulars. They just want amazing evidence to match your amazing claims before they endorse them. Why is that soo wrong?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>military career types</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a military veteran post on JREF. Regardless, that&#39;s an invalid character attack and it doesn&#39;t make the skeptics at JREF any more right OR wrong in what they claim about anything. The evidence is what accounts for that. Your logical fallacy based character attacks do nothing to sway them.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me. I&#39;m too busy laughing my ass off at all of this and face palming to put together a rational response.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just leave you with this: Your set of invalidated beliefs is the reason why society doesn&#39;t believe in the shit that you say. Its not that they&#39;re sheep, its that you follow a closed movement of sheep. The conspiracy theorists are the sheep in reality, following various invalidated beliefs. This mindset is why nobody believes you guys.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calling yourself an intellectual doesn&#39;t make you one, it&#39;s simply smug and a hint that the opposite might be true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t call myself an intellectual. I am done with this conversation. Its laughable. I might as well argue the age of the earth with a fundamentalist christian. I might as well argue the safety of vaccines with someone who googled &quot;vaccine dangers&quot; and watched the first youtube video that popped up and now thinks they know better than I do. I might as well argue with a hipster anti-GMO activist who also did the same thing, seems to be concerned about everyones health yet chain smokes cigarettes.</p>

<p>If you want to, you know, have an actual intellectual conversation I&#39;m all ears. But if you want to go off on unsolicited diatribes and throw shit at people I will stand at the sidelines, facepalming and laughing. As will most of society.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know how science works. Go back to school. Open your mind (for real).</p>

<p>Edit: Okay. You wanted an example of a conspiracy theory mocked into extinction. I guess as a valid form of proof that mocking a bad idea like that will make it go away. I don&#39;t understand how thats a valid form of proof for something like that. Such a thing tends to work better on an individual basis. I for one am not for mocking conspiracy theories, but I <em>do understand those whom do that</em>. Anyway, to give an example of one that is talked about a lot less now because of the mockery? Sure. Ancient Aliens. Your move.</p>

Political preference mixed in with fear mongering, racism, gender, class etc causes so much division that they don&#39;t need to round anyone up. Like the recent Las Vegas shooting, the less intelligent read what the media writes and equates all those listed buzzwords in the articles as literally cop murderers or who are close to killing cops.

The Internet is the only way people can discuss things freely (other than in person discussions, which rarely happen).  We cannot allow corporations to censor the Internet by slowing down websites they don&#39;t like.  The plan to end net neutrality is most definitely a conspiracy to abolish freedom of speech on the Internet (while making a profit, of course).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Statistics bandied around triumphantly by the &quot;alternative media&quot; state pretty clearly that the &quot;mainstream media&quot; is dying from lack of viewer-ship. This much appears to be true. Now, if this is the actual case then there should be less reason to fear the effects of mainstream propaganda of the type we are seeing at the moment fomenting blame towards &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; etc after the Las Vegas shooting.</p>

<p>Further more, if these people who are turning off the mainstream media in droves are supposedly turning to the alternative media instead then it would stand to reason that a large chunk of the population is informed against the propaganda of the mainstream. 
Or are these people just paying no attention at all to any type of news media now, and the world is becoming heavily populated with masses of people who are completely uninformed about current events from any angle???</p>

<li>This has been attributed to Orwell on the internet, but the earliest source citing him as author appears to be a post from Jsnip4 on the RealistNews.net forum (14 February 2011). The statement seems to have actually originated in an opinion piece by columnist Selwyn Duke, &quot;Stopping Truth At The Border: Banning Michael Savage From Britain&quot; (6 May 2009)</li>
