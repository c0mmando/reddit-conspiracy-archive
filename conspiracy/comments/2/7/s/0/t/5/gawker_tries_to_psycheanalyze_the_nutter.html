<p>My Rebuttal:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Popeye">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Popeye</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Starting on March 20, 1967, and continuing through every rainy season (March to November) in Southeast Asia until 1972, <em>operational cloud seeding</em> missions were flown. Three C-130 Hercules aircraft and two F-4C Phantom aircraft based at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base Thailand flew two sorties per day. The aircraft were officially on weather reconnaissance missions and the aircraft crews as part of their normal duty generated weather report information. The crews, all from the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, were rotated into the operation on a regular basis from Guam. Inside the squadron, the rainmaking operations were code-named &quot;Motorpool&quot;.</p>

<p>UN bans hostile environmental modification: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Modification_Convention">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Modification_Convention</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Convention bans weather warfare, which is the use of weather modification techniques for the purposes of inducing damage or destruction. The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 would also ban some forms of weather modification or geoengineering</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People used to post links with patents on geoengineering tech from half a century ago that&#39;s more advanced than what&#39;s barely unacknowledged now.  Anybody have more links?  Why the hell do you think the UN banned weather modification as a weapon in the 1970s? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eastlund explained in his patent application that by influencing the ionosphere, methods of weather modification are possible. “Weather modification is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns or altering solar absorption patterns by constructing one or more plumes of atmospheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing device.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice find.  The real issue, IMO, is the stranglehold of the petrodollar.  The great irony is the biggest corporate patrons presumably supporting these aggressive climate policies, while opposing any competition against the petrodollar, are one in the same. Such a conundrum.  I suppose it&#39;s that paradox that I&#39;m opposing, because pollution is very real and an epic problem, whether you want to call it climate change, Dixie Chick queefing or something else.  The immediate and long term impacts on natural ecosystems, wildlife and peoples&#39; health must be confronted.  The denial, nevertheless, is annoying. </p>

<p>If the military, which caries a lot of clout in the US, openly said &quot;we&#39;re unilaterally combating pollution,&quot; the public would get behind it.  I don&#39;t understand all the secrecy other than it being a terrible habit of theirs, the sociological systemic imperative, unless there are less than noble intentions piggybacking.  Sure, they don&#39;t want mistakes to be exposed or their R&amp;D being under scrutiny, but this is such ridiculous cynicism unless they&#39;re terraforming for our reptilian overlords.  </p>

<p>Far more would be accomplished by engaging the full breadth of intellectual capital, as opposed to clandestine military discretion.  Or, they&#39;re worried about the side effects, in which case with peoples&#39; backs against the wall, in the clutch, people will rise to the occasion and develop necessary counter-measures, innovate new and unforeseen climate solutions, etc.  This secrecy fucks capitalism, innovation and human potentiality in the ass given any understanding of the art of war itself.  So unwise.  </p>

<p>Methods for how to win and combat political opponents should absolutely not be utilized against the scientific community and 21st Century society.  Be strong and do whats right, and meet roadblocks and consequences as they come, rather than being cynical deceitful fucking cowards tapping a narrow spectrum and field of talent for problems that effect us all.  Rather than engaging and interfacing with the entire population as if it was the buildup to Dday, only a fraction of what could and should be accomplished is even being attempted, much less unveiled by the clutch/crunch time and simple logic of a greater interfaced, interconnected and multi-spectrum social pool yielding near infinite possibilities relative to what&#39;s currently underway. </p>

<p>Think of the vastly greater number of scientists society could create if teenagers and young people, or even adults looking for new purpose, KNEW of what problems existed, and could identify the possible paths with enough time to truly pursue it.  Paths and causes of meaning that was incentivized by money, prestige of cause and meaningfulness.  If only those opportunities and possibilities, the access, was opened up then civilization&#39;s intellectual, social and industrial capital would skyrocket. </p>

<p>Or, maybe they have psychological models that predict the best current way to nurture this necessary cause is by creating an element of mystery and ubiquitous action that doesn&#39;t give a fuck about the politics.  Again, that would take me back to the suppressed tech by the petrodollar, and how alternative means of energy that could nip pollution problems at the bud are entirely suppressed for the status quo&#39;s monopoly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s a true connection as opposed to correlation, talk about hubris (certainly wouldn&#39;t surprise given their MO).  People who aren&#39;t adults, but rather get off on their little cutesy shit rather than meaningful relationships, intellectual virtue, family and society&#39;s progress.  With great power comes great?  Not cutesy shit.  Wisdom and virtue really need to make a comeback, and this generation of fucktards need to get out of our way.  </p>

<p>As a joke we should send related DoD/Congress/execs a packet of golf, fishing and camping vouchers.  Maybe make Abu Dhabi the resort of former fucktards, or rename it Fucktardom, a cordoned-off zone in which said officials are given a lifetime supply of vouchers in exchange for fucking off.  Meh, leave them some dignity and just give them the vouchers and Abu Dhabi can keep its name.  ;p</p>

<p>The modern nature of policy makers, military and related institutions <em>does not</em> incentivize the best and brightest to participate or work with them.  Far too despotic. </p>

Who/what puts the &#39;Chem&#39; in chemtrail?  Why do people only discuss the materials used (in reality just the Petr-dish).

I used to pay attention to the meteorological sites from the west coast that tracked cloud formation over the Pacific ocean, and the streaks of man-made cloud coverage were routine, personally I don&#39;t believe in coincidences enough to think Japan was an accident and natural event, having read that pdf and not being willing anymore to put anything past the likes of these people. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t disagree that the U.S. government (and all major governments) have researched weather modification.</p>

<p>After linking to Operation Popeye, I hope you didn&#39;t stretch a muscle acknowledging that.  Considering the intellectual think tanks behind military preparedness factor in Murphy&#39;s law, and with the existence of and works of Tesla over a century ago, it&#39;s a bygone conclusion.</p>

<p>The very first link is a clear example of chemtrail&#39;s existence in Operation Popeye by plane dispersal.  Historical fact and precedent, period.  Maybe you overlooked the very first point?  The rest is answering why, why would they do this?  What&#39;s the motive?  This link provided by BipolarsExperiment answers it clearly: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/27s0t5/gawker_tries_to_psycheanalyze_the_nutter/ci3xsa4">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/27s0t5/gawker_tries_to_psycheanalyze_the_nutter/ci3xsa4</a></p>

<p>The only &quot;strawman&quot; here is you turning HAARP into one, ironically.  The electromagnetic currents associated with HAARP-tech function in conjunction with cloud particulates, also displayed in one of the videos. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The operation seeded clouds with both <strong>silver iodide</strong> and <strong>lead iodide</strong>, resulting in the targeted areas seeing an extension of the monsoon period an average of 30 to 45 days. As the continuous rainfall slowed down the truck traffic, it was considered relatively successful.[1] However, resultant rain and subsequent flooding of the nearby Song Con River is sometimes blamed for the move of POWs from the prison camp at Son Tay and therefore, the failure of Operation Ivory Coast</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s from this, again: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Popeye">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Popeye</a></p>

<p>There have been youtube documentaries on what chemicals are in the particulates, but again, the wiki of Operation Popeye names some of them.  There was also a video of a govt. scientists briefing local California meteorologists on chemtrails and what chemicals makeup the particulates.  There were several questions as to the neurological and health impacts of the increase in those chemicals in water.  Naturally, that video is long gone. </p>

<p>Thank you, regardless, for your glib and sourceless strawman argument. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I asked my mom if I could stay at a friend&#39;s house and went to a high school party. Two hours in and I am drunk off my ass. She calls and says she decided that she thought I was staying at my boyfriend&#39;s house. I went and got the girl (also drunk) to confirm that I was in fact at her house. I felt like I got away with murder
Later that night the cops showed up so I hid in a closet covering myself with a blanket. The cops came into the house and one even came into the closet. I wasn&#39;t found. I reappeared about an hour later. My friends called me Anne Frank for the rest of the night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of my friends have been asking me about chem trails (mostly because I&#39;m a physics major so they assume I know a lot more than I actually do). It certainly seems much more plausible than the government mandating new light bulbs to brain wash the country. I can understand the motives that may be behind this but from a scientific point can someone explain how this is supposed work large scale? I mean for it to work it  sounds like the chemicals used would either have to be incredibly potent or dispersed in huge quantities. I apologize for my ignorance, I haven&#39;t done much personal research, just trying to develop an understanding on the how rather than the why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But wait - one of these things is not the other.</p>

<p>The claim that a lot of people object to - me included - is that a large fraction of all commercial jets are involved in distributing chemtrails, and that all contrails are in fact chemtrails.</p>

<p>The existence of HAARP is a matter of fact, and so are Russian attempts at weather modification.  Cloud seeding has been attempted for three generations now, though its effectiveness has been spotty.</p>

<p>And that the US or other governments might be interested in geoengineering is undeniable.</p>

<p>But to jump from that to &quot;the entire airline industry is engaged in a huge conspiracy&quot; is not a tenable leap...</p>

<p>Nobody claims that.  I suggest you check and recheck.  </p>

<p>Again, a few fleets of military planes following orders, to drones, has nothing to do with the commercial airline industry</p>

<p>Yes, but its purpose is disputed vehemently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious, because the word &quot;Chemtrails&quot; gets thrown around a lot and in a lot of different contexts, what is your claim regarding chemtrails exactly? When many people hear chemtrails they assume that you mean all contrails are actually chemtrails. Who do you claim (certain commercial flights at the request of the government, or certain military flights, or some other government black flights) are distributing chemtrails? </p>

<p><strong>no one makes either of those claims.</strong></p>
