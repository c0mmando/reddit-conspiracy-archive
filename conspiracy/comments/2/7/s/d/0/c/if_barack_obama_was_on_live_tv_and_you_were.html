       I feel like Presidents always carefully control who is allowed to film them and talk to them. If we could just get some video of people asking them the right questions that they didn't have pre-scripted answers for, they might go viral.

       I would start my piece by reminding him of what he said about bush and hiw bush increased our national debt, and how obama said (while still a senator running for president) that continually raising the debt limit is a mark of poor leadership. Then i would continue by reminding him that in the six years he has been president, our national debt has increased more than in bush's eight years, and i would remind him of his administrations repeated lifting of the debt ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then i would ask him my question:
      </p>
      <p>
       "What does this say about YOUR leadership. I know what senator obama would say to that question, but what about president obama?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then i would ask him if hes really gay or not.

       It is important to know and understand a presidents back ground when making a decision about him.  A persons college records are a link to an important part of a persons life, a point that often helps shape him.  For what reason did you have your college records sealed and are you willing to unseal them now that you can no longer run for office?

       That isn't the only source that's made that claim.

      <p>
       Where's the evidence that he
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       go to Columbia?  Why hasn't he ever released his transcripts?  Why does he refuse to answer questions about Columbia when asked?  Why didn't he include anything about his time there in his memoirs?  Why did his senior essay go missing?  Why did none of the ~400 of his classmates that Fox News contacted remember him?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's all this controversy and vagueness about his past, why wouldn't he just release the files and end all of the discussion?

       And he's no Pelosi. He might stammer a bit but I bet he'd be pretty smooth. Most people would probably be impressed by his ability to respond on the fly or some bullshit.

       I'm sure it would be a lie, but a correctly worded question that he is not prepared to answer would still take him off guard and possibly catch him in his own words. A viral video of the President basically admitting to something bad would be a huge blow to TPTB.

       Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst, has stated that "I know from a good friend who was there when it happened, that at a small dinner with progressive supporters â€“ after these progressive supporters were banging on Obama before the election, Why donâ€™t you do the things we thought you stood for? Obama turned sharply and said, "Donâ€™t you remember what happened to Martin Luther King Jr.?"

       President Obama, have you made at any time a statement like this? If so, did someone threatened you or your family?

       Turned a blind eye to corruption, allowed domestic spying and has let government agencies do what ever they feel like. He may not have directly been the singular force but he was certainly in a position to stop it and turned a blind eye and allowed a very slippery slope to begin
