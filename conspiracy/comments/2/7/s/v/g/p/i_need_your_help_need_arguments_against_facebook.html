        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I had a conversation with a friend and I told him that I deleted my facebook account because of the recent developments in the NSA affairs and also the  fact that the facebook app is constantly recording you through the microphone of your phone. I told him that they track everything of you and that I don´t want to give them more information about me. He laughed at me and said: &quot; What do they want to do with this information? If I´m not breaking any law, I don´t have to fear or care. It´s just for security purpose. Facebook is essential in life, you can stay in contact with your relatives (through a screen lol) and stay in touch with your loved ones.&quot; I couldn´t find any reasonable argument as I was quite stunned by his argumentation. He doesn´t even care about privacy, or spying or whatever...</p>

<p>I need your arguments as I´m quite a newby on this topic.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

Not only does he have no privacy, but every piece of information and every picture he uploads to facebook no longer belongs to him--he has forfeited all ownership (and if pics or status updates are used for marketing purposes, he&#39;ll receive no compensation).  </p>

I thought the way they brought in the Snowden revelations at the end was admirable considering the revelations were published while the film was in post production.  They added as much as they could as an addendum without pushing their release date too far, or getting off topic since the focus was heavily on clicking &quot;I Agree.&quot; </p>

</blockquote>

<p>It would help if you got your facts striaght. They do not constantly record, that would be ridiculous and impossible.</p>

<p>They <em>can</em> record at their whim without notifying you though. Both are bad but it&#39;s an important distinction and if you are hoping to wake anyone up you had better not leave any wiggle room to make you look wrong.</p>

<p>But really to answer your question, if someone in 2014 isn&#39;t aware of what privacy means they probably don&#39;t have a strong grasp of history. Someone like this is probably a lost cause.</p>

In my opinion it´s really sad that people don´t care about privacy, healthy food and so on. They go to work for 9 hours, come home and start eating their junk food and watching this BS on TV. 
Itmakes me really sad to see this and not being able to stop it. When I told my friends about conspiracies they just laughed at me. Moreover , as I told them about history they said: &quot; History already happen,what do you want to change? You can´t change history.&quot;</p>
