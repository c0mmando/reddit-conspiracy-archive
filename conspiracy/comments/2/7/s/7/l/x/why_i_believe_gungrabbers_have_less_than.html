        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I would like to start off by saying i dont necessarily believe sandy hook was a false flag. Or the aurora shootings, navy yard, even the las vegas shootings recently. Is it possible one or more are false flags? Yes. But i wont pretend to know whether they are or not. But, fortunately that doesnt matter for this post.</p>

<p>What i have observed, is IMMEDIATELY after any of these shootings, the media blows up with assumptions. Then, politicians and other gun-grabbers start their trite explanations as to why we need to ban guns. This, before actually figuring out the real details to the situation. All they know, ever, is someone shot some people. Thats it.</p>

<p>Ill reference the recent las vegas shootings for a moment. Harry reid is currently using this situation as yet another platform of attack on guns. He claims he wants universal background checks in light of this recent shooting. The thing is, the investigators dont know how the shooters got guns in the first place! Yet, they say universal background checks will stop this kind of event from happening. </p>

<p>How is it that they believe they have the answer before they even know the question?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are wrong. In many if not most cultures of old, the lower classes were strictly forbidden from owning weapons. Pitchforks, axes, and scythes were tools. Bows and arrows, likewise, were tools for hunting, not war. As an example, think of all the weapons used in Asian martial arts that aren&#39;t swords and spears, these are all farming tools that were adapted for use as weapons by a peasant class who was forbidden to use weapons. The peasants were the ones mining the iron and smithing the blades, they certainly had access to the weapons, they made them. They were not allowed to own them under any circumstances however. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US government lacks the money and man power to &quot;roundup&quot; every gun in the country.</p>

<p>Here are some numbers.</p>

<p>According to americangunfacts.com there are approx 270,000,000 civilian owned guns.</p>

<p>If the government started to round them all up they would have to collect 739,726 a day, seven days a week for an entire year to get them all.  </p>

<p>Or only 184,931 a day, seven days a week for 4 years. (An entire presidential term) </p>

<p>Secondly every single administration knows that the day they even try to take law abiding citizens guns by force, is the day an armed uprising will begin.</p>

<p>Im not some leftwing anti gun person, I own 3, (plus a stripped AR lower if you want to count that)</p>

<p>But the reality is they aren&#39;t going to come and grab them.<br/>
Regulate?  Probably.  But regulation and taking by force are VERY different situations.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Thats not what im arguing. I agree, they are two very different situations. But what im saying is that those two, very different, situations are connect by only one variable. Time.</p>

<p>Right now, it might be okay. Like i said before in my other comments, i used to be okay with universal background checks. But, then after i researched more than a little bit, i realized that whether or not our current leaders are trying to establish tyranny is irrelevant. What is relevant is that by forcing universal background checks, you create legal precedence in favor of infringing on the right to bear arms. What is relevant is by forcing universal background checks consolidates all the information concerning who has firearms, and where the live/work etc., into one small place. You can call it a database, you can call it a registration, you can call it whatever you like. All that information in one tiny place/transaction will certainly be recorded, if not now, then eventually. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not our politicians are trying to do this with the honestly best intentions, we are still telling them that this is not the road we want to go down as a country. It is their job to listen.</p>

<p>As for your argument of the registration...
I disagree, simply because I see anti-gun legislation fail constantly. </p>

<p>A sitting congresswoman got shot.  Nothing happened. </p>

<p>A class of children got killed.  Nothing happened. </p>

<p>The gun industry has never had better sales since Obamas inauguration.  And getting .22 ammo is still next to impossible (where I live at least) and for months last year I had to buy 9mm and .40 reloaded ammo because its so scarce. </p>

<p>In reality I think the gun industry, and NRA need people scared of a &quot;gun-grab&quot;.  So they will buy more guns, ammo, and NRA memberships. </p>

<p>Im not going to assume the NRAs motives.  But I will throw this out.  A couple months back Wayne LaPierre wrote an article in American Rifleman talking about a gun treaty the US was going to sign on to that would essentially outlaw certain guns in the US.  And how the US was handing over control of its laws to the international community.</p>

<p>What he didn&#39;t say in the article is our Constitution will supersede all treaties in all situations.  And that the supreme court had ruled on a situation like this years prior and upheld it.</p>

<p>Therefore had the US signed on to the treaty (we ultimately didn&#39;t) it wouldn&#39;t have mattered anyway.  It would have changed NOTHING. </p>

<p>The replacement glass was there before the police and ambulance arrived, if by some crazy coincidence they had it out back, they wouldn&#39;t have moved it through the blood etc before police got there.</p>

<p>There was a shell casing amongst the blood in the store that was being cleaned up by the store owners..</p>

<p>Not only should it have been outside where it was fired but it should have been collected as evidence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s illegal for the store owners to clean up the biohazard.</p>

<p>Multiple witnesses said there was 2 in the car.</p>

<p>The lack of blood in the car.</p>

<p>The staged crime scene where the damaged bike was moved into position alongside the car, it wasn&#39;t there the night it happened.</p>

<p>One of the &#39;injured&#39; that was shot 5 times not only didn&#39;t receive treatment but was found to be an actor, as usual.</p>

<p>There&#39;s endless extremely suspicious tidbits as well which tends to be enough for most who know this stuff (terrible acting etc) but I&#39;ll leave it out for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally any movement made by politicians regarding guns doesn&#39;t seem to be thought out. I live in the good old communist republic of New Jersey, where being a gun owner is painful. Besides having an assault weapon ban, we also have background check requirements on pistols. &quot;its only one quick background check, stop whining, what are you a criminal with a record? Why is it such a big deal?&quot; Well whenever i apply for a permit, i have to pay the fees and complete the proper paperwork. Then, i wait usually around four months for someone to finally get around to sending it out. Then, i have to hope that they remember to tell me to pick it up, otherwise i will have a permit that expires within the week because sometime was too lazy to pick up a phone. If it&#39;s that inefficient for such a small area, could you imagine how screwed up it would be at the national level? Think the NFA, except a thousands times worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a gun owner and I think that a universal background check wouldn&#39;t be helpful. People lie about their background to get into college, get a job, to get a driver&#39;s license. People probably do try to lie to get a gun. At least it would weed out those people. </p>

<p>Of course no background check will stop a criminal intent on getting a gun. </p>

<p>It seems to me that many of these shootings are by people who are taking or have recently stopped taking some kind of antidepressant. So many of those drugs have warnings that they cause violent thoughts and suicidal thoughts. We have a mental health crisis in this country. </p>

<p>But how do you address it? Saying &quot;hey let&#39;s make a law that if you take Zoloft, you have to turn in your guns&quot; would piss off the gun industry and the pharmaceutical industry in one go, and I don&#39;t see any politician wanting to take that on. Plus there are issues of doctor patient confidentiality and scaring people off from seeking help. </p>

<p>EDIT: crap I wrote above that I thought background checks wouldn&#39;t be helpful...I meant to say they would be helpful to weed out people that might lie about their application! As a gun owner I fully support background checks.</p>

...you can scratch that out now, thanks to obamacare.</p>

<p>But yes, this has become a very delicate issue. You are right that if we just banned people who have certain prescriptions from owning guns, we woukd be pissing in a lot of peoplez cheerios. However, i feel that is a bettet solution (still not one that woukd suffice) than banning guns altogether, or passing meaningless legislation that wont work.</p>

<p>Instead, i woukd like to see certain scripts be accompanied by regular, maybe three times a week (seems like a lot though, maybe just once a week) visits to the psychologist for an hr or something. I dunno, honestly. I dont have the solution myself. I just feel very strongly that our politicians solutions are not what is going to fix this issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible to buy guns in a <strong>direct person-to-person sale</strong> in most free states without a background check.  That is a good thing, and Universal background checks will absolutely not end that practice, especially without a federal registry.  </p>

<p>Why, you ask?  Because if I own a gun that the government doesn&#39;t have a record of, and I want to sell it to a friend, how will the government know I went to an FFL and got a background check for my friend, even if it is &quot;required by law&quot;?  They have no way of knowing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is not lying. He is merely educating you on his take on this issue.</p>

<p>It just happens that he is right. Background checks can be a good thing (i used to be for them). But, with the revelations and the ensuing lies thereafter if the NSA spying bullshit, we cant trust the government to contain the information of who has guns where. Did you learn nothing in history class back in highschool about how the nazis made their folks register their guns so that they knew where to go to confiscate them?</p>

<p>Now, i know what youre gonna say. Your gonna say, &quot;but this isnt nazi germany. Our government isnt going to confiscate the guns.&quot; To that i can say &quot;thats what the population in nazi germany thought, too.&quot; But i feel that would suffice for you.</p>

<p>The point is, believe it or not, this country is on a dangerous road towards tyranny. Even IF our current politicians and leaders and officials truely have our best interests at heart, they are paving the road for later generations of crooks and cronies who will be, easily, able to take advantage of the system. There is no denying it. </p>

<p>A universal background check, although at face value seems like a great idea to me, just isnt worth the risk of having it abused later on. Its just one step away from a registry, which, if weve learned anytbing about the nsa  revelations, we KNOW they will tap into that information and create a federal registry, even if it isnt made known to the public. </p>

<p>Btw, to conduct a background check, guess what you have to do? You have to give them your information, into a computer, to see your files and history and stuff. Its literally just one button click away from saving that information along with the guns purchased. Its not farfetched. </p>

<p>Whether or not you believe this will happen is irrelevant. Hell, i dont believe that it will definately happen. But im not willing to side with thise who are willing to allow the possibility for this to happen.</p>

<p>Most states... so really the only tangible change a universal background check would have is that the states that don&#39;t already have them, would have them?</p>

<p>That fear is manufactured within peoples&#39; minds and not written down in the background check laws, right? There are gun registries already, in some states, right? Which are separate from background checks?</p>

<p>In neither case is there a reality of &quot;gun-grabbing&quot;, right?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Good. Felons shouldn&#39;t own guns. Neither should people with a history of violence toward humans or animals. Neither should people with a history of mental or emotional illness.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Guns are for protecting oneself, and, I guess, hunting.</p>

<p>Felons and people with a history of violence have already shown a pattern of behavior of causing harm to others, or in the case of violence against animals a clear indicator that they&#39;re near to causing harm to people, therefore their ability to retain the &quot;self defense only&quot; aspect of the gun is reasonably called into question.</p>

<p>Those with a history of mental or emotional illness have established a pattern of being unable to process situations rationally and therefore their ability to understand the difference between self-defense and shooting the shit out of anything, any time, is reasonably called into question.</p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s going to confiscate guns. They might start passing laws that make it harder and harder to get guns and, through attrition over decades or generations, eventually nobody will have them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be a felon, you have to be convicted for a crime with a punishment of no less than a year in jail? I may be wrong, only taken one law class in my life. When you are in possession of more than an ounce of that good good, your possession charge includes an intent to distribute.</p>

<p>As to the background checks, we have a regulated firearm market in this country already, any additional checks is going to be record keeping. Another point to consider about background checks is that the Santa Barbara shooter had four handguns, which means he was referenced four times, once month for each purchase, you can only purchase one handgun a month in California</p>

<p>Judges have a lot of leeway in sentencing. Convicted felons can and do get probation - no jail time.</p>

<p>There must be more to the person&#39;s story. It either wasn&#39;t his first conviction and all priors were misdemeanors, or he had a shitload of the stuff (kilos, not ounces), or he did something really, really stupid in the court to piss the judge off.</p>

Obviously, if a gun grab is the MO, They wouldn&#39;t come right out with it. Feinstein wants additional background checks,and on record seeks to take mister and misses Americas firearms. Holder advocates additional background checks,and on record seeks to brainwash Americans opinions in firearms. This all obviously stems from distrust of our leaders rather than actual claims of gun grabs</p>

<p>As for the weed, I&#39;ve seen people convicted of felony possession and intent, only do a month or two bid, followed by the rest of the sentence in probo. Still makes them felons, and therefore second class citizens doomed to unemployment, and lack of a second amendment right, because of a plant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I advocate for thorough background checks (which obviously aren&#39;t happening now in many cases) but don&#39;t want to take anyone&#39;s firearms (who would pass the background checks).</p>

<p>I mean, you point out two politicians who want to grab guns. There are more, sure. There are a lot of politicians, conservative and liberal alike, who aren&#39;t interested in grabbing guns. And there is at least an equal number of politicians who want to protect your right to own a gun no matter what, dammit, because that&#39;s what they believe or they&#39;re in the NRA&#39;s pocket.</p>

<p>TL;DR: just because a couple politicians want to grab guns doesn&#39;t mean it will or even can happen.</p>

<p>Until confiscation is encoded into the law, it&#39;s not the law. That&#39;s my point. Background checks aren&#39;t gun grabs. They&#39;re just background checks.</p>

<p>On the weed thing, I&#39;d really like to hear the rest of the story from the guy who started telling it... because he&#39;s obviously only told us part of it but he&#39;s trying to use it as proof of... something...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly it&#39;s a difficult situation. Everyone, antigun and pro gun, want a clear cut solution to mass shootings. This is already a flawed thought process, because you can never create a utopia(obviously). What makes it even more flawed is that many believe a clear cut solution will come from legislation! Absolutely ridiculous, because legislation does not deter crime, it punishes it, the punishment is the the crime deterrent. Everyone in this country needs to take a moment and appreciate the value of safety. What really is safety? Who is dependent on your safety, and who is responsible for it? </p>

<p>children aren&#39;t prepared to take account of their own safety, obviously. By saying we can&#39;t afford armed responders on campus, we are putting a price on a child&#39;s life.</p>

<p>The only person responsible for your safety is yourself, this notion has been confirmed by our court system when they ruled that the police are not obligated to protect, only enforce laws. </p>

<p>In my opinion, the solution to mass shootings is going to have to come within. We need to accept that the pharmaceutical Industry has literally created a proliferation on premeditated suicides, and homicides followed by suicides, after resulting in mass casualties. Until the media quits pushing the urban legend status of these killers, we have to have constant vigilance, because these situations start and end in seconds.
<a href="http://m.newburyportnews.com/TDNN/db_/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=jwaBz1SM">I personally wouldn&#39;t want to have laws further restricting my access to firearms. Real life example, one of these situations almost occurred in my neighborhood, and the nine millimeter would not have penetrated kevlar</a> he was evading police for hours, and its lucky he didn&#39;t enter any homes
 End rant I suppose
As for the weed, I guess my point was that it&#39;s not fair to fall to the lowest caste of American society because of weed :p</p>

<p>You are right aboutbthis, no doubt. But you are failing to see the impottance of legal precedence. This would enable them, down the road (in the future) to establish a registry and possibly confiscation.</p>

<p>The issue is not what it affects now, it is what could it affect later. And pro-gun folks dont want even the possibility of any affects later. Thats all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 2nd amendment is the reason we shouldn&#39;t get rid of guns.</p>

<p>Do we rule ourselves or is there some imaginary entity called the government that is somehow smarter than people, supremely morale and ordained by god to have control over our lives?</p>

<p>Should we give up control of our right to personal defense?  That is what this is about.  Should we contract out our well being to the government so that we have to wait 30-45 minutes to be saved from a rapist because of some policy on response time at the police department?</p>

<p>From where I stand your argument seems to be &quot;save me, I&#39;m weak!&quot;  So while you&#39;re waiting for 45 minutes to be saved from a rapist, or being eaten by wolves on a hiking trail, I&#39;ll be just fine.  Oh and if your government is being ran by psychopaths who want to round you up because of your religion race or creed.

<p>But regulation and taking by force are VERY different situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats not what im arguing. I agree, they are two very different situations. But what im saying is that those two, very different, situations are connect by only one variable. Time.</p>

<p>Right now, it might be okay. Like i said before in my other comments, i used to be okay with universal background checks. But, then after i researched more than a little bit, i realized that whether or not our current leaders are trying to establish tyranny is irrelevant. What is relevant is that by forcing universal background checks, you create legal precedence in favor of infringing on the right to bear arms. What is relevant is by forcing universal background checks consolidates all the information concerning who has firearms, and where the live/work etc., into one small place. You can call it a database, you can call it a registration, you can call it whatever you like. All that information in one tiny place/transaction will certainly be recorded, if not now, then eventually. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not our politicians are trying to do this with the honestly best intentions, we are still telling them that this is not the road we want to go down as a country. It is their job to listen.</p>
