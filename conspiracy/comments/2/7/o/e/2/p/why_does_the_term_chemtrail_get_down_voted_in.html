        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like, for some reason, most people don&#39;t believe in or understand what chemtrails are. First, chemtrail is the layman&#39;s term for cloud seeding. Yes, there is some evidence that there are heavy metals in some of the cloud seeding rain samples, but not in all cases. Cloud seeding is the more general term. </p>

<p>Second, there are private companies that offer rain production services on a daily basis. Just visit <a href="http://www.weathermodification.com">www.weathermodification.com</a> to see for yourself (sorry for no link, on mobile). </p>

<p>So why is it that this sub seems to hate discussion about chemtrails? Is it that the word has a pejorative connotation and automatically turns some people off? Or is it that people don&#39;t believe it even actually exists?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you so anxious to associate the word chemtrails with geo-engineering? Nobody ever described the Vietnam &quot;extended monsoon&quot; as chemtrails. The &#39;chemtrails&#39; criss-crossing the sky which I&#39;m told I have to &quot;look up&quot; at have nothing to do with any geo-engineering project in existence. Apart from trapping a bit of heat, they are harmless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t call it anxious but the overwhelming majority of people in the world have zero knowledge of the fact that we were actually manipulating the weather in Vietnam. I&#39;m sure there are quite a few people who think that sort of technology is relegated to science fiction. Had there been knowledge back then of what was going on, seeing as the clouds were seeded with chemicals, we can&#39;t say they wouldn&#39;t have called them chemtrails then. I think the argument at hand has more to do with a general mistrust for the government, which causes people to worry about the things they don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t think demonizing the term chemtrail necessarily fixes anything.</p>

<p>if all those trails you see in the sky every sunny day these days are geo-engineering or weather modification or contrails is the only thing up for debate in this &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. and can be checked with flight path data from your local airport/s and various websites along with analysis of water, soil and air samples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People take geo-engineering very seriously, but so-called chemtrails are not part of any geo-engineering project or plan. Solar Radiation Management (SRM) involves some general ideas: Very high-level spraying to act as a solar reflector; mid-level removal of cirrus clouds (Cirrus Stripping) to prevent heat being trapped underneath them; and Maritime Cloud Brightening to increase low-level cloud cover.</p>

<p>SRM involves spraying sulphides or reflective materials into the stratosphere at about 80,000 feet – way above the 50,000 foot ceiling of commercial airliners or military tankers.</p>

<p>Cirrus stripping involves removing clouds from the upper troposphere between 40,000 and 60,000 feet. Aircraft leaving contrails are actually making this problem worse. That is what contrails really are – artificial cirrus clouds.</p>

<p>Maritime Cloud Brightening only takes place in the bottom few thousand feet of the atmosphere and uses ships to pump seawater into a spray which will form the low-level clouds.</p>

<p>Commercial airliners leaving contrails are flying at between 25,000 feet and 40,000 feet – too high for MCB and too low for SRM. So explain to me how aircraft leaving ordinary contrails are part of geo-engineering.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just bullshit.  It can occur at any height.  In fact, regular contrails themselves without anything added are a form of SRM as they reduce temperature.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What, precisely, can occur at any height? And don&#39;t just answer &quot;geoengineering&quot;. What PART of geoengineering do you think causes white trails hundreds of miles long at between 25,000 and 40,000 feet, which sometimes cover the entire sky with a white haze?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget, this is NOT Stratospheric Aerosol Spraying and it&#39;s not Maritime Cluos Brightening, and it&#39;s obviously not Cirrus Stripping, so what is it?</p>

<p>But you are right. Even persistent contrails are a serious threat to the balance of the ecology - hence the idea of Cirrus Stripping to get rid of the clouds and the contrails. But HOW they will achieve that is another matter. Every geo project that&#39;s been suggested comes with a list of reasons why it could go wrong.</p>

<p>Edit: I just noticed you said that contrails reduce temperatures. You don&#39;t know much, do you? Why do you even bother coming into a debate like this without doing some basic research. If you look at Cirrus Stripping you&#39;ll find that high-level Cirrus cloud actually traps heat. Sunlight can easily penetrate it and warm the Earth, but the infrared which Earth normally emits straight out into space gets trapped by the underside of the cloud layer and adds to global warming.</p>

<p>Sorry, bitch, but is you that doesn&#39;t know much.</p>

<p>&quot;Another study that took advantage of the grounding gave striking evidence of what contrails can do. David Travis of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and two colleagues measured the difference, over those three contrail-free days, between the highest daytime temperature and the lowest nighttime temperature across the continental U.S. They compared those data with the average range in day-night temperatures for the period 1971-2000, again across the contiguous 48 states. Travis&#39;s team discovered that from roughly midday September 11 to midday September 14, the days had become warmer and the nights cooler, with the overall range greater by about two degrees Fahrenheit.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/contrail-effect.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/contrail-effect.html</a></p>

<p>tl;dr for your dumb ass - for three days after 9/11 there were no contrails in the sky, and this was determined to be the cause of the increased temperatures.    </p>

<p>Why is it that you can&#39;t say anything that isn&#39;t demonstrably wrong?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apology accepted. But I am not &quot;people like me&quot;, I am Me and I have a post history you are welcome to go through. The reason I debunk chemtrails is because they are part of a deliberate or accidental disinformation paradigm. The white trails in the sky are just clouds of ice crystals.</p>

<p>But all the time people are telling me to look up at the harmless contrails I may be missing what is going on under my very nose. Geo-engineering poses a real and serious threat to the survival of the planet. There is supposed to be a ban on any major schemes, but there is a loophole which allows small-scale experiments and local Cloud busting. So you can be sure that the military are experimenting the hell out of it. Check out Kristen Meghan on YouTube to find out the sorts of things the military are doing. </p>

<p>But they are not doing it by creating hundred mile long plumes of white cloud across clear blue skies. For a start, there isn&#39;t an aircraft built which could carry that amount of any substance to that altitude and create a cloud that big. Some of those persistent contrails must contain thousands of tons of ice. Secondly, if you were an evil government wanting to secretly spray chemicals on your people, don&#39;t you think you&#39;d find a slightly more subtle way of doing it?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you get the idea that I am a geo-engineering denier. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m a chemtrail debunker, and for good reason. All the while the loony tunes tinfoil hat brigade convinces people that contrails are the enemy, they&#39;ll give the real culprit a clean pass.</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t simply white trails.  They start out as white trails that more or less look like contrails, but spread out to cover the entire sky in a white haze that is identical to what would occur with some types of geoengineering - look up for example Al Gore&#39;s interview with Ellen Degeneres when they discuss chemtrails - he says one thing he doesn&#39;t like about them is that we would no longer have the blue sky we are accustomed too - this is precisely what I am already seeing.  Airplanes turning the whole sky white is a new phenomenon that I didn&#39;t see a <em>single time</em> more then ten years ago. </p>

<p>They are using some kind of cloud condensation nuclei.  </p>

<p>Listen sir, in my opinion, if you want to fight geoengineering, I suggest that you wrap your head around the fact that they are already doing it. They think that the solution to pollution is more pollution, and quite frankly it is a fucking horror to me that these people think this way.  </p>

<p>Here is how the Nobel Prize winning Paul Crutzen ended his paper <em>Albedo Enhancement by Stratospheric Sulfur Injections</em>:  &quot;Finally, I repeat: the very best would be if emissions of the greenhouse gases could be reduced so much that the stratospheric sulfur release experiment would not need to take place. Currently, this looks like a pious wish.&quot;    </p>

<p>He is saying that if we don&#39;t reduce greenhouse gas emissions are <em>only</em> recourse will be to alter the environment through geoengineering.  </p>

<p>No, what Al Gore said is that one of the major drawbacks of geoengineering the sky (aka chemtrails) is that the sky would no longer be blue when you do this.  Anyone can see that this is already taking place.  Again, airplanes 10 years ago used to leave contrails - these would usually disappear rather quickly, if not more or less immediately.  Now airplanes will often leave something behind that looks initially like a contrail, but it persists, and eventually spreads out and <em>covers the entire sky with a white haze.</em>  This <strong>never</strong> used to happen.  This is a phenomenon which anyone can observe for themselves.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon. When it burns in air the carbon part combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (Dihydrogen Monoxide, H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is already saturated with water vapour then these crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through a process called deposition and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, you should really learn a bit about meteorology before spouting off what you think &quot;should* happen. Whereever you are in the world, the air temperature will drop below freezing at two miles altitude. At the altitude airliners fly at, the temperature is about -50 degrees centigrade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes. There are fuckwits out there who run into the garden with a hand sprayer full of vinegar every time they see a contrail in the sky. They believe that a couple of puffs of vinegar into the air can disperse a 50 mile long &#39;Chemtrail&#39; that&#39;s 8 miles up in the atmosphere within minutes. There is one person who posts here who proudly tells us that he sprays his children with vinegar whenever a contrail appears.</p>
