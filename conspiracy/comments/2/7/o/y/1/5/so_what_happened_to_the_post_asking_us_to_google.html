       that looks like it. the mystery remains: why was the post "disappeared" and who "disappeared" it?

       it did attract shill attention in its short life, that much i noticed. so i guess its true.

       Here you go. It took me all of 30 seconds to find it by using my browser history.

       Your immediate reaction that it was shills or whatnot that removed the link/post without actually doing more than vaguely searching is frankly troubling.

       Try harder. You are not powerless.

       You look like a crank when you claim shills behind every bush, when the problem is your own ignorance and unwillingness to challenge your notions of reality, because none of us have all the answers, and thinking that you know how it is, is letting the other side win. The tao, baby, the tao.

       OP was right, submission was removed. You could only get to it via your browsing history/reddit user account.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've reinstated the submission and will have a talk with the mod who pulled the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       He most likely removed it thinking it was a vacuous post sans context; but I'd argue the removal was unwarranted. Hell I learned about the patent for the first time through the post myself!

       Thanks for letting us know. Could you ask Flytape to confirm that this was the reason he deleted the post?

       Regardless, nothing disappears on the internet. It doesn't take that much effort to find what you are looking for.

       The number one tactic police agencies use is to foster paranoia in groups they target, making everyone think that people are informants or agent provacteurs. Paranoia makes people say and do foolish things and destroy the bonds of friendship and community that they forge thru shared experience.

       Also, I'm a dick who gets tired of where did this post go posts. Reddit is coopted. The owners of the site have their agenda. Ultimately, my comments are just me working for free and generating content for said owners. Reddit is not a commons, no matter how much it aspires to be one.

       This is true to some extent, but if we hold this site accountable to the organic curation of content then the maxim of free flowing information has not entirely died off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is absolutely co opted. But it has many competing factions (some with a lot more power and influence than others).
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti-censorship crowd is a very important (albeit marginalized) aspect of those commenting factions. I give a lot of my time and energy into this site defending the free flow of information. While I realize that this ends up profiting reddit inc insofar as they can say "hey look, there are people like AATA going around unabated; we're clearly not corrupt!", I also realize that without keeping tabs on metadrama and censorship this place would be a lot worse off.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's really shitty about reddit is that certain mod factions have silent admin support and use that to bully around other users and mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       The type of vitriolic hatred that some of these factions spew in order to further their aims is pretty disgusting, but I've pretty much come to terms with the fact that there are some very devious organizations who have a stake in controlling the flow of information on this website.

       Yea, this is also true. But certain mods of certain subs have gone so far as to delete links from the top of their
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       lists. Also, some subs dedicate their entire mod team to removing content from the new queue so
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       won't watch the removals. Curating content for nefarious ends happens on reddit all the time and should be called out. That is why we flair posts with subreddit tags when other mods remove content. Accountability is important precisely because certain other sub's mods are inclined to use backrooms rather than public discussion. This is why I prefer to discuss issues publicly in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Full transparency is far superior to backroom deliberations.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, this medium (and the censorship thereof) is entirely pertinent with regards the current social hexis and I hope holding mods accountable for their removals is something which never stops.
