       Agreed that every event of significance or controversy will often at the least have
       <em>
        potential
       </em>
       to be of a conspiratorial
      </p>
      <p>
       When an event like this initially emerges, obvious red flags aside, it never hurts for one to ask questions and to speculate, without jumping to any firm conclusions based on said speculation immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you have a society managed by sociopathic leaders and LEOs, and when TPTB often pull their strings in ways that can be unexpected to say the least in order to further their own agendas, it is generally best not to take anything you hear on the corporate-government media, Internet nor independent media as gospel or at face value until you can hear all sides of the controversy, review all the evidence and form your own conclusions.

       the facebook page sounds bullshit to me, the video from someone's living room?  it sounds off.
      </p>
      <p>
       something might have happened, or was supposed to happen, but I'm sure we're being lied to for some reason.   it reminds me of the 'friendly dog guy' also from NB who was a prison guard with Marfans, sent to Toronto to shoot up the beaches.   He backed out and the police made up several different stories about the incident.. right before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       shortly before another election, the streets of Toronto were shot up on boxing day.

       as you know the mayor of Toronto is connected to gun running drug gangs.

       Are you suggesting that the government  faked a video of a shooting, but didn't use actual gunshots for the audio?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize how unbelievably stupid that is?
      </p>
      <p>
       The government owns plenty of guns and shooting ranges. Why on earth would they try to artificially replicate the sound of gunshots instead of recording some real gunshots? Hell, they could just go on YouTube and take an audio snippet from any number of videos that include real guns being fired.

       it's not a gunshot, there's no doppler effect.  the object that made the sound was moving at a relatively low velocity.  keep  denying, ridiculing, discrediting, whatever.. we're used to that kind of harassment here.

       Just answer me this: For what conceivable reason would the government use fake gunshot audio instead of using readily available audio of real gunshots?
      </p>
      <p>
       They could record gunshot audio at any number of military/police shooting ranges. Or they could take snippets of audio from any of the thousands of videos on the internet of real guns being fired (pretty much any FPSRussia video or hunting video).

       I only said that I thought it sounded more like a book hitting the floor in my professional opinion.   First lets look at the doppler characteristics of the sounds, and then we can draw conclusions as to what is impossible.   don't be impatient with ambiguity.

       Gun shots are routinely confused with doors slamming shut, heavy objects dropping on the floor, or firecrackers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think it sounds like a book dropped on the floor, you could actually be right, because that's more or less what a gun shot sounds. Especially when recorded with shitty equipment, like a smartphone, and potentially encoded/compressed.

       Well, if you think it's such a easy thing to verify, what don't you do it? Aren't you a audio expert? Aren't you the one coming up out of nowhere with this claim?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an article on the topic:

       I like this part:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So, a typical sound wave for a single gunshot looks like this:
[...]
In practice, of course, a real-life gunshot recording will never be so perfectly formed. Amateur audio recordings are usually poor quality, with interference from voices, screams and echoes. Furthermore, the sound of the gunshot will depend on the position of the recorder relative to the shooter.
       </p>

       I'm not talking about a perfect gunshot recording, I'm talking about the doppler effect.  Do you know what it is?

       It's a cellphone video, taken from inside a house - of course the audio isn't going to be perfect! What kind of unreal expectations do you have? Do you do this to try and prove your point? How disrespectful. Three RCMP members are dead, and you're trying to say they didn't die? What's your version of the events. You seem to think you know.

       It's not street view - it's "photo spheres" - try to navigate up or down a road; you can't do it. Hold the peg man, and look at the map - the countries bordering Germany turn blue, showing areas of coverage. Germany itself has almost no blue, meaning No streetview coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an example of the blurring effect, seen in a tiny part of Germany that does allow street view -
