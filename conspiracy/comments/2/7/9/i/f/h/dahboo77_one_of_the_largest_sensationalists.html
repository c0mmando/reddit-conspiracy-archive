His latest garbage involves &quot;UFO Orbs&quot; in Ukraine showing up everywhere during battle when they&#39;re clearly tracer rounds, and not one but TWO videos of it (can&#39;t forget to upload the &quot;enhanced version&quot;) His next one involves a plane crash that was apparently &quot;a hit on Lewis Katz,&quot; co-owner of the Inquirer because of a &quot;contract dispute.&quot; lol I swear, the guy will take ANY news story and as if he has a list of conspiracy&#39;s written out, he&#39;ll just spin the bottle and sensationalize which ever one it lands on into a story.</p>

<p>Same with that redpillrevolution channel, what the hell is happening to these people, they need to take a break and come back to reality. According to the guy at redpillrevolution every single mass shooting is fake and there are no crazy people in the world, (even this last one with Elliot Rodgers) because the store owners were moping up <del>blood</del> <em>fake blood</em> and there was a shell casing left behind, oh and there was a photo with a bike inside of the crime scene. They, and I say they because one of his latest (FINAL PROOFS!) videos on the shooting has another lady screaming False Flag because a bicycle was in one photo of the crime scene, then a day later it was removed. </p>

<p>They took this as the bike was put there and staged, she even contacted someone who dealt in hazardous material and said that because it&#39;s illegal to clean up blood the whole thing was fake lol. Oh and let&#39;s not forget the windows, because the <del>store owners</del> <em>(professional handlers in hazardous waste and licensed detectives)</em> bought new windows for the store and moped up blood at the same time the windows were in boxes a few feet away, that this just adds to the story not adding up so it clearly must all be a hoax. (Their words)</p>

<p>One thing that gets me the most is all the Likes these people get, I mean just look at the comments, it&#39;s amazing how many people will believe anything they hear and take it as the end all be all. These people are like &quot;BURN IN HELL NWO! WE AREN&#39;T FALLING FOR IT!! YOU&#39;RE CAUGHT!!! DOWN WITH THE ILLUMINATI!&quot; then get 50 Thumbs Up lol. If you think I&#39;m just saying that go look at the comments on those videos, there&#39;s no shortage of crazy rhetoric. I&#39;ve been into &quot;this field&quot; for about 14 years now, I&#39;m 27 and have been around (including on YouTube since it started) for every mass shooting, every bombing, every plane crash etc. And no matter what, every single major event is fake to these people, it&#39;s just crazy how someone can think everything around them is either staged, a hoax, done by the government or (insert belief here) and then on top of that spend hours making videos about it to tell to everyone. </p>

<p>End Rant.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ridiculous talk when it comes to conspiracies, but it goes with the Territory.  I wish people were more constructive, bring evidence to the table if something is bullshit, instead of just whining about how things used to be better.

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: </p>

<p>Although I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re talking about my GIF post, I&#39;m going to post back what I had here because I want you to tell me the &quot;facts&quot; and see what you have to say.</p>

<hr/>

<p>ORG Post:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Why don&#39;t you try to provide a reason why you think the Katz plane crash could not have been deliberate?&quot;</em></p>

<p>Because LOGIC overrules conspiracy theory in the first few hours of an investigation and/or major incident. And if you give me the reasons you think it&#39;s an inside job then debate me, show me the facts you have come to believe in the first two? days since the incident occurred. Don&#39;t just throw a brick at someone because you&#39;re mad I&#39;m actually thinking something besides conspiracy here in the sub within only two days of the crash. I mean seriously, you&#39;re the one asking for my &quot;reasons&quot; why I think it&#39;s not some conspiracy but you have failed to post your reasons why you think it IS. Do you just walk around all day and think everything is a conspiracy? these kind of people are horrible for this community and deal us a major blow when it comes to others taking us seriously.</p>

<p>And, &quot;<em>a lame attempt at humour to detract from the fact that you have no provided any substance</em>.&quot; Really man? I&#39;m sorry but.. lol. Sounds like a Dahboo video. Lame humor, detracting from facts, no substance. I wasn&#39;t trying to be funny, most of what I said were their &quot;FACTS&quot; from the videos I posted.</p>

<p>So tell me, what are the facts exactly? And since you&#39;re basically saying I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, do go ahead and tell me the facts from the plane crash, his &quot;UFO&#39;s&quot; and the Elliot Rodgers case. Because you&#39;re not just going to basically call me out on my post and then not share the facts as you see them, that&#39;s the least you can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exposed? lmfao! I have been here since this started man you must be pretty new. You don&#39;t cry &quot;discredit&quot; on people who think differently, this isn&#39;t Nazi Germany, this is an open forum with every type of open mind there is and not one of them agrees with everything you believe, or I believe. I swear I&#39;m the only one here over 10 years old sometimes, I feel like I&#39;m arguing over a new toy half the time.</p>

<p><strong>I believe 9/11 was an Inside Job, I believe staged shootings happen, I believe in the agenda for a NWO, I believe alphabet contractors kill people with stories like Michael Hasting, I believe in UFO&#39;s, I believe I believe I believe etc..etc..etc.</strong> So now, do I need to keep running down the damn list for you and keep spelling it out, or was all of this easy enough for that brain of yours to comprehend?</p>

<p>The easiest way to identify contrived events is the apparent inability by the media to ask and answer even the basic questions that everyone else is asking.  In regards to eliott Rogers here, your apparently assigned pet topic (you&#39;&#39;re obviously pretty damn low on the disinfo totem pole to have been assigned this contrived mess).</p>

<p>It&#39;s fun to watch you squirm through this without addressing any points of value.  Instead following the JIDR shilling.manual to a T.  My personal favorite is the walls of text you keep throwing up that could have just as easily been said in 2 sentences.  We see through you</p>

<p>ProTip:  If we wanted propaganda pushing these obvious lies as truth, we&#39;d watch CNN/Fox/MSNBC.  NOT read your thoroughly idiotic posts.

    <div class="md"><p>You need some serious help dude, like for real. I pray to god you don&#39;t have kids, I can only imagine the type of life they may have. &quot;Now remember kids, NOTHING... repeat... <strong>NOTHING</strong> bad outside of our home actually happens, it&#39;s all fake so don&#39;t ever try to protect yourself because most likely when you see someone firing a gun at you, the bullets are fake and the people lying next to you and your classmates in pools of blood are all staged, so just remember to sit there and be calm, they will finish staging the event later and you&#39;ll be JUST fine.&quot; God, that&#39;s absolutely terrifying.</p>

<p><a href="/u/iamagod__">/u/iamagod__</a> - Lives inside a bubble of fantasy and brainwashes his children so bad they&#39;re going to turn up dead if a gun is ever near them, as according to him, &quot;every mass shooting is a staged event,&quot; and there are ZERO real depraved and horrible people in the world that disregard human life to the point of murder. If you disagree with him (even being a conspiracy realist for 15 years) he then claims you&#39;re working for the &quot;establishment&quot; and have been &quot;exposed.&quot; But in reality, someone else just has more knowledge in the field and a keen eye for real world facts, holding the little bit of logic needed to lay his insane claims to rest. This hurts his feelings to the point of deep rage and anger, as proving his long held beliefs of fantasy false, (that all mass shootings are hoaxes of coarse) enrages him to the point where he can come up with ZERO credible LOGICAL points to argue the truth and his only escape is to say &quot;you&#39;re exposed&quot; due to his small mind not being able to comprehend how a mass shooter could possible pull the trigger on an innocent human being. One look at his history will show you just how off in space, (possibly mentally ill even) he really is, but what else would you expect from someone who thinks they&#39;re a God? And as it stands is one of the most consistently downvoted people you will see on Reddit. Now I&#39;m sure he may possibly have good intentions if he ever got off of YouTube and came back to reality and stopped believing everything his favorite dark basement &quot;Fake Blood&quot; YouTuber tells him, however at the end of the day.. bat shit crazy IS, bat shit crazy.

    <div class="md"><p>No, bad things definitely happen.  Though these contrived events to manipulate the American public are occurring with regular frequency now that Zionists control so many United States institutions.</p>

<p>Being a clear disinfo fool (once again, clear evidence can be viewed here - <a href="/u/-Money-">/u/-Money-</a>), your petty insults mean absolutely nothing and further your lack of credibility.  As this is all you have in your arsenal, you&#39;re quite easy to identify, and given the opportunity to debate facts, destroy.</p>

<p>I challenge your simple mind to explain how they the Eliott Rogers crime scene ws s NOT.manipulated to match the sha being pushed by the Zionist controlled media.  How a bicycle was able to be added to the crime scene after the fact.  Also explain how and why the exact crime scene was shut down just prior to the alleged attack by zeliott Rogers.</p>

<p>And most importantly, tell us how he was able to take a bullet to the hip and not bleed anywhere in his car.  And was then able to magically shoot himself in the head, and get absolutely no blood on the airbag or interrior of his car.  Identically to the fictional Adam Lanza and his bloodless head wound.</p>

<p>Being an obvious shill, that pesky physical evidence destroys any ability you may have to debate the facts and truth.  The challenge has been given, and I patiently await your ridiculous, evidenceless response void of any facts or truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. </p>

<p>From videos such as, &quot;The Ukraine invasion was a plot by Russia to steal from the pyramids that were recently found underground&quot; to his most recent gem, and allow me to paraphrase but it went something like.. &quot;Look at dem UFO ORBS jimmy, they imtelligiant creechuuuz, dey everywhuur! it&#39;z an invasiomin!!.&quot;</p>

<p>I mean how tacky do you have to be to use the term &quot;UFO ORBS&quot; when talking about UFO&#39;s in a serious manner to thousands of people lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since your vote rigging is promoting this 1 vote comment, I&#39;ll use it to show exactly why RPR is also being attacked.  It&#39;s great when our independent media is all that remains to share the truth.  Every news organization pushing the same lies that this event is somehow real..it&#39;s not.  Without further ado, the reason for the attack:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mass shootings are definitely staged to further the Israeli agenda on the United States.  The bike was not removed from the scene.  It was ADDED the following morning to promote the bullshit story they are forcing on us.  All fiction.  You touch on the shop illegally cleaning up the blood, a biohazard that requires a specialized and certified member to do in real life.  Also, the shell casing is what normal people would consider as &quot;evidence.&quot; Not something left behind by the police.  The glass being on-site also blows the roof off this fiction.  PRIOR to the shooting, the market already magically had the replacement glass.  So before the glass was even damaged in the shooting, the shop owners were wise enough, and could see the future, and knew they would need replacement glass.</p>

<p>And while I agree with you about Daboo7 calling everything a conspiracy is foolish, the Elliott Rogers scam is the proof that proves all of the other mass shootings were just as fictional.  You may want to perform some additional research, so you&#39;re not the only fool left to know the truth that this is made up to justify the destruction of the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>Elliot Rodgers was a sick fuck who was treated like a girl all of his life, never had sex, never had a meaningful relationship inside our outside of the home and decided to take it out on other innocent people, this mixed with the shit the therapist fed him and probably SSRI&#39;s totally sealed the deal, no more, no less. There are sick people in the world believe it or not, every single shooting EVERY. SINGLE. SHOOTING. someone says is an inside job and it&#39;s all because they watch all these retarded YouTube videos.. fake blood! fake everything! the bike moved! NO, the only fake shootings recently were Sandy Hook and James Holmes. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t make a shit load of videos on YouTube saying you&#39;re going to kill everyone when it&#39;s an inside job, they just fucking do it. Now days you can get the ATF at your door for the shit he did, and like he said in his manifesto about when the police showed up when he parents saw the videos, &quot;had they of searched my house I would have been stopped&quot; but you can&#39;t just search someone without a warrant over angry parents, so the sick fuck got away with what he had planned. This is a one man Columbine in 2014, crazy people do crazy things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what I thought TheGroxt1 chanenel was doing, now you wanna talk about ludicrous? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGroxt1">Here you go</a>, according to him he asked God to show him proof and he somehow found Google Earth and took it as a sign. I paraphrased a bit but that was pretty much it, and that God is telling him to look down from Google Earth and put the pieces together by finding faces and/or &quot;prophecies&quot; in the landscapes to prove the Illuminati, connections to Ancient Egypt, Nuclear Disasters, the list goes on.</p>

<p>One of his most favorite lines to use from the Bible involves the word &quot;IT&quot; he then takes this as the Bible is referring to this &quot;IT&quot; as being a demonic entity from hell or the Antichrist, and will find &quot;IT&quot; in the landscapes dressed as a clown usually. <em>&quot;Here we can see &#39;IT,&#39; which I talk about a lot, we can see him putting the pill in his mouth, symbolizing the great coming deception we&#39;re going to be fed by the powers that be.&quot;</em> </p>

<p>It sounds like I&#39;m joking but I didn&#39;t make any of that up, the guy is dead serious and he really said that and sadly, it&#39;s not the craziest thing he has said, FAR from it actually.</p>

<p>The REALLY sad part is, there are close to 30,000 people subscribed to him that buy it all, and he CAN make VERY convincing portraits and craft a lot of stuff together to make you say &quot;hmmm&quot; but once reality kicks you again you come back pretty quick so don&#39;t judge yourself if you get caught up in it, because like I said he&#39;s really good at what he crafts. </p>
