       A very Jewish news media in America vigorously bending over backwards to do everything it could to protect Israel from scrutiny, including, incredibly, omitting any mention of the 9-11 Commission Report's finding that it was U.S. support for Israeli atrocities committed upon Palestinians that inspired the attacks in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how about, the fact that Israel has committed false-flag attacks against America before, in Egypt (see Lavon Affair) and in international waters (see U.S.S. Liberty).  Or against our allies (see King David Hotel Bombing).
      </p>
      <p>
       And it goes on.  But you do actually have to bother yourself to look, and accept as a consequence of investigation that the facts may lead you to a conclusion that you don't want to reach.

      <p>
       When so many act in unison it is irresponsible not to make that connection.  In any case, zionist has been used, racist Jew, Jewish supremacist... every kind of effort has been made to more correctly identify that group within Jewry responsible for engaging in these conspiracies, and always with the result of being labelled anti-Semitic in any case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The correct solution here would be to speak truth to power and resolve these issues peacefully through dialogue.  Instead, a very Jewish news media works overtime at shutting down the conversation before it can even begin.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it really doesn't matter what word is being used here.  It is the expectation of Jew that Jew should be able to exercise power without ever hearing mention of same, and that is unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       You too will soon be made to see that.

       Of course, it's all circumstantial evidence, but you can go to the federal courthouse in Concord, New Hampshire and read it. It's captioned Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Superceding (sic) Indictment or for an Evidentiary Hearing or for Discovery Because of Vindictive and/or Selective Prosecution by the Government. It's all in the exhibits to that motion.

       I love that this person just keeps telling ppl to find out for themselves rather than just saying what their 'evidence'  is.  He broke laws,  got jailed and us complaining...  If this guy hadn't done anything wrong he wouldn't be jailed...  Although it seems impossible to get thia person to understand that.

       Isn't it enough that they've routinely done this before (see Lavon Affair, U.S.S. Liberty, King David Hotel Bombing) that we should be asking questions when evidence presents itself suggesting their complicity again?

       There is actually a great deal of evidence implicating Israel, and though it is true that there is more that we need to know, conjecture isn't the best word to use to describe it either, or at least, not if we're not going to use it to describe the case that has been made implicating "Muslim extremists" in this attack.

       We should have followed all of the evidence, and when you have, for instance, Mossad agents caught dancing and celebrating as the towers fell and Americans were being burned alive, you investigate that and put it together with all of the other evidence implicating Israel.

       I realized early on that many of Schiff's reasons would not hold up in court. But I continued to believe in his major reasons. But after I spoke with a Federal Defender after I was raided, he convinced me that none of Schiff's reasons were valid. So I recanted. Unfortunately, me saying that I am not guilty because I truly believed in what I was doing at the time, but now I don't believe it probably didn't look too good to the jury.

       That was painful to read. I don't think you ever deserved 6 years in prison - not over taxes. You didn't harm anybody, and at the same time your taxes would certainly be used to harm other people.

       I had read a lot of alternative media over the years and realized how thoroughly corrupt the gov't was. My "Try to do something about it" point was when I met Schiff as he was campaigning for President in N.H. and he convinced me the gov't was illegally collecting income taxes.

       I didn't go 9 years without paying; I got a 9 year sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you like to know how they arrived at 9 years? The gov't discovered that over a number of years, I had helped people file approximately 300 of Schiff's Zero Income Tax Returns. Many of them requested refunds, but very few ever received a refund.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law says that if a person requests a refund to which he or she is not entitled, that amount is considered a "loss" to the gov't. So they added up all of the requested refunds in those 300 returns and it came to about $3.3 million. So it was deemed that I defrauded the gov't of $3.3 million. So they looked on their chart for the punishment under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines--9 years in prison! Talk about Alice-in-Wondrland!

       If you had not used government infrastructure, been involved in the economy heavily supported and regulated by the US government, and so forth... I would agree with you. Anyone who lives off grid and supports themselves apart from the governed society, within a state, should have no obligation to pay taxes. It would seem you are not one of those individuals. Furthermore, I think it is still allowable to dissent against how your tax money is spent, but to expect the government to not come down on you when going against rules laid forth, is irrational. Which is why the cases that make it in the media are people who are heavily armed.

       But even then...  People are allowed different views, it doesn't matter where they came from.  They may well enjoy debating things...  Reading different opinions.  People are not always going to agree with ppl...  And sorry but particularly when someone comes in and says they were jailed because of blah but for blah,  which is a law I broke.  This is retarded.  Surely even you can see that.

       Maybe because it was clear that you were just trying to avoid paying taxes. You were paying monthly so you probably had a huge debt with them and tried to bullshit your way out of paying it. Thats probably why you didn't get coverage.

       No, I didn't get coverage because of my allegations about not all, but certain Jews. After I was raided, but before I went to trial, I also had a weekly Public Access Cable TV show called "New World Order Watch". I spoke a lot about the inordinate amount of power wielded by a relatively few people.

       You're just being really racist,  do you realise that?  Even if it turned out that your ideas were correct,  would you want to be looked at in a racist way simply because your 'kind'  did something bad?  What about all the wars America has fought in?  Does that make you as an America a bad person?

       I like conspiracies that have some sort of evidence to support them.  You have given zero evidence to support your claim that Israel was involved in 9/11 or that taxes are illegal.  If you were to present some evidence to support either these claims then I would consider them.  But, I am not going to just take your word for it.  I open to changing my mind but you need to present some kind of evidence or facts to support your claim.

       you're in the wrong place, bub. that's not how this works. sometimes, they're good at covering up the evidence. go subscribe to
       <a href="/r/actualconspiracies">
        /r/actualconspiracies

       instead. they have a huge dependence on stuff they can see/taste/hear.

       yeah, it's like asking evidence showing pro wrestling is fake. to some people (mainstream) they'll say it's real and we (conspiracy-people) have no evidence showing anything contrary. i mean how can the entire federation be lying to us? all those wrestlers are just conspiring to fake matches. nooo.
       <br/>
       but to people 'in the know' they don't need evidence pro wrestling's fake, they just know.
      </p>
      <p>
       evidence is great, but a lot of times, it has to go on speculation alone because the evidence has been covered up. but those that have been following these guys for a long time know their signs. and when we see a sign and talk about it, people who aren't in the know just see it as crazy talk, and now those 'not-in-the-know' people are the majority in this sub.

       you can say it's faith yeah. i have faith in those with power trying to gain more power. do you need evidence to see that?
      </p>
      <p>
       if you analyze history, you'll see that it repeats itself. how do you think hitler was able to convince people like you to kill the jews? it's the same way bush convinced you to support killing iraqi's.
      </p>
      <p>
       even when there was no evidence saying there were no WMD's, i knew there were no WMDs, but you'd have been like "there's no evidence he's lying, let's kill them muslims!"

       It's so difficult to explain this to the un-initiated. Go read tragedy and hope by carol quigly (clinton's mentor). It explains their plans right in there. The problem is most people can't read a 1000 page book, but since now i know you can, i'm ok with telling you to read it. It's not faith based, it's just the average person can't comprehend thousands of pages of literature so i just say that becuase i know they'll never read it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you get past that, read the stuff written by tavistock press on their plans for the coming centuries. It's a $16,000 collection though, so i doubt most people will buy it, but you can find bits and pieces online. This is why i don't have 'evidence' --how would i expect someone to read 20,000 pages of evidence? You'd have to read the whole thing to get the picture, so i just say faith-based because it's easier to understand.

       Tavistock Institute specializes in writing books for world leaders, exclusively. They analyze mass social behavior and make suggestions on how to mold it for a 'civilized' future society. Lots of one world government and globalization in there. They see it as helping us though, i don't think they think they're evil. They price the books really high and the books span tens of thousands of pages though, to keep them out of reach of the public. But it's all in there. They don't really 'hide' anything, and their societies aren't really 'secret'.

       dude, your brain just cannot handle it without years of learning. for example, if i told you to go to this site and tell you it's 'proof' of how the internet runs, you'd just be like 'that's crazy talk' because it simply looks alien to you. you need years of training, man. you think somehow a whole paradigm shift of thinking can be easily explained through a reddit post.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'll tell you what, if you can get 5 questions right on that site (9tut.com) without cheating, then i'll consider you worthy of teaching.

       If you can just go to this site (
       <a href="http://www.digitaltut.com/">
        http://www.digitaltut.com/
       </a>
       ), and answer 5 questions, I'll consider you smart enough for me to pass on information to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hey, double bonus is you can answer any of those questions, I know a lot of companies that'll hire you tomorrow for $90K.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm trying to show is the evidence to answer all those questions is available, and I can tell you every single bit of info about it. But it's just gonna seem alien to you. The reason I'm picking this is because it takes intelligence but it takes WAY less intelligence than understanding geopolitics. That being said, it's still gonna take you 6 months of learning just to make sense of anything on that site. Now, geopolitics will take 10 years, so if you can master that site, then, I can tell you 1/20th of the info to understand geopolitics. Does that make sense?

       What I'm trying to show you is that even with evidence and questions, you will be unable to make enough sense of the 'evidence' to answer the 'questions'
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is something A LOT of people can do. So, if you are unable to do something A LOT of people can do, how will you be able to understand something only A FEW people can do (like geopolitics).

      <p>
       Can you understand what it's like for me to get shit from dumb people all the time, feeling powerless knowing I can't explain anything to them because their brains are too small? Put yourself in my shoes for once.

       It's called a frame war, man. Or 'premise-war'
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were to say, 'well I think I'm such a genius because this this that' then I've already lost, because now i'm accepting your frame(premise) and arguing against it. This just derails from the real topic of how this whole thread works. Who cares why I think I'm a genius? I never said I was a genius, I just think you're severely closed minded. You know that buddhist saying 'you must empty the bucket to fill it (with new information).' Well, your bucket's all full of PhD Neuroscience and it's incapable of any new input. You just can't let go of the way you're used to understanding things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, you're not gonna be able to accept something as 'fact' unless it's in a nice little container, so stay out of this place. No one invited you or your friends. Yet you just keep coming back and annoying us. Find something better to do. This is going nowhere for the both of us but down, so let's stop it, maybe? We'll never agree in a million years.

       The problem is, you've been indoctrinated into a style of thinking the past 8 years of your life that can no longer be reversed. Your training is there to make you a good worker, not question authority. You suck authoritie's cock. That's why you keep asking me for some 'evidence' based of some authority. I can send you tons of stuff from non-authority sites (alternative media) that you'll just brush off 'cause it's not a scholarly publication or from the washington post or something.

       Well, just skip all training and go become and astronaut tomorrow. All you gotta do is find someone who can explain it simply. Fuck books and stuff, all you need is reddit memes--they're simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand your sentiment. And i can explain it simply, but that doesn't mean your brain is ready to accept it. Try and explain how to use a smartphone to an 80 year old lady. What's simple to you is magic to her.

       Your arrogance helps your point along completely. I now fully agree with you because my childish brain cannot comprehend what you are saying, ergo, it is factually correct.

       Sure. It's simple, everyone knows those in power like to keep their power. In the middle ages and before, families intermarried to preserve the powerful bloodlines--no one disputes this. Most people think these pharos/kings/queens just fell off the map when modern civilation came to be, but people don't just lose their power like that and die off.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened was they saw the people were beginning to outnumber them and they could no longer control them by force, so they decided to agree to get together and set up shadow goverments which they could control through finance.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1913, they took over america by causing a bank run through their influence in the media. They then offered a resolution to the panic they created by creating a central bank that was SEPARATE from any government (federal reserve). (You'll see a bunch of senators on youtube asking the leaders of the fed why gov't isn't allowed to audit them, and they just keep saying it needs to be independent for uh, reasons). So basically, through the control of the dollar, they can enact change with the push of a button.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every nation's central bank is owned by the same guys (except iraq, which is one of the reasons we invaded).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, TL:DR, kings/queens decided to control the world covertly through finance behind the scenes and never really lost their power.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my simple explanation. Much of it will seem absurd to the uninitiated.

       yeah, remember 10 years ago when there was no 'evidence' the NSA was spying on us? you would've been there saying the same thing. "guy's there's no evidence so it doesn't exist, derp derp derp. also OJ didn't kill his wife derp derp derp." when are you gonna learn it's easy to HIDE the evidence. are you saying if the evidence is hidden it doesn't exist? go to

       Yeah, so NOW you see the reality of the NSA situation since it's clear cut. But even when it was happening 10 years ago, in your mind, it didn't exist, right? Until someone tells you in a clear cut way the official 9/11 story is bogus, it won't exist for you either. So, one day when it doesn't matter anymore, you'll accept the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all fine, but this is a place for people that see beyond the limitation of what's released to the public, so you and others like you that need a clear cut thing should stick to

       . All their stuff is based off mainstream ny times and washington post stuff. No alternative news sources there.    I'm not sure why you're here if you disagree with everything. You wouldn't go to a nickelback concert just to talk shit about nickelback, would you? Then stay out of this sub!

       can you stop replying to me? you're obviously left over from the crosspost in
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       yesterday. i had to deal with 100s of you yesterday and i just wanna get back to the way things were. you wouldn't want the guys from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       spamming your sub would you? no! it sucks, and i just don't wanna do it after i did it for like 12 hours yesterday and got super downvoted all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       plus, you're a dumb sports guy. how would you even comprehend that much reading? aren't you all based joining the group of people you were born around and yelling at the other groups? your consciousness is way to low and discipline way too lacking for an endeavor such as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       just leave me alone and go back to yelling at groups outside your geographic area. that's what you sports guys do best.
      </p>
      <p>
       OH! that's why you're doing this. i just realized! you're thinking of this in terms of teams!
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       vs.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       listen, you'll never like a team outside your geographic area, so how can you possibly comprehend something that's on such a higher level than just grunting and eating hot dogs and all that shit associated with dumb sports people talk?
      </p>
      <p>
       you can continue, but i can't have an intelligent conversation with a sports guy. you just side with your team and dislike other teams, and that's the extent of your decision making skills.

       It's NOT secret knowledge! A lot of world leaders read this in college, but you gotta go to Harvard or Oxford to have access to these books. And you need the entire understanding of all the books. A few excerpts won't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, they wouldn't let you operate on a human until you finished all of med school, right? Be like "I read a few excerpts and watched scrubs--I'm ready to perform open heart surgery now"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I don't usually post my source of evidence. Most people can't comprehend someone can read that much.

       there's no winning with you guys. you ask for evidence, so i reluctantly post it, knowing i'll get retard-isms. then you say "durr, i can't read that much. can you just tell me if it's a good thing or a bad thing, like CNN?"
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm telling you, you guys need someone on TV to just tell you what to think, and have an inability to put a lot of ideas together to make your own opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, this is all due to cross traffic from
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       and will be over by tomorrow anyway. i usually stay out of your sub because of this kind of stuff. hopefully, we can part ways soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       in order to understand, you need a new way of thinking. i'm not gonna be able to undo your years of reading excerpts and teach you the discipline necessary to go through these texts.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's NOT a hidden conspiracy! it's out in the open, but like you said, it's inaccessible to retards.

       If you believe it so much show proof, show one shred of evidence or one competent person that isn't mentally ill that agrees with you. Why are you so hung up on being right? Do you have some secret information no one has? Because that is a symptom of schizophrenia.  I believe in things that are possible. Data collection of this degree wasn't possible twenty years ago, today it is a reality. I believe in reality because I have common sense.

       Ive actually had an account and posted here for years but delete my accounts periodically.  Just because you seem to think you have some sort of wisdom doesnt ever make you right. In fact you act like a fool who can't see anything other than what the puppet masters want him to see. A simply peon, a drone created through such heavy consumption of propaganda you have actually internalized it so much you cant even see the truth if it shit on your chest.

       At least for me, it's because I genuinely do enjoy conspiracy theories, but most of them on here are just terrible. If you cry wolf enough times, no one starts to believe you. I just think that this place, and every other conspiracy forum out there are wasting their time and making it less likely that real conspiracies will be uncovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need solid methodology to demarcate the terrible conspiracy theories from genuine ones if the average person is going to take conspiracy theories seriously.

       Two things: you're not a whistleblower. You're a researcher but not an insider. You did not expose the wrong doings of an organisation you were a part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no clear connection between your 9/11 related activities and your legal troubles. You have given yourself more than enough rope by other means: you refused to pay back taxes owed and you engaged in activities to promote not paying taxes. The act of not settling outstanding taxes was enough for you to be

       What about the fact that after I was raided, Schiff spent many months continuing what he had been doing all along, i.e., nightly radio programs, seminars, an active website, an active office in Las Vegas, etc.? What about the fact that one of the top dual loyalists to Israel in our defense department's brother was the head of the criminal division of the state in which I lived?

       There was more than enough to put you away already without there needing to be a conspiracy to harm you in particular. You drew attention to yourself by refusing to pay outstanding debts, and you flaunted your unwillingness to pay taxes in the future.
      </p>

       So, unless you have clear evidence to the contrary, the simplest explanation is that you were caught by a bureaucracy dedicated to catching such things.

       Don't you think that it's a little odd for someone to be targeted by the Justice Department (which is country-wide) for being a promoter of Irwin Schiff's arguments, but Irwin Schiff himself was not targeted for about a year or so?
      </p>
      <p>
       Schiff got a lot of extra time added on for being so belligerent to the judge which he was representing himself at trial.

       I think what that suggests is that why you were imprisoned had nothing to do with your connection to him, but rather outside lawbreaking. Did you happen to break any other laws that could've got you in trouble that the court mentioned?

       How did it feel in 2004 when Shiff pleaded not guilty to willful income tax evasion on the basis that he had "diminished capacity" due to his suffering from of "chronic sever delusional personality disorder"? How did it feel to have what looks to be your hero admit that his beliefs, and subsequently yours, stem from an ongoing mental illness?

       Which travesty? The one where you decided you get to to not pay taxes? Or the one where you get a 9 year prison term and you still don't get it? This has nothing to do with 9/11 and everything to do with being an Irwin Schiff follower. Sure you got arrested first, but all that means is you got on someone's radar first. People say a lot more damning things about 9/11 than you.

       Criminal-defense lawyer here with experience at both trial and appellate levels.  With due respect, this is a really, really simple court case.  Federal law requires you to pay taxes.  You willfully prepared false tax returns: based on the Code, you owed some amount of money, but said you owed nothing.  Federal tax returns aren't asking for your opinion, they're asking you to tell them what amount of money you owe them based on the tax code, which isn't a negotiable set of rules.  Because you thought it was okay to just say "well, I don't think taxes should exist, and here's why" has absolutely nothing to do with anything; it's just not relevant, because ignorance of the law isn't a defense.  (EDIT: Sometimes ignorance is a defense, like if it makes impossible the mental state required.  Here, though, it's not relevant.  See discussion below.)  The law is that you have to pay taxes.  You disagree with it.  Unfortunately, you don't decide the law, the Court does, and has--many, many times--and we have to pay taxes.  Sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the entire story you tell boils down to "I did everything they accused me of, I admitted it in open court, and then I got convicted."  This argument is the equivalent of "I think people should be able to possess heroin, so I had a pound of heroin in my car.  I went into court and argued that I should be able to have as much heroin as I want, but they just pointed to the statute and convicted me anyway, and I think that's really unfair."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see any grounds for a motion to dismiss, and I don't see any grounds for appeal, at least not based on the information you've laid out.  Without getting into the legal tests, there's nothing close to selective/vindictive prosecution here, even if every single thing you say is true.  Let me reiterate: you could be right about everything, up to and including the government's desire to suppress your statements, and you
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       would not have had a viable appellate claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, the most promising legal issue in your situation would be suing Irwin Schiff for convincing you to behave in a way that he knew or should have known would result in you violating Federal law.  He led you astray, and that's a damn shame.  I'm sorry you had to go through such a difficult time because of the selfishness, ignorance, and greed of a prominent public figure, and I hope you find some peace moving forward.  Best of luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. I'd imagine this won't be received with open arms, and I understand if it's not something you want to hear--or something that others on this sub want to read--but really, this is an open-and-shut situation.  I'm really sorry this happened to you, it sounds like you got taken in by a pretty convincing con man.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Disagreement with the law isn't a defense to conviction.

       I was charged with filing and preparing tax returns for myself and for other WHICH I KNEW AND BELIEVED TO BE FALSE. My defense was, I didn't believe that they were false and I had spent the previous almost 5 years promoting Schiff's information. The prosecutors argued that I willfully blinded myself to the law.

       I can see how you'd have trouble with that.  The problem is, that's not the language.  The language at issue is "willfully filed," which, yes, in many circumstances means "knew and believed to be false."  Unfortunately, the
       <em>
        reason
       </em>
       you didn't believe them to be false isn't one you're allowed to argue, as clearly explained by the Court of Appeals:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A willful violation is a voluntary, intentional relinquishment of a known legal duty.
        <em>

        , 498 U.S. 192 (1991). An error arising from a bona fide misunderstanding of the Tax Code is not willful, but an error arising from a constitutional or philosophical objection is willful.
        <em>
         Cheek
        </em>
        , 498 U.S. at 205-206. The appellant argues that he sincerely believed that the Tax Code was unconstitutional. This is just the sort of argument that Cheek precludes.

       If we're not in a court of law, you can make the argument you're making.  It's not a bad argument.  It's a good enough one that somebody argued it in front of the Supreme Court in
       <em>
        Cheek
       </em>
       , and somebody else kept trying in
       <em>
        Bonneau
       </em>
       .  Unfortunately, though, the Court ruled against your argument, and because there is direct, binding authority, the answer is clear: philosophical objections, no matter how honestly held, do not counter the requirement of willfullness.

       But ours weren't constitutional or philosophical objections. We argued that there was no explicit law making a person "liable" because the word "liable" was not used in the statute. If my position was because of an incorrect interpretation of the law, then Cheek would have allowed me to be acquitted. Quite a number of people have been acquitted using Cheek.

       I see where you're coming from on this, but the problem is that
       <em>
        United States v. Bonneau
       </em>
       , 970 F.2d 929 (1st Cir. 1992) dealt with what seems to be an identical situation: based on his interpretations of the code, including some definitional issues like yours (he didn't believe that "wages" included "income," for example, based on the wording), he decided not to pay taxes.  In
       <em>
        Bonneau
       </em>
       , when faced with precisely the situation of "an incorrect interpretation of the law," the First Circuit--also binding authority, since you're up that way--stated:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At trial Bonneau did not dispute that he owed taxes for both of the calendar years in question or that he took steps to prevent taxes from being withheld or paid, but he did deny that his actions were willful. Under Cheek v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 604, 610-11, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991), the willfulness element of the crime charged can in some circumstances be defeated where a taxpayer wrongly but sincerely believed that no tax was due. Cheek holds, however, that while a misunderstanding of the tax laws may negate willfulness, the taxpayer's views about the validity of the tax statutes are not relevant to willfulness. Id. 111 S.Ct. at 613.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/ca1/41Es/united-states-v-paul-b-bonneau/">
        Bonneau para. 5
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't misunderstand them, it seems.  You believed that, because of how they were worded, they didn't actually exist.  If the beliefs you honestly held applied to everybody, nobody would have to pay taxes to the government.  That's functionally identical to "doesn't believe that the tax statute is valid," which
       <em>
        Bonneau
       </em>
       dealt with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's almost impossible to reasonably argue that your view was nothing more than an "incorrect interpretation of the law" based on the word "liable," when 99.99999999999% of people are paying taxes irrespective of the precise word used.  There is, of necessity, a philosophical/moral aspect to your claim.  If there weren't, you'd have just paid the taxes anyway, since you knew that's what the government expects you and everyone else to do, and what almost everyone else in the country is doing.  Trying to legitimate those philosophical objections through technicalities doesn't mean that you really, honestly thought that the government didn't expect you pay any taxes, which would approach the kind of misinterpretation
       <em>
        Cheek
       </em>
       allows.  Anyway, we're getting to the point where I'm going to need to pull up WestLaw, and it's not really relevant anyway, since it's all over and done with.  All I can say is that I'm sorry you had to go through that entire ordeal, and I wish you nothing but the best in the future.

       One of the things that most people don't realize is how tenaciously good Schiff was at convincing people that he was correct, that the gov't was collecting taxes illegally, and that any true patriot should do his or her patriotic duty and refuse to acquiesce to the gov't illegal collection.

       He's not the one facing 9 years in federal prison. You sound like the stupid one when you thought the government was gonna let you prove that you didn't have to pay any taxes. Even if you were actually technically correct, guess what, that doesn't matter. Taxes are collected to support our modern society and it is not in society and the government's benefit to  allow you to not pay any. Just because you find some kind of legal loophole does not mean the government is going to look upon your actions favorably, and they clearly didn't in this case.

       In the beginning, the gov't offered me a deal. Part of it included me testifying against Irwin Schiff. My response: "Mr. Schiff isn't trying to hide anything. You can listen to his 2- (sometimes 3-) hour radio priogram every weeknight; you can visit him at his highly-visible office in Las Vegas, you can attend one of his seminars; you can go to his website; etc. What could I possibly help you with that you couldn't just go an ask him yourself?" Nothing!

       section about it, but I think Hawk was talking more about immunity laws.  For example, let's say that a Supreme Court case comes down saying that it's illegal to search a suspect's cell phone without a warrant.  Joe Cop does just that before he hears about the ruling, thinking that doing so isn't a violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Because he had a good-faith belief that his actions were constitutional, it's not actionable.

       It's not as simple as that. Qualified immunity is a exception to culpability that is carved out specifically for police officers/state actors (these are people who are supposed to have
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       understanding of the law, and yet are given more leeway to violate it). The same "reasonable" standards rarely apply to civilians. It's an unreasonable dichotomy.

      <p>
       That said, here is a Supreme Court ruling that held ignorance of the law to be a valid defense in certain situations:

       Believe me, man, you're preaching to the choir.   There's dicta in some Fourth Amendment case, maybe
       <em>
        Segura
       </em>
       , that says, essentially, "well, part of the reason we're not going to let you suppress the evidence from this ridiculously unconstitutional behavior is that you can sue them in civil court and get compensation."  Which is obviously the most ridiculous thing ever, but there it is.  Anyway, I'm not disagreeing with you about the general principle.  I just don't think it helps OP out at all.

       You're absolutely correct that ignorance can be a defense, even in criminal law at times.  I shouldn't have made that broad of a statement, as opposed to specifying that given the facts as OP described them, mistake/ignorance isn't relevant to his case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Model Penal Code--which obviously isn't binding, but is a useful summary of the general principles--specifies that "a belief that conduct does not legally constitute an offense is a defense to prosecution" when:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (a) the statute or other enactment defining the offense is not known to the actor and has not been published or otherwise reasonably made available prior to the conduct alleged; or
       </p>
       <p>
        (b) he acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous, contained in (i) a statute or other enactment; (ii) a judicial decision, opinion or judgment; (iii) an administrative order or grant of permission; or (iv) an official interpretation of the public officer or body charged by law with responsibility for the interpretation, administration or enforcement of the law defining the offense.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In other words, his erroneous belief doesn't constitute a defense.  If you can find me some authority to the contrary, that'd be great, and I'm sure OP would appreciate it as well.  Otherwise, though, I think we're back where we're started: although sometimes ignorance can be a defense, considering the facts of OP's case, it's not relevant here.  Thanks for pointing out the misstatement of law, though, because I agree that it's important to be accurate about these things.

       Glad you edited that phrase. That's all I was concerned about really, not so much this particular case. I didn't mean to sound like an ass, I edited my comment.

       I didn't read any of the legal documents pertaining to this though, so I would not be able to comment on OP other than he seems to think it hinges on the word
       <em>
        willful
       </em>
       and that makes sense to me.

       I don't know if he plead out, if it was a jury trial, whatever - if he had a different lawyer, a different judge, different jury, things might not be the same right now.

       Our legal system is in a terrible mess, that's the only thing I'm sure of.

       It's cool, if I'm going to make sloppy overgeneralizations because I don't have my lawyer hat on all the way, I'm happy to be called out on them.  No offense taken.  It was apparently a jury trial, representing
       <em>
        pro se
       </em>
       .  If you look at another comment, the court of appeals actually cited direct precedent that says philosophical objections/belief that something's unconstitutional don't counter willfulness, no matter how honestly they're held.  That's why he lost.  Well, that and he's a
       <em>
        pro se
       </em>
       litigant against a federal prosecutor.  Even so, there's not a lawyer in the country who could've won this case for him, I don't think.

       You weren't the only one, sir. Point is you were a tax evader and you paid the price. I'm not saying I don't agree with you - the 13th amendment wasn't ever even ratified - but you took a risk and lost.

       I totally understand where you were coming from, and I didn't pay taxes for a few years as well. But unfortunately they took my bank account, emptied it, and sent me a receipt. Point is, let's separate the two things here. You chose to protest illegal taxation without apportionment, and you spoke out about 9/11. Speaking out about 9/11 might have put you on some radars, but being a "tax evader" is what got you locked up. there's a lesson to be learned here, however:

       The conspiracy is that I openly and notoriously promoted Schiff's agenda for almost 5 years with no repercussions from the Justice Department. But when I began alleging that Israelis and other dual loyalists to both Israel and the U.S. in our own gov't were complicit in the 9-11 attacks as a means to bolster the U.S.'s presence in the Middle East for Israel's benefit, they came down upon me like a ton of bricks!

       Ignorance of the law is not tantamount to the law not applying to you. If you don't know what the fuck you're doing when it comes to tax law, how about not filing 300 returns as if they had no income.

       We believed that we knew the true history, scope, and legal intent of federal income taxation. You must realize that we were not filing tax returns in hope of them simply sliding through the system; we were overtly challenging the gov't's legal authority to collect them. We were attempting to make a point and make as many other people as possible aware of our beliefs.

       You're going in circles. You are either an idiot for thinking this and passing it on to hundreds of tax filings as if it were fact, or you're an idiot for thinking that challenging the government's right to tax you is not considered willful.

       Well, it wasn't.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushaber_v._Union_Pacific_Railroad">
        That was settled by the SCOTUS in 1916.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But the basic premise of the argument is that in a number of states, the exact text of the amendment that was ratified by the state legislatures had small variations in capitalization or punctuation, differing from the exact text proposed by Congress (no distinctions of substance, though), and that those variations meant the ratification process was invalid. As is often the case,

       Could you explain what you think that case says? I'm not seeing any part of the holding that says that the 16th amendment wasn't valid.

       The essential holding of the case was that the 16th amendment removed the constitution's previous requirement that any direct tax be apportioned, which paved the way for modern income taxation (and meant that the 1913 Revenue Act was legal).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what you mean by your second statement; I didn't say that any part of that case said that the 16th amendment was
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       valid, but rather the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Rereading my comment, perhaps your confusion comes from my response to 1sagas1's question - I could see how you could read "it wasn't" to be a response to his statement "it was ratified" rather than to his question "how was it improperly ratified". I have edited for clarity.

       Schiff's and his followers didn't use the "unconstitutional" argument. We argued that it would be unconstitutional if it were mandatory, but it wasn't mandatory. Schiff reasoned that the tax laws state that a person only has to pay taxes for which he is "liable".
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many federal taxes, and each one has a statute expressly using the word "liable". Except for the income tax. It doesn't use the word "liable" so Schiff argued that it wasn't mandatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Schiff didn't realize is that the courts are not that precise. If there is a statute which states something which means the same thing as being liable (which there is), then people are liable for that tax.

       I learned my lesson about challenging the federal income tax using Schiff's reasons. But I did come up with one of my own. I tried to promote it with a petition drive, but that was before I went to prison. I'm just trying to get back on my feet, now.
      </p>
      <p>
       My reason that the FIT is illegal is because, there is mucho testimiony in the Congressional Record when the 16th Amendment was being debated (and earlier) that it was only to be a tax on the wealthy (subsequent to the Industrial Revolution). And in the beginning, it was only a tax on the wealthy. However, over time, it morphed into a tax on virtually everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument is, if it was only supposed to be on the wealthy, then it should remain only a tax on the wealthy.

       The IRS and its income tax are illegal, the Constitutional amendment for the tax was never lawfully passed and resistance to unjust laws is the greatest obedience to the Law and its been shown millions of times that Israeli agents were involved in 9/11. The shills who say otherwise are moronic fools and will collapse under the force of history.

       The IRS executes its power through the rule of force, not by the rule of law.

       Yeah this sub got taken over by anti-gay bashers. (I say anti-gay bashers because people who don't like how we think subscribe to this sub to change us). I don't know why it bothers them so much to the point they need to spend their time telling us what we're thinking is wrong. Why don't they bash some homo's instead? I mean they're not being heterosexual so you need to subscribe to
       <a href="/r/gay">

       finally! someone admits there's the type of person that does this! you go into other people's subs and lurk while thinking up ways in how they're stupid/deluded and what not.
      </p>
      <p>
       i was wondering what the motivation was. you need to convince others of something to feel more comfortable in yourself. makes so much sense now. exactly what homophobes do to gay people.
      </p>
      <p>
       the question, is why do what others do affect you? the same reason those christians can't stand gay marriage -- they must control other's thoughts to suppress insecurities in themselves.

       Not exactly. I grew up enjoying reading about conspiracy theories, but as I've gotten older, I can read between the lines. A fair amount of the theories are just rooted in political ideology and bigoted hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only argue with ones that I have ironclad scientific knowledge to refute, it's very different from someone berating and shaming someone out of some moral ideology derived from a religious text. I don't disparage the person, I present logical counterarguments based in science when I feel qualified enough to do so.

       Yeah well what scientific proof was there of the NSA intercepting all internet data 10 years ago? None! You'd have called those people a crackpot. You'd be limited by information available to the public. But you know what? It was rampant regardless of public knowledge. Only me and others like us knew it to be fact at the time. History's repeating itself now. And I'm getting the same shit from you as i got 10 years ago.

       The thing is, you didn't know it to be fact. I think most people, myself included, knew that something was going on, but without proof, one cannot say definitely what is true without being disingenuous. Look into my comment history for r/conspiracy, I don't berate people or insult their intelligence. I pick very specific arguments that I have an educational background in, and provide a counterargument.

       See, I was encrypting all my data and using proxy ssl tunnels since I knew 10 years ago, while all your people's personal data is now on NSA servers because you waited for NBC/CNN to validate the claim. I just realized I have to wait 'till something is common knowledge before discussing it with you. I'm out.

       NSA stuff is not conspiracy stuff. that's as mainstream as it gets.

       anyway this sub has been infiltrated by you guys 'cause you guys can't stand us thinking this so much to the point you have to subscribe to it.

       until snowden says something, you'll be too afraid to think it. let me tell you, 5 years ago, i stated the same thing and people like you said the same thing "one agency sniffing all internet traffic is absurd!" all you can really do is believe what the mainstream media says. so weak minded.

       There was more than enough to put you away already without there needing to be a conspiracy to harm you in particular. You drew attention to yourself by refusing to pay outstanding debts, and you flaunted your unwillingness to pay taxes in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, unless you have clear evidence to the contrary, the simplest explanation is that you were caught by a bureaucracy dedicated to catching such things.
