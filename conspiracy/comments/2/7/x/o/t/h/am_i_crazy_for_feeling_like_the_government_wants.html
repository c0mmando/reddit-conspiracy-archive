        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just watched a news story about another school shooting in Oregon.
The story concluded, and the next story immediately flashed a picture of someone a firing machine gun, men with bazookas, and someone taking a picture of some action. They showed the Iraqi insurgency’s path with an animated arrow on a map, and as it went through tikrit, “saddam husseins home town” they said as a picture of saddam flashes across the screen. </p>

<p>Is it crazy to think that the government wants to disarm us? Show a story of a school shooting, followed by something that militarizes some peoples&#39; mindsets, hoping to facilitate more shootings in different ways (this news story being one of them) so that the do-gooders lobby against guns and we disarm ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s crazy at all and there&#39;s plenty of evidence to support the theory. The higher ups are probably smart enough to know that forced mass confiscation would lead to resistance which would lead to incarcerations, civil unrest and much more. Too many people have too many guns for them to effectively start rounding them up without having to actually go to war with a faction of American people.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve seen enough examples however (MADD, anti smoking groups, etc) to know that small grassroots movements can end in tremendous policy changes. Drunk driving didn&#39;t carry heavy penalties until MADD started making every mom terrified her kid going outside meant a death sentence by a drunk driver. Smoking in restaurants was legal until citizen action groups lobbied against it. A lot of drugs were legal until they were demonized in the 20th century and citizens demanded legal changes and gave the government more power.</p>

<p>The idea is similar to those. By showing these grisly stories on repeat (and perhaps even creating some of them) perhaps they&#39;re trying to send the message &quot;Moms and dads! Vote for gun control or your kid may be shot next!&quot; More sensible people and gun rights supporters won&#39;t pay much heed to the underlying message, but the terrified masses will grow more and more fearful and fear makes for illogical and irrational decisions. They&#39;ll start by whittling down, get some citizen action groups etc who lobby for law changes and they&#39;ll do it state by state until finally there are few enough gun rights supporters that regular police action can roundup most of the holdouts.</p>

<p>It is crazy to think otherwise. Hell, obama recently praised australias strict gun laws they recently passed, resulting in a huge confiscation. Obama has pubkicly stated that he is on board with that type of idea. </p>

<p>That is literally what he wsnts and he is not hiding it. He has admitted that he (as well as many other politicians) want americans to be disarmed. </p>

<p>They are proposing various amounts of legislations, one of which would make <strong>ALL</strong> automatic and semi-automatic weapons illegal. Yes, even that little .22 caliber rifle we got as a twelve year old for target shooting. Becausez you know, they are so dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gov&#39;t police state doesn&#39;t want to disarm the public because it would eliminate one of its reasons to exist. On the contrary, they want the problem of public shootings to get worse so they can offer the solution...a worldwide totalitarian police state. Mark my words, soon a &quot;solution&quot; will be offered that involves open surveillance of people in their homes. We&#39;re already under surveillance in our workplaces and public areas.</p>
