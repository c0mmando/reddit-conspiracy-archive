    <div class="md"><p>the most suspicious aspect of it all really, on top of the perfect photo format for data mining, is the synchronization at which the term and the trend appeared on worldwide media and further on got pushed. I agree it&#39;s not much but i&#39;ve seen this synchronization in the past, Iraq, Syria, etc... it was premeditated then, so i think there is no reason not to suspect this isn&#39;t too, they are definitely capable of such behaviors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, but I think causality is backwards on this one. A &quot;selfie&quot; has been a concept since the early 2000s, pretty much since phones had a reliable camera and could send it/download it. I&#39;d say any surveillance or datamining arose as an exploit of an obviously popular and growing medium, not that they created it as databait. Makes more sense to take advantage of the tools provided by the world than to make them yourself, start a secret hype campaign, etc. Cant speak to vine and Twitter,  but cameras on phones was always going to happen and humans are vain as hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your right in some aspects. People been taking pictures of themselves since the invention of the camera. However, once NSA got their facial recognition software. Selfies was pushed by Hollywood and media media in general. The self centered, superficial zombies ate it up. </p>

<p>The scary question is, why are the feds so interested in getting everyones face into a database. I think it is just a piece to a puzzle of a big picture. That picture looks very similar 1930&#39;s Germany. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heartily disagree.</p>

<p>They have had the ability to collect these photos if they wished since 2001 at least.</p>

<p>People weren&#39;t capable of instantly uploading selfies near instantaneously to the internet though.</p>

<p>Now we are, so what&#39;s the easiest way for the NSA to retain your current face for facial identity recognition software? Your selfies.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they collect the data? Their encryption and compression methods are ridiculous as are their image analysis algorithms, and I&#39;m sure their data collection software has an advanced upload filter as well so they don&#39;t waste time and space with too many files.</p>

<p>This is 2014, why on earth would you EVER underestimate the technological capabilities of entities which have been doing what they do since the 1950s? Honestly, you really have to be either stupid or blindingly ignorant to underestimate their breadth and scope of their activities and capabilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya it&#39;s weird how that word exploded into the public consciousness in the last months. It&#39;s like even reputable news-networks forgot the term &quot;self-portrait.&quot; Pop-songs, presidential selfies, it is a little much. </p>

<p>Selfies still make more sense to me than the explosion of Twitter. I was sure it was going to be a fad, but before you knew it every celebrity, show and product had a twitter address. The only truly unique thing about twitter is its inherent limitations.</p>

<p>My theory is that 180 characters is about the upper limit on the NSA&#39;s chatter analysis software, but you know, it&#39;s just a theory.</p>

<p>We know the DoD created a twitter service for Cuba to foment insurrection and monitor the mood of the population. They took great care to start slow, to make it look like the site&#39;s popularity was growing organically.</p>

<p>Vine got popular crazy fast too and like Twitter its defining feature is a limitation on the amount of data you can post at once. Having trouble sifting through all those eons of Youtube videos and millions of pages of blogposts, Five-Eyes?</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m just getting old and out of touch. Those services are genuinely popular with the kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>180 characters was/is the extra space that was available on the fiber line.  It allowed very small packets to have priority and an twitter fit itself into this space.  I&#39;m not sure if it was by design that there was this extra space or if it is simply how the hardware and protocols matched up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting. </p>

<p>If Twitter&#39;s character limit has no nefarious origin, it still doesn&#39;t really disprove my theory. (It&#39;s just an idea not a belief.) </p>

<p>They could have just selected Twitter for popularity, because They saw some value in it. I mean the five hundredth time you hear &quot;follow us on twitter!&quot; you might actually decide to give it a shot.</p>

<p>It could be a flaw in my perception but unlike Facebook, where average young people were the early adopters, instead it appeared that corporations and mainstream media were the first people to jump on the twitter boat and promote it hard. I must have heard the word a thousand times before I heard a real person say it.</p>

<p>Just remember, sometimes your more anonymous by being in the crowd. Lone wolves are easy to spot if your looking.

    <div class="md"><p>I knew someone who had an MFA thesis on this back in 2009. </p>

<p>His thesis was that digital cameras allow for selfies, and made Salford popular, because they don&#39;t use film and allow for the chance to re-take pictures. You are no longer constructed by film and can adjust to get the shot you want. The ubiquity of camera phones also made pictures cheap. With film cameras no one took pictures of their food, or half the crap people take photos of now, because it wasn&#39;t worth it. </p>

<p>Now I can take literally 3,000 photos for free if I want, and never pay for processing just to see the results. Which means no one cares to have a nice picture of themselves somewhere. They&#39;re fine to have their face blobbing up a photo of something worthy of taking a picture. Add a sprinkle of vanity, and the trend catches on not as what a lonely people do when no one else is around to take their photo, but what attention-seeking idiots do ironically. Once people copy that because the practice becomes popular you have things like grandparents taking them. So now they&#39;re no longer cool, and articles online are urging people to stop taking them once the White House starting using then as standard media fare.</p>

<p>So... Maybe that helps explain things. I personally think this might be putting the cart before the horse. The government is surely taking advantage of the trend to get a database put together, but making it popular would be much more difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many possible explanations. One I haven&#39;t seen here yet is loneliness. In the past you&#39;d ask  a friend to take a picture of you. Nowadays, people take pictures of themselves because they either have no friends around to do it for them (if they are the only one in the frame), or don&#39;t want to ask a stranger to help them. And that&#39;s sad, really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. First off because there was a massive amount of picture distribution online not only before selfies were as popular as they are but also before the NSA started this program.
Also, the main factor to the rise of selfies would be the simplicity and universality of the portable digital camera and the rise of the social media profile which, to some degree, necessitates a portrait of the user. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I acquired a budget digital Sony camcorder which is about 5 years old and was intrigued by its face detection facility. Here is a good concise description of this technology:</p>

<p><a href="http://camcorders.about.com/od/camcorders101/p/understandingfd.htm">http://camcorders.about.com/od/camcorders101/p/understandingfd.htm</a></p>

<p>&quot;When a camcorder is in autofocus mode, it will focus on whatever object is at the center of the frame – be it a tree, a rock, or your child. With face detection, the camcorder will skip the trees and automatically focus on a face (or faces), regardless of where it is. You’ll notice face detection at work on your camcorder’s LCD screen. The subject will appear with a box framing his or her face. &quot;</p>

<p>This auto-focus/face detection mode is the default setting. Why this obsession with in-focus faces I wondered? The same is true of phone cameras--autofocus facial detection is the default in most cases..</p>

<p>Then came the Snowden revelations and the NSA-GCHQ and law enforcement&#39;s obssession with bulk surveillance and its use of facial recognition software for mining it. This, I think, explains the obssession with sharply focussed faces in camcorders and smartphone cameras.</p>

<p>Given that many users of budget camcorders and smartphone cameras upload their movies to YouTube and social media sites, it is easy to guess why intel agencies would want to persuade camera manufacturers to introduce this face detection technology.</p>

<p>I think it is interesting also that the most popular social networking site is called Facebook. Remember every time you tag someone&#39;s face on social media you are doing the snoopers&#39; job for them.</p>

<p>My advice is to turn off autofocus/facial detection and manually focus on what YOU want to be sharp and clear in the picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like taking pictures of themselves. Smart phones and the internet have made it easy to take one and upload it. Social media like Facebook and Instagram make it easy to disseminate these photos. Blogs have to fill space so they cover trivial shit like selfies. </p>

<p>The effect is that, yes, people are far easier to track now on the internet, which is great for intelligence agencies and data mining services. They all benefit, which is why they absolutely work closely with social media sites to collect content. </p>

<p>It&#39;s perfectly logical why people take selfies and share them. The media, intelligence and law enforcement agencies, PR firms, marketing companies, etc all take advantage, but they didn&#39;t cause it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how I see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not research this is just a white mans opinion.  I remember disposable cameras to be the shit.  Take 28-32 photos, go to photo store, get them printed.  Now we have phones that we can carry everywhere, and boosted them with a camera feature as well.  To top it off, those things aren&#39;t disposable, and its not far-fetched to think people would not hand these 100$+ items to strangers and kindly ask for a photo.</p>

<p>The idea of easy photos is probably just humans being... human.  But this is just gold in a basket for anyone with a decent degree in computers and an interest in datamining. </p>
