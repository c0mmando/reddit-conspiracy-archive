I hear that the moon is nice this time of year. You will need this to get there though. </p>

<p>Nullify their money and crowd source a new public accounting ledger. </p>

<p>If we want to have electronic democracy, we need electronic money in the hands of the people. Every small business you go to, ask if they accept crypto currencies. </p>

<p>And if the system works to track money, it sure as hell should be able to be used to faithfully record votes. </p>

<p>We have to succeed. If they cannot pay the guards money that is worth anything, then the secrets and corruptions lose their protection. </p>

<p>99 to 1 or 20 to 1... Those odds are overpowering when Fiat turns to ash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have different priorities and will still vote differently, this will lead to compounding resentment by a group of the consistent losers and eventually they won&#39;t want to take it anymore so direct democracy descends into a circle jerk that excludes more and more people until it is once again a small group of people (and their hangerons) making the decisions to the gratification of the crowd that hasn&#39;t been trained to speak up for itself before. </p>

<p>These people will be the professional politician class who are the problem now, making the entire experiment kind of pointless from an impartial anarchist point of view. </p>

<p>There are also severe drawbacks to this form of government, beside the eventual marginalization of the losing individuals (who didn&#39;t feel marginalized because they were a part of a larger political party). Namely that if we use information technology to improve democracy it&#39;s still going to be vulnerable to attack by people who know the technology. So political fraudsters will be targeting IT professionals instead of voters or politicians themselves; Everyone has a price and the IT professionals who are the entrusted guardians of the direct democracy will be casualties to the hubris of society. They&#39;ll take the money of the backroom dealers and rigg elections with a hope they don&#39;t get caught, because if they do the <strong>MOB</strong> (as in the public) will turn on them. Won&#39;t really matter if the IT guy who rigged the election only did so to get enough money to get his sick wife to the doctors who could treat herso she could tell us the meaning of life, the public feels betrayed and might lynch the foolish geek.</p>

<p>Another part is that when you have direct democracy you soon see who self-identifies as what. Do you start your identity trail with your Race, your Nation, your indigenious tribe, your city? People start their trail with different things, some people can be proud of the heritage and at the same time very patriotic, but ask them to choose and it will be their Race/Tribe that recieves priority over their national identity nearly every time. Nations aren&#39;t a homogenous group, they&#39;re made of many different cultures <em>and inside each other those cultures are people who begin their identity trails seperately</em>. </p>

<p>Direct Democracy looks good on paper, and might be the best option for those who are aware of its risks and can predict mistakes to take action to avoid them. I don&#39;t know if humans are ready to utilize the information technology we have for direct democracy, it seems evident we still make mistakes when using this technology in representative democracy.</p>

<p>Then again, I&#39;m also an anarchist <strong>fuck voting</strong>. If voting actually changed anything they&#39;d make it illegal. </p>

<p>EDIT: almost 11 I&#39;ll try to pick it up again tomorrow, pls be civil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While a vote obviously won&#39;t solve all our problems, some seem keen to take away whatever measure of power a vote carries by making it difficult if not impossible for certain groups to caste one, don&#39;t they? But anyway, I was just responding to your last sentence there - I tend to see the &quot;they&#39;d make it illegal&quot; argument pop up once in a while, so...</p>

<p>As to the rest of your post. Doesn&#39;t the average IT guy like fixing things so that they aren&#39;t broken anymore? For example, here&#39;s an article: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/06/03/this-computer-programmer-solved-gerrymandering-in-his-spare-time/">This computer programmer solved gerrymandering in his spare time</a>. I suppose if the system is set up a certain way it would lead to corrupting influence as IT guys could make money off of doing scummy things, and I&#39;ll just take your word that the particular scenario you/OP are describing/envisioning as far as this particular method of democracy would be as such, but I&#39;m sure there are plenty of ways that IT can be used to give people more of a say in what goes on, and a more educated say, that goes beyond choosing candidates for office or directly voting on every law that comes up.</p>

<p>Perhaps things can be organized for people to share their ideas with each other more efficiently, and then present a set of arguments as a group, saving politicians from having to sort through thousands of letters to figure out what is being asked for, and enabling them to respond to the body as a whole, initiating an easier back-and-froth dialog. Although if a politician isn&#39;t responsive, the group can respond by not voting for the politician next election.</p>

<p>Or! In some situations the politician might be able to respond by suggesting methods that the group can use to meet their needs that don&#39;t involve introducing and voting on legislation.</p>

<p>We might also want to encourage politicians to publish the letters they send out to people to their website, so that people can refer to them (&quot;I&#39;m responding to letter 17X1-B: Parks Service&quot;) when talking to each other or writing their representatives.</p>

<p>Even if we don&#39;t change the political system, we can use IT to make it more efficient to participate in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem about the IT part, is there are no technology that can truly tell a human from a computer. So bots would be a problem. But for something like that to happen, we would need much better technology standards anyway, so I hope until than they have solved that problem.</p>

<p>And about the majority, and all that race/tribe thing, the effect of such system on this is that everyone would be able to expose a problem and propose a solution, and everybody would be able to vote, taking part on real time multivoting, making it believable to minorities and majorities to cooperate knowing that both will have their demands heard, and that they could rapidly adapt the demand based on reactions bringing  further conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So instead of corruptible human interference in the electronically-direct democracy it&#39;s ... artificial intelligence... interfering? To what end? Why would robots interfere of their own free will, if they had it?</p>

<p>As for the second part I think it&#39;s a bit of irrational wishful thinking, since it seems to assume everything would be going well in the discussions of the problem, but we know that&#39;s not going to be perfect from previous evidence in history, some people are too obstinate to give up on failed positions and intermittently what seemed like the best idea at the time may end up excaberating the problem elsewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no artificial intelligence reference in my comment. I  just pointed that there is no technology that prevents online fraud by telling apart a real human from a computer bot.  </p>

<p>As for my second thought, assuming everybody would have same power in a society like this, the only thing that could make one person be more heard in one proposition than other is obviously a rational and overall good proposition. Their inability to accept defeat would not play a part in this system since overall  people would only vote for best choices for everyone, instead of listening to crazy demands or irrational sense of pride.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is incorrect. CAPTCHA is evolving and will soon start requiring problem-solving tasks or mini game-like scenarios that only a human can accomplish. Also, with a state-level or national-level digital democracy system, it would likely require citizens to log in using their social security # and perhaps some other personal information. Dual authentication could also be required for an extra layer of security, which means that when a person tries to log in a code would get sent to their phone which they would need to enter. This makes it so that the only way a hacker could hack into an account is if they had the person&#39;s actual phone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand that technologies like captcha or any other is later translated into a code key or a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; statement. Don&#39;t matter how complex the task is in the end the computer require a response from the software that is only another code. There is inumerous ways to bypass this technology. And as for phone and ID use. The same apply. You have to understand that phones are still
Software and hardware. For experienced hackers to take over a phone, or clone it is a easy task. And to collect personal data is even easier. You can argue on &#39;voice&#39; or &#39;fingerprint&#39; or any other. But you have to understand ALL technology is later translated to CODE. And can be hacked until this day. But as technology evolve we may start to see new solutions.</p>

<p>To put my point simple, if someone creates a way to tell people from a computer that is not hackable he or she will win the Nobel prize. And for a system like this to exist we would need this kind of technology first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, i think as technology evolves and as the security of the grid is now mainstream big companies will eventually find a cure for bots. Also companies like Google or Amazon, and also Facebook lose tons of money daily due to having to pay to server storage and bandwidth that is spammed by bots, they are even more interested in a new and bulletproof way to tell a person from a bot. Soon or later it will be here. When that happen people will be able to believe in a government network without the fear of hacking.

<p>That&#39;s a fair argument. Keep in mind however that if a national level or state level digital democracy system were to be set up, it would likely draw only those who really care about the direction their state or country was heading. I think people would take it much more seriously once they realize how powerful the system can be. You could also give people the ability to delegate their votes to someone else whom they trust to make a better judgment on specific issues that they may not be well-versed in.</p>

And not a shaddy scheme of laws that hide all the real motive in thousand of complex vocabulary and references to other shaddy laws. We would first vote on what should be voted, and then have the other initial vote. Also if it didn&#39;t worked as respected people would be able to rapidly create a solution and open another discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually capitalism will do the job itself. Capitalism is a self fulfilling prophecy, as technology evolves and people are eventually more informed on daily basis, automated creation and self governing is the next step for capitalists, as the 1%  of the world capital leaders only move forward to obtain more resources it is also their wish to cut expenses. Just as you see less stores selling CDs or DVDs, less people been employed to work in fabrics, the powerful are cutting expenses to make then richer. They are the same paying for researches to create new powerful robots, AI,  faster computers, and automated food growing process, their ultimate plan is to have all of this working so in the end they won&#39;t need to pay anybody else. Self repairing machines, automated vehicle supply, all controlled from a single human user that can turn it off or rise prices. That way soon or later humanity will have a fully generated paradise. No pollution, everything recycled, no poverty, free  clean energy. Capitalism work so fucking good that it will also end itself because it is the best business decision!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting concept... Never heard of that term before.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how I feel about the concept of randomizing our representatives. The core issue of corruption can be prevented by decentralizing power. Right now we have 535 representatives compared to 313 citizens in the United States. That&#39;s an easy target for corporations and wealthy individuals to attempt bribes. We could improve the current system by increasing the number of representatives, or we could consider switching to a delegative democracy, which is where anyone can be a representative, or delegate, for any number of citizens on multiple (or all) issues. The ideal system in my mind is to have a direct, digital democracy that gives citizens the ability to delegate their votes to people whom they trust to make a better decision, and to rescind their votes at any time when they feel they are not being properly represented, and so transfer their vote to another delegate, vote themselves, or not at all.</p>

<p>Current system is corrupt as shit and does not operate for the people. When enough people realize this it will have to change.</p>

<p>I am all in for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minarchism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minarchism</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Minarchism (also known as minimal statism) is a political philosophy. It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it holds that states ought to exist (as opposed to anarchy), that their only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and that the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police, and courts. In the broadest sense, it also includes fire departments, prisons, the executive, and legislatures as legitimate government functions.[1][2][3] Such states are generally called night-watchman states.</p>

<p>Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly of force to interfere with free transactions between people, and see the state&#39;s sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected, through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a laissez-faire approach to the economy is most likely to lead to economic prosperity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is technically possible to produce both economic and electoral systems that are inherently honest based upon their algorithmic design, much like the Bitcoin system. Bitcoin is almost 100% uncompromisable, due to the way transactions are processed the only way to compromise the system is for over 50% of all machines involved in processing to be compromised.</p>

<p>The problem is instituting such systems. The people in the current positions of power don&#39;t want to see something like this, they are paid for by those who use money and power to corrupt. How we could possibly institute such a system is a better question.</p>

<p>Yes, which is why there would need to be some sort of oversight committee made up of ordinary citizens with technical expertise chosen by the people to regulate the system and ensure that it is secure and functioning properly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The p2p government is inevitable. All kind of cultures are moving in a more decentralized fashion. Even if powerful people try to fight it, longevity is against then. If today some powerful person go against a decentralized internet, and a decentralized government, his sons and his generation will receive different education from the outside and trend. Soon or later the better for everyone will be the only way.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s natural selection, when we can&#39;t use oil anymore, when government has lost all its credibility, when people became so hard to trust one another, we will have to adapt to a system that is non-trust-based, like Bitcoin, and where it is self sustaining. In a world where trust is a word for fools, the only natural path is a p2p non trust based system.</p>

<p>Given that today almost anything can be controlled by computers, when this revolution comes we would be able to  vote on something specific and let computers control machines to do it directly, or help us to do it.</p>

<p>Also I think this will bring more freedom where minorities will finally be heard in a open fashion, while opposition will be the healthiest part of society because it will not benefit then directly instead be used to bring further conversation.  </p>
