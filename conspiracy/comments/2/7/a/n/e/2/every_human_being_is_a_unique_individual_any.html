       Mob rule or wisdom of the crowd? I'm leaning towards humanity is inherently good and communication is what will lead us to be a peaceful society. We tend to have complimentary personalities that balance each other well. It's when one perspective is held over all others that you have conflict, tyranny, etc. I think that by embracing a collective and holding each perspective as equal and appreciating our similarities via communication and sharing that we will begin to appreciate our differences and truly become individuals, rather than other people having a fear response because it is an unfamiliar perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't misunderstand, I'm not advocating a government necessarily. In fact, get rid of "civilization" and we become more civilized. I don't think we need money constructs to motivate people to compete because people have biological motivators to create works they are passionate about, can gain mastery over, and that contribute to society. People are better at giving other people credit than lobbied court systems. If we embrace communication, create a truly equal society, and work off of passion rather than profit, and stop forcing competition with fake constructs, I believe we would have a very peaceful society naturally.

       It's a pretty intelligent rant my friend and I mostly agree with you...the MSM has been selling and promoting fear from pretty much it's inception and I think a collapse of government would bring people together not turn them into a bunch of mindless zombie food rioters! But I think what Hesse was talking about is the soulless communism and socialism that was first being implemented around his time in Europe and the masses falling prey to SAFETY and FEAR rather than developing themselves and evolve our conscience and our consciousness. And yes...we need other perspectives for a healthy world, wel et the MSM polarize us into black and white thinking with no solution but the government or corporate ones. We are all in this together but your thoughts are not my own as my thoughts are not yours...so let's learn to respect each others human rights without taking others rights away.

       Also it's a good time to start following the laws of the closed system that houses us, which are those of the universe and not some arbitrary and subjective definition by some narcissistic authority figure.

      <p>
       The more artificial subsystems we create to 'accommodate' us, the more entropy sets we are subjected to.

      <p>
       Religion, governments, state institutions, companies etc are nothing more that self destruct mechanisms, disguised as protectors, and the issues that governments are seemingly trying to fix are issues caused by the system itself, and then sold as 'progress'.

       You cannot oppress anything, any form of oppression is destructive to a system, no matter where it's coming from. Every man should be free to follow his path and fulfil his desires as he wishes.

       It might seem a ridiculous concept with our current mental state, but it's possible within a generation by developing critical thinking, reasoning and communication skills instead of spamming people with junk.

       I agree, any attempt to "replace" individuality with collective identity would be unwise as it goes against human nature. The solution is to maintain one's individuality, but add a collective identity on top of it. The realization that you are not simply a separate entity, but also part of a greater whole, and that the health and happiness of the collective will improve your health and happiness as well, is very important.

       This is the same justification that socialists have been using since their inception. People are either free or cattle to be herded by whomever is strongest. These halfway justifications are just a way to legitimize control over others, all for ostensibly pure, heartfelt motives.

       Totally...a subtle but necessary challenge in the "collectivism versus a group of individuals " paradigm is that the individuals remain individuals within a group and not resort to hive mind thinking...that is why it is so easy to polarize people in North America...they are individuals with strong opinions about stuff...so we need to learn to be easy on the people but hard on the problem...and not turn against each other every time we have a differing opinion. Gay marriage, abortion, and other topics like this simply seek to split us apart.
