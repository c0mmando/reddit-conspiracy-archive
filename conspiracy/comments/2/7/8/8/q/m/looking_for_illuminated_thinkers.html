I am looking for thinkers who can crank out extraordinary ideas... so I have a created a test question and I like to call it &quot;the Hastings question&quot;:</p>

<p>If you were in a car that was being remote controlled by someone outside of the car and you knew they were going to crash it and kill you, what would be the one thing you would do to stop this act from happening? (Note: think like you already have anything at your disposal)</p>

<p>I am looking forward to seeing your answers. This question could open the door for you depending on your answer</p>

<p>For clarity: You discovered this while traveling down the highway, and you believe you have 1 mile left till the next on-ramp (a likely place to turn your insides out), you discovered this when you tried to change lanes.</p>

<p>Fine, wanna do something that helps fight back? Stop funding the machine.  Go live on your own land.  Don&#39;t use electricity because it is funding mega energy corps.  Same with natural gas or coal.  Live off the land you own.  Plant your own crops so you don&#39;t eat GMO&#39;s and thus give them more money.  No more TV or Internet because that goes to one of 7 mega media corporations in the world.  Be self sustaining so you have nothing that can actually be taxed. </p>

<p>Deprive everything you strive against of what drives them.  Money. </p>

<p>For the record, insulting someone as worthless is a shill of a manipulative tool used to get stupid people to say stupid things that get them in trouble.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t a valid response to my question.  Creating money devalues it.  Without something behind it creating it, it becomes worthless.  Thus inflation.

<p>These days the control over you is to keep you docile. They don&#39;t need your money, they do oppress you with it but their biggest fear isn&#39;t you cutting off their funds, they are afraid of you finding out what&#39;s really up and taking a stand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the reality of the world you aren&#39;t seeing.  Money is god.  If you have no need for money because you are self sustaining, they have no means to control you within the given system.  </p>

<p>Words aren&#39;t worth shit.  Every blogger inks a thousand words.  Every conspiracy book paints a picture with a million words.  And yet the world gets worse.  Why? Because words don&#39;t mean shit.  They do precisely nothing.  Like every occupy wall street rally, every tea party rally, every anti-war rally.  Pointless, all of it. Money is god.  </p>

<p>Why do we have free speech zones? Because they don&#39;t want to hear your shit.  Words in this political era are miniscule in power coming form one or two people on a forum.  If words changed countries from the mouths of the likes of you, it would have changed years ago.  </p>

<p>And in case you didn&#39;t notice, we do have higher taxes.  They just spread them out so its less noticeable.  And lower them on the rich.  You seem to live in some ideological fairy land that makes you think money means nothing, words change the world, and people on a forum are free from an NSA that collects and stores images from yahoo video chats in other countries. </p>

<p>As most good ideas, it&#39;s simple and effective. Of course, just like all the <em>&#39;disable the pump/hack the electronics/portable EMP&#39;</em> ideas here, doubt there would be much time before one realizes to have lost control and the crash. Perhaps <a href="http://www.looxcie.com/">something like this</a> would become a necessity for certain individuals/professions, akin to the cams on russian cars....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you pull the right fuses or wires you can disable fuel pump which cuts the engine completly so even if someone is remotely accessing the vehicle there is no power to the pump.. ive been in a situation where a car had no brakes and I wasnt informed... emergency brake to the floor and a lil curb sliding were my instant reactions as well as ignition off then back to acc for power steering.. intense but worth the experience jus to kno what would you do in a split second disaster </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The correct answer is to turn your car into a stealth Faraday cage <em>before</em> anyone fucks with it.  If anything is getting installed inside your car <strong>your opsec sucks</strong> and a remote driver is the least of it considering a bomb could have killed you once you turned on the blasted vehicle.</p>

<p>First, tie a mattress to the top of the car and install lead plates inside.  These will block any signals emitting from the vehicle.  Next put a lot of obnoxious kitchen magnets on top of really strong magnets (obscuring them) strategically on the front and rear bumper to scramble any electronics attached to the outside of the car.  Finally, in case of emergencies have a thermal blanket tied up under the mattress, so if you get chased you can pull off-road, pull down the blanket and the drones won&#39;t see you.  It&#39;ll be good to also keep sticks and leaves and other shit in the trunk to throw over the car like a Gilly suit if need be.</p>

<p>This car is horrendous for gas efficiency, turning, and picking up chicks, but it will save your life if you ever find yourself in a scenario like the one hypothesized today!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shoot the hostage. </p>

<p>:-D</p>

<p>Fun Hypothetical. And I&#39;m going to have fun with it. ymmv .</p>

<p>I&#39;d verify that vehicle controls are completely unresponsive. I&#39;d then go for a shut down, before resorting to violence. Throwing the vehicle into park and then into reverse could throw the vehicle into limp mode, due to disagreeing values, which would limit the top speed significantly. If that is over-ridden... It&#39;s time for a more direct approach.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is learn about the systems in your vehicle. Get a full service manual. Then wire in an system ignition interrupt that is hard-wired to interrupt the coil driver&#39;s - side and insulated from the CAN BUS (or whatever is an appropriate approach). An ounce of prevention.</p>

<p>I have done this on a few cars, just as a &quot;not an alarm&quot; theft by hot wiring deterrent for the vehicles I have built wiring harnesses for. It&#39;s pretty easy, and you can even set up a logic gate across a few switches so it is like a simple combo lock. </p>

<p>You haven&#39;t done that, You are entirely unprepared for the consequences of accidentally having run over Bo and Sunny (Who left the fucking gate open?! It&#39;s THEIR fault!), it&#39;s time for a little controlled violence against the vehicle.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what kind of things YOU would have on you. I always have a sturdy leatherman, and a knife at least. I would go for the EIS gateway initially. The box that the ignition IR remote thigamabobfob goes into. Destroy that fucker. Pulling fuses from under the dash probably won&#39;t do much, as systems critical fuses are usually under the hood, and the mains can be under the hood, the rear seat, or in the trunk. </p>

<p>If I were in a Mercedes with tele-aid, I would remove the upper control panel. The thing with the map lights, compass, near the rain sensor. Ripping that guy out could break the connection. If that failed, I would try to pull up the rear seat and rip out the fuel pump relay (depending on the vehicle. All of this is vehicle dependent).</p>

<p>Other than that... I would have to know exactly where the engine control module is in the vehicle, and I would have to be able to access it. Also, you could probably access a chassis CAN bus bar under the driver&#39;s side floor and rip that out, but... That&#39;s harder than pulling up the rear seat, if that is where the shit is... </p>

<p>Know your vehicle. It&#39;s pretty basic. </p>

<p>If you carry a firearm or a tazer, use it on the stereo to shut off &quot;Who Will Save Your Soul?&quot; which began blasting as soon as the vehicle was taken over. Next, shoot the overhead control panel and your cell phone at the same time (I don&#39;t know how much ammo you have, but you might NEED all of it! :-D). Next, shoot out a speaker, because you liked that song, and you are angry that it was being used against you. </p>

<p>Is the car still out of control? Try it out. Yeah? Fuck. </p>

<p>If all else fails, break out a window and surf that bitch to death. </p>

<p>If you were in a car that was being remote controlled by someone outside of the car and you knew they were going to crash it and kill you, what would be the one thing you would do to stop this act from happening?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well...considering that it&#39;s been shown that the car can be remotely controlled <em>completely</em> - as in you can&#39;t exit the car (doors locked, windows up), you can&#39;t stop the car (regular and emergency breaks don&#39;t work), you can&#39;t turn the car off (ignition is locked and controlled), you can&#39;t steer off and halt the car that way (steering wheel controlled) - then I&#39;m not sure you would simply not be completely fucked.</p>

<p>So what would be the one thing I would do to stop the act from happening considering all these things?  Assuming I don&#39;t have a gun to simply shoot out one of the windows and jump out of the car? I can&#39;t say I&#39;d do anything but zen out and wait for the coming crash Ra&#39;s al Ghul style (ala what he does at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0OwHPZX73Q">14 second mark here</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Note: think like you already have anything at your disposal)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait a minute.  Think like I DO already have &quot;anything at my disposal&quot;?  Well shit.  If I have &quot;anything&quot; at my disposal, I&#39;d just take the computer that programmed the car and DE-program it.  How simple would that be?</p>

<p>Or hell, if I <em>really</em> have &quot;anything&quot; at my disposal, then I also have the ability to simply stop the car <em>on my own</em> - using the mental powers that I was able to acquire through your &quot;you can have anything at your disposal&quot; rule.  The car wouldn&#39;t even take off under those circumstances in that case.</p>

<p>You sure you want to have that rule in there?  It makes it <em>really</em> easy to quickly neutralize your hypothetical scenario that way...</p>

<p>All that being said, you actually DID directly say it to me in particular in your first response to me.  You said K.I.S.S. - as in telling the person you made that statement toward (i.e. me) to &quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot;.</p>

<p>Reading your sub OP text, you didn&#39;t actually make any mention of the 50mph part.  So you want to insert that into the scenario now?</p>

<p>Okay.  If I were in a &quot;Michael Hastingsed&quot; car doing 50mpg and I could manifest any physical object, what would I do?  That&#39;s a simple one too.  I&#39;d just manifest a big ass, fire-department-grade foam pad that the car runs into and gets fully cushioned by.</p>

<p>I imagine that you&#39;ll also say &quot;Nuh uh, man!  You can&#39;t do that either!&quot;...so what is it exactly that you&#39;re looking for since you keep putting up these restrictions whenever a plausible scenario is mentioned to your consistently-changing guidelines?</p>

<p>I already said that if death is imminent and there really isn&#39;t anything that can be done about it under &quot;normal&quot; circumstances, then I&#39;d just simply be chill and &quot;Ra&#39;s al Ghul&quot; it.  Meh.</p>
