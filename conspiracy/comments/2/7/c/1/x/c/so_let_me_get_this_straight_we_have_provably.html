       It shouldn't confuse you.  Here.  I'll explain it to you.  This might help:
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB don't give a flying
       <em>
        fuck
       </em>
       about you, me, or the rest of the population of plebs.  We are less than expendable chattel to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They make it a point to write up big, complicated laws, rules, regulations, and amendments that are designed and intended ONLY for the plebs/expendable chattel to follow - not them.  They set up huge, massive industries that revolve around these conditional rules and regulations;  they set up entire educational systems designed to indoctrinate entire swaths of the population and make the plebs believe that "these rules and regulations are the
       <em>
        law
       </em>
       of the land!" and that "everyone" is held down, bound by them, and is supposed to follow them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        They
       </em>
       are not held down and bound by them, however.  They don't pay attention to them.  They do wtf they want - often going directly against the very things they make a huge show about making sure that everyone else follows.  They bend and twist those rules in whatever way they want and apply them to whoever or whatever they want with almost zero fear of repercussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the way this planet has been functioning for quite some time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       There.  I hope that helped clear your mind a bit.  I hope you're no longer as confused as you were before.  :)  Cheers,

       Who is "they"? There is no monolithic power pulling all the strings. Everyone behaves in their own self interest, and those with more power get to set up the rules in their favor. Not much of a conspiracy

       You realize you are in r/conspiracy, right? Just checking...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, you are partially right (the part about everyone acting upon their own interests). So, lets do a quick thought experiment...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, lets assume one person has more power than anyone else. This coukd be due to his position, his job, his wealth, etc, whatever. Now, lets assume the next most powerful person has similar interests as the number one dude. Wouldnt it be beneficial for them to synergetically create a relationship amongst the two of them, to pool their assets together and be that much more powerful?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, extrapolate that to world politics over hundreds of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Symbiotic relatiinships are a natural phenomenon. They happen everywhere. Why couldnt humans, in the setting of world politics, leadership, and power, figure out the same thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is they already have. For a long time, the "right" people have been scratching eachothers backs, looking out for eachother, amassing unbelievable wealth. They are in every corner of our government, the FDA, Big Pharma, NSA, FBI, law enforcement, dept. Of justice, education, agriculture, transportation, and health.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are all together in this. There is no other way that our government can be the way it is today without someone (or someones) somewhere making the shots for this specific outcome. And, it just so happens that for this agenda to be successful, a monolithic type structure of heirarchy and power must be present, however esoterical.

       Understood. Now let's do a thought experiment the other way. I'll agree that many powerful institutions band together to form powerful alliances. But suppose some of those institutions have interests that substantially conflict. There's is always someone who feels marginalized when power/money is distributed. No one ever feels like they got their fair share.
      </p>
      <p>
       Institutions are forced to compete for the same market space, influence, power, etc. For the most part they are still able to operate free from external regulation, but there are definite constraints (i.e. govt, public perception, other institutions are all obstacles that need to be overcome).
      </p>
      <p>
       You say that "they are all together in this." I agree corporations have a tremendous amount of control over all aspects of our government functions, but I don't think there is some sort of alliance of central planners who are puffing cigars and pulling the country's strings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for taking the time to respond, though.

       Well said sir. Id say this part is my grey area, as i havent done tons of research on tbis specific topic. But, from what i understand, the power structure itself (of the alledged monolithic group of elites) is pretty intricate. At the bottom are CEOs of google walmart etc., then goes up to the bankers, then the government officials like legislatures, top brass, office holders etc., then goes up to the top where the owners of the federal reserve are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill admit, when going that deep in the rabbit hole, i find to reserve my beliefs from my research, amd this is basically the power structre (or one version of it) conspiracy subscribers view as real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont necessarily believe that much into it, but i do find it plausible and worth more investigating. The alledged structure is based on a need to know basis throughout its hierarchy, like an esoteric group inside another esoteric group. (Parallels with what some think of as the freemasons pyramid hierarchy...)
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that further explains what i was trying to say.

       To what degree of intracacy i cannot say, but i do believe there is a central alliance that more or less pulls the strings, or at least have enough influence to guide the strings...

       But do you think that the people near the top of that power structure have the ability to control those closer to the bottom? Or do you believe that their interests merely subsume those below them? I tend to think it's the latter.

       I tend to lean on the side where their most intimate interests lie within a tight knit group made of the heads of all (or at least many) departments and corporations etc. Their most important agenda does not necessarily need to be known by the lowers of the elite. As i saod before, i see it as more of a need-to-know sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its totally possible, IMO. But, i will admit that i cant 100% back that theory up in faith.. i just see this as the most plausible reasoning.

       I don't need your condescension buddy. And I'm not going to throw author names back in your face, either. I know what you think you're saying and I think your premise is correct, that there are powerful institutions that organize society in their best interest. I don't think that those powers are static the way you seem to think they are. And I certainly don't think it is a single "they" who holds such power. Unfortunate that you don't have the patience for a discussion but I suppose it is more fun to wave your dick at the crowd from your ivory tower.

       The sole question I have in all that, though, is how do new people make it into those ranks if the system is so rigged? For example, neither Bill Gates nor Mark Zuckerberg were born to the wealthy elite ruling class.

       Oh it certainly and absolutely applies to a lot of religion.  The "industry of lies and manipulation" that I was referring to wasn't just the industry of the educational system alone.  What I said applies to the industry of religion,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the industry of science as well.  Heck, in this day and age, the industry of science is
       <em>

       </em>
       rife with their manipulation.

      <p>
       Which ranks?  TPTB ranks or the ranks of the elite rats/plebs?  If you mean the latter, then that's easy.  TPTB choose who they want to be in front, and they manipulate things so that
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       particular rat/pleb (the "Obama" rat/pleb, or the "Clinton" or "Bush" rat/pleb, etc) gets in front.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you meant how is it that one makes it into THEIR ranks? as in how does a rat/pleb make it into the super elite PTB ranks?

      <p>
       Well...they don't.  We stay down.

       It's certainly very eye-opening for anyone that doesn't understand the true extent of the influence and power involved.

       I don't necessarily presume to know "the true extent" involved, but I

       certainly know that it's absolutely monolithic, and quite likely extra-planetary.

       Well at first look it could have been at the request/demand of the Taliban to get those specific guys back. We probably wanted to show the price of an American life or something. Most of the 'innocents' are probably not from or attached to the Taliban in any way.

       A)  Because we are getting out of Afghanistan and you do not leave a soldier behind.  Maybe he was a deserter, maybe not.  Either way you get him home then deal with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       B)  Because swapping prisoners is what you do with a real enemy in a real war.  By consenting to a prisoner swap we are giving the entire war on terror a bit of legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       C)  The 5 we are swapping are well respected in Taliban circles but not particularly dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       D)  We've wrung them dry of any possible useful intelligence, or have flipped one or more of them to provide assistance in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       E) The full weight of our surveillance apparatus now has five people tp follow and see where they go and who they talk to.  They will probably generate a lot of intelligence for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       F)  Drones, remember those?  We sent them to a place where we have permission to blow people up.  They act up, they blow up.

       Hey i like your analysis, so dont take this negatively...

      <p>
       But, i found a problem with your "B)". A real war is started with congressional approval (correct me if im wrong, but i dont recall congression approval for the start of the war on terrorism... Seriously, correct me if im wrong there) between the U.S. and another country.
      </p>

       As the taliban dont really have their own country, we cant really, technically be at war with them.

       Technically correct, which is the best kind of correct.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       The "War on terror" is a rhetorical device more than anything else.  Congress declared that the president had the existing authority to prosecute the war on terror under the war powers act.  Thus removing the pesky technicality of not having someone to declare war against or having a clear victory condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       When this mess started, the Taliban was the sort-of-legitimate ruling party of Afghanistan.  It doesn't exactly work that way over there but close enough.  There were some serious legal and philosophical calisthenics performed to make them both the government of Afghanistan and a shadowy terrorist organization, depending on the PR needs of the moment.

       Well, there could be a lot more that we dont know or arent allowed to know about this transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, with the i.formation that is provided, and obamas track record of shitting on all the rules, i am obligated to believe this is a setup, until more ibformation is gathered about this. To what means? Who knows. All i know is obama is educated enough in the right areas, hes charming enough, and hes intelligent enough, to pull this off and dupe the american people.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand, he "saved" a fellow american soldier. On the other hand, he saved FIVE serious terrorists. Not to mention the mentality of the dude freed was a deserter and apparrantly was known to not have favorable views of america. The military knew where he was for something like five years, and NOW they just release him?
      </p>
      <p>
       No doubt this is at least a publicity stunt, probably aimed at the armed forces members amd their families so obama cam be like, "see? I DO care about our soldiers" which is completely ignorant of the fact that he, by law, must consult congress on these kinds of deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       He no doubt knows all of this. This is why i believe there is a reason for it. The only logical conclusion i can come up with is this is a setup. Eigher for a terrorist attack (of course, a false flag) or a botched false flag/terrorist attack so he can be all like, "see? This is why we need NSA surveillance."

       It confuses you because it makes no sense. And it makes no sense because the story being circulated leaves out a lot of useful information.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, why would the US hold these 'dangerous' Tallibanster bosses for TWELVE years and then suddenly trade FIVE of them for ONE deserter/traitor/POW private? The US isn't accustomed to getting the short end of a deal. So assuming they didn't get the short end:
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is this Bergdahl really??
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe the US didn't get shorted, maybe the global Bigsters are setting up to get rid of Obama with this front page showmanship. There are rumblings of impeachment. Maybe the Bigsters are about to hang their own teleprompter-in-chief as he has lost his useful idiotness?
      </p>

       There are definitely some serious backround shenanigans going on here. This show is not what it appears to be.

       My prediction is Obama has no idea what he's doing and he thought Bergdahl could give intel. The other prediction is Obama wanted to show how much he cares about American life after Benghazi..

       Obama released the deserter because that's what he's gonna do.  If anyone knows the shit is about to hit the fan, it's Obama, and I think he's done with it all.  Impeachment talk is happening, and I think this is as planned.  Obama's gonna get impeached and WW3 is on someone else's hands...

       Let me highlight some words you might have skipped over:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How many US Presidents have ever been impeached and
        <strong>
         forced to leave office
        </strong>
        ?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Two US Presidents have been impeached. Neither was forced to leave office as a result. Clinton was one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       One US President was forced to leave office but was not impeached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither will happen to Obama. He will not be impeached (they may attempt it, but it will fail.) He will not be forced to leave office. It's all partisan political bickering.

       I tend to agree. It woukd be great for some hearings, and itb be better for some result. But, as you pointed out, in all probability it wilk be shrugged off by some technicality or loophole (being a previous constitutional lawyer sure helps that case) and hell go on like before.

       To trade 5 taliban commanders for a deserter, all while a family is still held hostage by the taliban, and not notify congress, that's criminal negligence.  But that's OK, because I think Obama planned this.
