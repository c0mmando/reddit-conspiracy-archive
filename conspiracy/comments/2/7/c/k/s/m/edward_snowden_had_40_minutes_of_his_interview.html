<li>What good is a police state if the people don&#39;t know they live in one?*</li>
</ul>

<p>US oligarchies have benefitted greatly in that they now have a citizenry that really <em>is</em> afraid of just how powerful they now <em>concretely</em> know the US and its surveillance capacity is.  Before those that talked about this were just &quot;guessing&quot; and being called &quot;stupid, tin foil hat-wearing conspiracy theorists&quot; for talking about the NSA&#39;s and the US&#39; surveillance abilities.  As a result, the vast majority of the ignorant, naysaying citizenry was not only able to keep their cognitive dissonance nicely in check, but <em>they weren&#39;t scared of the surveillance state</em>.  That&#39;s very important, by the way.  They weren&#39;t afraid of TPTB or their ability to surveil/spy on the citizenry.</p>

<p>Now, however?  Sheeit.  The citizenry is all scared and up in arms about just how powerful they now <em>know</em> the NSA and the US surveillance state is.</p>

<p>And why do they feel that now?  Why does everybody now &quot;know&quot;?  It&#39;s only because <em>one</em> patsy came on the news and was given all kinds of airtime by the MSM as they said &quot;Yes.  the US and the NSA really <em>is</em> that strong and powerful.  Be afraid, America.  Be <em>very</em> afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>And the American people have followed suit <em>very</em> nicely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple analysis. </p>

<p>Manning was brutally tortured. He was a legit whistleblower. They fucked up his mind so good he even thinks he&#39;s a woman now. This was the message to any leaker in the army: &quot;We don&#39;t even have to kill you, but look what we can do to you.&quot;</p>

<p>Shwartz? Killed. Hastings? Killed. JFK? Killed. MLK? Killed. You fuck with the NWO, you die.</p>

<p>Snowden White/Greenwald/Assange get free boarding in cushy embassies, free air travel to Russia of all places, unlimited TV airtime, all this after &quot;exposing&quot; top secret documents? They are being allowed to live because they are playing the conspiracy crowd, giving them false heroes. If anything, they are traitors to the people. I don&#39;t buy a single word they utter. None of their leaks have not been reported before they showed up, and most likely they will live long lives unless they get Bin Laden&#39;d or Hussein&#39;d, wear out their usefullness. The USG leaves no loose ends.</p>

<p>Being in the military means you signed a document giving the ownership of your corporate person to the U.S. government, I&#39;m all for whistle blowers but, you can&#39;t exactly expect to get far when they can legally lock you away and then maybe give you a military trial if you are lucky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Annd that&#39;s why Snowden fled before he leaked, and why Brazil gave Greenwald federal agency protection, and why the Guardian had their HQ raided and drives destroyed, and why senators family members who backed Snowden dropped dead (Udall&#39;s brother, if memory serves).  You don&#39;t know how many <em>did</em> die supporting them or making sure they made it, including Assange.  They couldn&#39;t kill them once the story was out, damage was done and in the hands of multiple top journalist outlets.  It would be far more damaging to kill them by proving their perspective and writings - so they might even actually have had to protect them from their own internal factions for PR purposes, ironically. </p>

<p>Assange is a political prisoner and has released unbelievably important documents that are still accessible - go have a look tough guy. Daniel Ellsberg was, I guess, also a controlled agent even though Nixon tried to have him killed, according to him!  Sometimes people survive, sometimes people don&#39;t.  That powers that be aren&#39;t <em>all powerful</em>, they just have large advantages, like resources and positioning. </p>

<p>You want to talk about simple analysis, look in the mirror you delusional piece of blank narcissist.  You&#39;re incredibly dangerous with your narcissistic levels of pontification.. you&#39;re incredibly dangerous to those who dissent.  You need to take a fucking step back and check yourself <em>immediately</em>, because you&#39;re tarnishing truly brave people - many of whom will never be mentioned but did what they felt was right and what needed doing.  I would love to be standing next to you right now hearing you say this shit you lowlife scum.  Good people helped them, and they were aware enough and insightful enough to survive <em>because</em> of those who came before them.  There are literally dozens of other whistleblowers who aren&#39;t dead, including former NSA, CIA, military, etc.etc.  They assassinate character and tarnish reputation, and suppress whistleblowers first - those lacking the documents Snowden had.  Burn in fucking hell you armchair piece of shit clueless coward.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you pretty much hit the nail on the head there, kudos ( though i think i sound like douche saying kudos )</p>

<p>and the Mind fucK powers they seem to have are pretty scary, such as the kony guy ( so the kony thing was made by a fake charity, which mainly got their money and were good ol freinds of the family with the higherups at one of chase&#39;s other wings chase military which specifically finances soldiers so they can buy decent gear because uncle sam gives them shit, (all the while you&#39;ve got canadian&#39;s like troy hurtubise who made a ridiculously capable armor suit, that incredibly weighs 50lbs or something, and has been made to look like a joke, no one likes to mention the charged energy beam things he dreamt of and had physicists help make, in the basement of a northbay home, the first one was hazardous, but could see through walls, and shoot down a missle, the second apparently cures cancer, ) 
so the invisible children fake charity is funded by chase, the reason for the campaign which was made a mockery of as they wanted people to buy posters to put up and not print them out themselves, was to make people think there was a reason to go to Africa to wage a war, because child soldiers are bad and kony is wherre we need to obtain coltan from, he&#39;s not there anymore, hasnt been for awhile ,</p>

<p>so after all this shit happens, one of the guys from the invisible children for whatever reason goes fucking ape shit and is what running around somewhere naked trying to mutilate his genitals or something, and hitting his head off the pavement repeatedly and yelling something about getting the voices out of his head, </p>

<p>you can buy flexible carbon tube armor, theres tanks on every police force, if there was the effort to better the lives of every individual instead of taking as much as they can from the poor and telling everyone else how to live while they give themselves pretty much the same toys or better then batmans, the whole world would be so much better off,

    <div class="md"><p>Ok sorry for my own wall of text here, but I have to deconstruct the top text here a little bit:</p>

<p>&quot;What good is a police state if the people don&#39;t know they live in one?*&quot;</p>

<p>It is always preferred for people NOT to know they are in a cage &amp; being controlled. So much easier to control. Basic human nature there. If people go on about their business, working for the system, paying their taxes, not worrying about their surroundings, <em>that&#39;s what the control system wants/prefers</em>. They aren&#39;t going alert people to their own control, because that might lead to people waking up. And then doing something about it. </p>

<p>This macho-dickhead mentality of &quot;Yeah we control you, <em>and we want you to know about it &amp; be afraid of us</em>!&quot; is NOT something they&#39;d ever want. Why in hell would they? That makes their job 10 times harder &amp; more complicated. Especially when talking about Americans, with their concept of Freedom &amp; Liberty flowing in their very blood. Far more preferable to keep them focused on the grind &amp; various distractions. Buuut, then Snowden came along &amp; fucked that all up.</p>

<p>Really, for anyone who knows human nature, and how humans react to being blatantly controlled, especially by some big dumb bully who <em>wants</em> the sheep to all of a sudden notice the sheepdogs &amp; farmers?! Sorry, there is simply no logic to this argument. And no wall of text with shitloads of links is going to change that.</p>

<p>Look, Snowden took the narrative away from them, so this limited hangout BS is just one way to try to &#39;piss in the waters of truth&#39; so to speak. It&#39;s one of probably many tactics that has gone into effect to mitigate the damage done by this guy. </p>

<p>I call it &quot;the limited hangout theory&quot; for its overarching explanation, but its more like the leading hypothesis because of the minimal information that we have been exposed to. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been sitting on the fence for a while now, honestly trying to view this situation without any bias and hoping for future &quot;revelations&quot; to convince me that Snowden was a genuine whistle-blower (because the leaks kept showing up periodically). Prominent people that made me curious about the &quot;limited hangout&quot; idea were Webster Tarpley and Naomi wolf:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/06/18/309609/how-to-identify-cia-limited-hangout-op/">Tarpley&#39;s article</a></p>

<p><a href="http://naomiwolf.org/2013/06/my-creeping-concern-that-the-nsa-leaker-is-not-who-he-purports-to-be/">Wolf</a> </p>

<p>And <a href="http://publicconspiracy.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/rconspiracy-links-for-snowden-limited-hangout-op/">here&#39;s</a> a collection worth mentioning of other bloggers that someone gathered. (Edit: seems to be <a href="/u/ObeyTheCowGod">/u/ObeyTheCowGod</a>. Thanks for the links).</p>

<p>Their biggest argument was that we have only seen garbage revelations heretofore, which benefited the NSA and not the other way around. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t entirely convinced, so I looked into it. The best timeline of the &quot;leaks&quot; I&#39;ve found is <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/multimedia/timeline-edward-snowden-revelations.html">Al Jazeera&#39;s</a>. I don&#39;t think you need to doubt its validity, since it&#39;s a collection of mainstream articles anyway. </p>

<p>You can follow the timeline for yourself, and you would find that the most incriminating article is from <a href="http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/10/ministerio-das-minas-e-energia-esta-na-mira-de-espioes-americanos-e-canadenses.html">Globo</a> that showed how companies in Brazil were being spied on. The big catch? It&#39;s the only leak showing that it was perpetrated by the Canadian intelligence agency, not the NSA (besides monitoring Canadian citizens in airports). There is another one that tells us the NSA <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/how-the-nsa-and-gchq-spied-on-opec-a-932777.html">spied on OPEC</a>, a collection of <a href="http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/25.htm">Arab countries and Venezuela</a>, most of which have had their sovereignty compromised anyway. A worthless leak. Spying on Iraq is supposed to be big news after the entire country has been leveled to the ground?</p>

<p>Those who doubt the Snowden charade also say that the NSA&#39;s main motive is to make people aware of the fact that they&#39;re being monitored. Sort of like sending a clear message of &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot;. The diplomatic leaks fall under this category as well, but they also imply a serious threat to the nations&#39; autonomy, like intercepting the calls of Germany&#39;s Merkel. Nothing came of it, but people are now a tiny bit more accustomed to the idea of a one world government.</p>

<p>Besides these leaks, it&#39;s all garbage. Many were waiting for anything on 9/11, but all they got was that the NSA was pushing its spokespeople to promote the official 9/11 narrative, in order to <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/30/revealed-nsa-pushed911askeysoundbitetojustifysurveillance.html">to justify the program</a>. An idea so prevalent in society that it&#39;s used as satire in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YOh-rpvjYg&amp;amp;t=0m46s">cartoons</a>. </p>

<p>Some articles are even used as a mouthpiece for the NSA, like how <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-documents-detail-al-qaedas-efforts-to-fight-back-against-drones/2013/09/03/b83e7654-11c0-11e3-b630-36617ca6640f_story.html">&quot;Al Qaeda&quot; are trying to hijack the drones</a>. You should also know by now that anyone even using the words &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; is full of shit.</p>

<p>The spark that lit the fuse for me was the leak released today: <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/02/18/snowden-docs-reveal-covert-surveillance-and-pressure-tactics-aimed-at-wikileaks-and-its-supporters/">Wikileaks and other activist groups being monitored</a>, which by the way was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1y86j0/glenn_greenwald_topsecret_documents_from_the/">top post</a> in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> a while ago. The article clearly shows how the NSA was <strong>only</strong> targeting foreign activists like Anonymous. An organization that doesn&#39;t include domestic activists, as we all know. My BS-detector went haywire after that, which made me write this post. (Tarpley mentions Wikileaks as another limited hangout operation, which I&#39;m undecided about).</p>

<p>Another argument for it is that Snowden has received a lot of attention from the MSM. This only hints to him being controlled, it&#39;s not proof. But it still makes you consider why.</p>

<p>Does it mean that Greenwald is part of it as well? I have no idea. There is a possibility that he naively releases the leaks without being compromised. That&#39;s for you to decide, and I would love to hear your opinion on it. </p>

<p>If you feel like I&#39;ve made a factual error somewhere or want me to include anything of importance, please say so. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. </p>
