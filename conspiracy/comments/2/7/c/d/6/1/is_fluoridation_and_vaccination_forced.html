       Here's some food for thought if most of our food is unhealthy and is killing us along with what they put in the water as well as he crap they spray in the air there is no way of avoiding these problems. Here is where I make my point if there is no escape from the stuff they force upon us and in the end it kills/seriously harms you how is not killing the people in charge not considered self defence since they are killing you and there is now way to avoid it .

       Yes, it is forced to some extent, or at least it is made difficult to opt out (buying bottles water, applying for one of the vaccine exemptions).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I think it is probably for the best - fluoridation is successful in its goal of reducing cavities, although some regions prefer a different delivery method; vaccines have saved literally millions of lives and are an essential part of our current apparatus for combatting contagious diseases.

       I agree with vax, I don't agree with the bonding agent they use for the multi vax I believe is the problem. 
As for fluoride, I grew up in the country, on tank water. I have no problems with my teeth. Only .0001% of the fluoride actually touches your teeth. Why not brush your teeth more regularly if you are so worried? Why ingest it when it's not beneficial to the rest of your body?

       I'm not against vaccination, because you know stopping polio is a good thing. But I do have a more outlandish idea that additional unknown things in vaccines are used to alter brain chemistry
       <em>
        (specifically the pineal gland)
       </em>
       to a state where corrupting ideas
       <em>
        (greed, gluttony, materialism...etc)

       can be placed into consciousness with greater easy.

       Vaccination is not forced - consents must be signed in order to be vaccinated.  Hopefully soon states will get their act together and get rid of the bullshit philosophical, religious, and personal exemptions.  Thanks to the anti-vaccine movement, measles is again a problem.

       Here's what you need to know: vaccines are safe and effective.  There are mild side-effects like tenderness at site of injection and fever.  Serious side effects are extremely rare.  That's informed enough.  If you want to know more than that, go online and research valid sites such as the CDC, WHO, and NIH.  PERIOD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Questioning things over and over again, in the face of scientific research to the contrary, is not smart or intelligent, it's a waste of time.  Thankfully states are moving towards tightening up their exemptions so the anti-vaccine movement is becoming less and less dangerous.  The ironic thing is that they're a victim of their own doings.  It's because of them that almost-eradicated diseases are making a come back and because of that vaccine exemptions will be removed. :-)

       Paralysis and the Politics of Polio
      </p>
      <p>
       Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a contagious disease caused by a virus that may attack nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fever, headache, sore throat, vomiting are some of the milder symptoms, and some victims develop neurological complications and paralysis of one or more limbs or respiratory muscles. In severe cases it can be fatal, due to respiratory paralysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people mistakenly believe that polio usually leads to paralysis, but this isn't the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       95% of people exposed to the natural polio virus don't exhibit any symptoms, even under epidemic conditions, according to the Physicians'
      </p>
      <p>
       Desk Reference 2001 and Natural History of Infectious Disease by Sir
      </p>
      <p>
       Frank Macfarlane Burnet and David O. White.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wikipedia article on polio initially cites the figure as 90%, but elsewhere on the page the “asymptomatic” outcome of poliovirus infection is listed as 90%-95%. According to the source used for these statistics, “Up to 95% of all polio infections are inapparent or asymptomatic.”
      </p>
      <p>
       About 5% of infected people will experience mild symptoms such as a sore throat, stiff neck, headache, and fever—often diagnosed as a cold or flu. Muscular paralysis affects approximately one out of every 1,000 people who contract polio.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has lead some scientific researchers to conclude that the small percentage of people who do develop paralytic polio may be anatomically susceptible to the disease. The vast remainder of the population may be naturally immune to the polio virus. [Moskowitz, R.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Immunizations: the other side.” Mothering (Spring 1984):36]
Usually there is a full recovery from paralytic polio—it rarely is permanent. Only a small percentage of cases will experience residual paralysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many serious questions about what factors contribute to increasing an individual's susceptibility to serious adverse reactions to the polio virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several studies have demonstrated that injections, either for vaccines or antibiotics, increase susceptibility to polio. It's been known since the early 1900s that paralytic poliomyelitis can start at the site of an injection.
      </p>
      <p>
       When diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were introduced in the 1940s, cases of paralytic poliomyelitis skyrocketed. This was documented in Lancet and other medical journals.
McCloskey, BP. “The relation of prophylactic inoculations to the onset of poliomyelitis.” Lancet (April 18, 1950):659-63
      </p>
      <p>
       Geffen, DH “The incidence of paralysis occurring in London children within four weeks after immunization.” Med Officer 1950;83:137-40
      </p>
      <p>
       Martin, JK. “Local paralysis in children after injections.” Arch Dis Child 1950;25:1-14
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1949, the Medical Research Council in Great Britain set up a committee to investigate the matter and ultimately concluded that individuals are at increased risk of paralysis for 30 days following injections; injections alter the distribution of paralysis; and it did not matter whether the injections were subcutaneous or intramuscular.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1992, a study was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases that again confirmed these results after documenting an outbreak of polio in Oman that was linked to the DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) shot. They concluded that “injections are an important cause of provocative poliomyelitis.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1995, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study showing that children who received a single injection within one month after receiving a polio vaccine were 8 times more likely to contract polio than children who received no injections.
      </p>
      <p>
       The risk jumped 27-fold when children received up to nine injections...and with ten or more injections, the likelihood of developing polio was 182 times greater than expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why injections increase the risk of polio is unclear. Nevertheless, these studies and others indicate that “injections must be avoided in countries with endemic poliomyelitis.” Health authorities believe that all “unnecessary” injections should be avoided as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       A poor diet has been shown to raise one's susceptibility to polio.
In 1948, during the height of the polio epidemics, Dr. Benjamin Sandler, a nutritional expert at the Oteen Veterans' Hospital, documented a link between polio and an excessive use of sugars and starches.
      </p>
      <p>
       He compiled records showing that countries with the highest per capita consumption of sugar, such as the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and Sweden (with over 100 pounds per person per year) had the greatest incidence of polio. In contrast, polio was practically unheard of in China (with its sugar use of only 3 pounds per person per year).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandler claimed that sugars and starches lower blood sugar levels which leads to hypoglycemia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such food dehydrate the cells and leech calcium from the body. A serious calcium deficiency precedes polio. Researchers have always known that polio strikes with its greatest intensity during the hot summer months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Sandler observed that children consume greater amounts of ice cream, soft drinks, and artificially sweetened products in hot weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1949, before the polio season began, he warned the residents of 
North Carolina, through the newspapers and radio, to decrease their consumption of these products.
      </p>
      <p>
       That summer, North Carolinians reduced their intake of sugar by 90%; polio decreased by the same amount! The North Carolina State Health Department reported 2,498 cases of polio in 1948 and 229 cases in 1949. [Data taken from North Carolina State Health Department figures]
      </p>
      <p>
       One manufacturer shipped one million less gallons of ice cream during the first week alone following the publication of Dr. Sandler's anti-polio diet. Soft drink sales were down as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But powerful Rockefeller Milk Trust, which sold frozen products to North Carolinians, combined forces with soft drink business leaders and convinced the public that Sandler's findings were a myth and the polio figures a fluke. By the summer of 1950 sales were back to previous levels and polio cases returned to “normal.” [McBean, E., Allen, H.]
      </p>
      <p>
       As can be seen by this graph of United States polio rates, polio epidemics became a serious problem in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although it never quite reached the levels of 1916 (when the epicenter of the epidemic was mere miles from a Rockefeller research lab that was experimenting with an extremely virulent strain of the polio virus).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the early 1950s, Jonas Salk began experimenting with a possible polio vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1952, Salk combined three types of polio virus grown in cultures made from monkey kidneys. Using formaldehyde, he was able to “kill” or inactivate the viral matter so that it would trigger an antibody response without causing the disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1955, the first polio immunization campaign was launched in the United States. Almost immediately, it became clear that something was very wrong with the vaccine. In the end, 70,000 school children became seriously ill from Salk's vaccine—the infamous “Cutter Incident.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The mistake resulted in the production of 120,000 doses of polio vaccine that contained live polio virus. Of the children who received the vaccine, 40,000 developed abortive poliomyelitis. The Cutter incident was one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in U.S. history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The renowned surgeon Alton Ochsner even gave the vaccine to two of his grandchildren...one died and the other was paralyzed. “Apparently, Salk's killed-virus vaccine was not completely inactivated.”

       i live in australia.

      <p>
       each of my kids have been vaccinated, the most recent, was my 4 yo. this vax was different in that the GPnot only gave her the injections, he &amp; a nurse proceeded to do about 5 or so minutes of testing her-
      </p>
      <p>
       balance,
reflexes,
watch her riding a small bike,
reading,
other tests similar to these but also slightly different
      </p>
      <p>
       i asked him why, he kind of sheepishly looked at me and said "its a new procedure"
"for what exactly?" i asked. he said "well there has been some concern about side effects, this is just a small test that we have been asked to do"
when i asked why i couldnt get her vaccinations separate (not multiple-in-one injections) his only reply was "its perfectly safe, its perfectly safe" im sick of this bullshit, either the doctors need to be better informed or there has to be more options.

The effects have obviously spread to the individuals who the current and former powers that be have assigned to take the helm helm when they die.  With every class flag sham attack on America, they can't get any of them right.  Its unreal how detached they truly are.

       But your forgetting one major problem with vaccinations, they create diseases that are highly resistant to vaccinations and treatments. Personally I don't have a problem with them, I think that if somebody wants to put a "dead" virus in their body then that's their prerogative. I don't think that government should enforce any mandated treatments on the general public.
