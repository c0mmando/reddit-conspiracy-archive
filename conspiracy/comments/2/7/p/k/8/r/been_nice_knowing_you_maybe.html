      <p>
       This is long.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you with disabled attention spans, please feel free to move onto something else because the following diatribe will only annoy you. To those of you who DO read it... good luck, have fun (but hurry!). And yes, every thought, word, and idea you'll read here is marching across the horizon headed directly towards us as you read it... it's inexorable...
      </p>
      <p>
       My spoiler:: That an extremely rich (the wealthy elite class - so wealthy their names aren't known - you think you know who has the money, but you don't - Armand Hammer was the last of them who was public, and he's gone... sort of...),
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway,
      </p>
      <p>
       one of the wealthy elite is going crazy (not such a good thing when there are about ten of them who "own the world"). The others, kind of a balancing act like the separation of powers in the federal government, haven't noticed he's going crazy (much to the dismay of all us "little people"), and worse, they may applaud his crazy plan once they know of it, but they'll probably know of it after it's been hatched and they can't really do anything about it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, here it is...
      </p>
      <p>
       He, the crazy one, has decided that there are too many of us "peasants" hanging around and using up the earth's resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny aside: these guys got rich, in large part, by digging up things of the earth and selling them back to us, the inhabitants of the earth. The funny part: as inhabitants we have a 'natural right' to things of the earth - it's our home, but we've been sold the bill of goods that we have to pay for our homes. Money... such a funny concept when you really think about it...
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway...
      </p>
      <p>
       So the crazy one, who also happens to own about a tenth of everything (of the ten people who 'run' the planet), ALSO owns the means of producing the next plague... the plague that will be used, soon, to "clean off" about 95% of the world's population. As a side note, the wealthy elite  control the masses using religion and governments and food distribution and... you see, they're "long term/big picture guys so to speak, and they own EVERYTHING - as in all the businesses you see, all the land you're walking on, the oceans you swim in, the mines, the oil, the...
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh don't worry about the wealthy elite! They'll be taken care of - not all of us peasants are going to die, I mean, the wealthy elite will make sure they have a viably strong work force to do the “heavy lifting” while they continue to enjoy “life without strife”. The wealthiest people among us will be well cared for, don’t worry a bit about them! You see, they've been moving around populations now for a while in order to make sure the "means of production" and the “continuation of services” is being run by slaves. Oh sure, they don't seem like slaves, but slaves they are! Power, food, water, technicians, health, some scientists, pure labor... all slowly being taken over by what we can deem as slaves - people who will do what they're told and keep doing it with minimum protest. Here's a hint - white people, men, make lousy slaves - it's genetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slaves will account for the largest contingent of people left - robotics will help augment their ranks but as a discipline may be too late to actually do all the work that slaves will do best. Lets face it, slave labor has accomplished a lot in our short history as a "civilized" people, it’s tried and true: the trick is, you have to find the right slaves… and they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you've read this far, and it seriously doesn't matter if you put any faith in what I've just told you or not (won't stop what's coming even if you pray really REALLY hard), here's the final act...
      </p>
      <p>
       ((what's funny to me is how the book of revelations is to be interpreted - everybody going up to heaven (rapture) because they've been KILLED OFF and then the thousand years of peace for the rich people who remain... that's funny to me - there is SO much self fulfilling prophecy up and coming - I laugh... I cry!))
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, again, my spoiler is there will be no happy ending for us... the little people. Sure, make a sad face now. That’s the only thing you’ll do about it, if you do that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows, maybe the rich can avoid stagnation and go on to accomplish great things with what's left of the race. Maybe they have enough vision to keep from sliding back. True, almost all the genetic material will be gone, and I’m sure they think they’ve got that covered by holding “the best and brightest” in storage, and though they don’t realize it, that is an evolutionary dead end, but who knows? Perhaps things will work out for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had hoped, since I was a young lad, that all people would see there is no purpose behind what we do and realize that we, the "civilized" aspect humanity have zero purpose - we have no plan, no "well here we are, what are we going to do with it?" type of plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's odd too when you think about it, almost every parent of every person wants to shape how his or her child will be; what they will do; what they will become. But as a whole, we've got absolutely no idea what we should do with all this talent. Almost all individuals have a plan – may not be a good one, but a plan is in progress. Even NOT having a plan is a plan, in the overall sense, because something may happen that is good for me, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought, as a kid, we would start going to the stars, you know, spread out and go see what's here. There are riches beyond belief both inside and outside of earth's orbit. There is power there forever (sorry physicist types) and enough raw materials to last us well to 100,000 years from now...
      </p>
      <p>
       But we'll never make that. We'll never be a race with that kind of longevity, because we've got no vision. We like to squabble over cornstalks and kill each other over silver coins. Kids would be most likely to have a glimpse at doing a future that means something, but kid's dreams and thoughts are squashed and warped by the same adults who have given away their chances to "do something wonderful"...
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry. I rhapsodize...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, long story short - my spoiler... We're all going to die soon. There's no happy ending for us. There is likely no way to stop it at this point. This doesn't mean to go out and act like baboons doing whatever you like whenever you like. It simply means that we, as a race, have made a choice and it was a poor one. We chose money over future. We chose what we want for what's good for all of us. We chose to be led over equally leading. We chose the easy way over what’s hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       We chose to be singles instead of enmeshed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know how much longer we've got, but just to say, it's been great knowing some of you. Some of you, not so great, but for the most part it's been an interesting journey with many people and players who should have a future. And my kids. I’m sorry. I am so sorry. You all should have had a much better shot at life, but I messed it up and I apologize.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I'm just hoping that whatever they unleash, whatever "poison" they kill us with, doesn't hurt. That would suck - to lose AND to hurt real bad while it happened.

       Fear mongering a bit? It's not GG till your dead, even then you may even reincarnate back into this shit hole of a planet. As for the NWO things are not going all peachy as they desire, the Russians and the Chinese are breaking off and forming their own new world order, as for the Anglo kings of the NWO their almost all eugenicists, some even had certified Nazi training like the British royals which reinforces their current vision.

       No offense but people to often like to put the NWO on a pedestal, these people are not gods, their trust fund, inbred degenerate retards who control the money supply, these are not people who started off as us, they're certainly not elites in any meaning of the term, just flat out trust fund oligarchs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people threw out the bankers as Iceland did and told them to shove their debt its GG for the NWO banker scum and their Bilderberg minions. However almost no one knows about Iceland because the NWO degenerates absolutely fear such knowledge.

       So here's the thing I don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there the thought that the wealthy elite give two fucks about anyone less wealthy than they are? I mean, to the point of outright wanting to kill them?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're sitting at a computer reading this, you're probably better off than the majority of the earth's population.
      </p>
      <p>
       But are you sitting there thinking about how to kill those poor fucks in Ethiopia... or even in the slums in the nearest city to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you worried that they are somehow obtaining resources and, in the process, depriving you of the same resources?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, when I look at those poor fucks in Ethiopia or the slums, I know I can out-purchase them thousands of times over. If the question is of who's getting the food, I'll already get it before them. I just need to go buy it. I don't need to do anything nefarious to them to get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why do we think, or fear, that those more wealthy than us would think any differently about us than we do about the poor wretches in Ethiopia or the slums?

       That does not change the fact "de-population" (and eugenics) has been a common trend among globalists, CFR senior fellows, UN heads, and with the wealthy "elite" such (Bill Gates, Ted Turner, among others), and has been a common theme among self-proclaimed
       <em>
        New World Order
       </em>
       advocates (Kissinger, Bush, Brzezinski, etc.), as well as being explicitly outlined in the
       <em>
        Georgia Guidestones
       </em>
       (a monument constructed by the Rosecrucians detailing some of goals in the NWO agenda, at the request/order of Moriah).

       Isn't that de-population via lowering the birth rate though, as opposed to mass killings?

       De-population, in the long term, by any means necessary: lowering birth rates, by imposing one war after another to fulfill other agendas (depopulating any 'undesirable' populations with drone strikes, civil wars and depleted uranium munitions, for example, being only a 'bonus' effect for TPTB), with the spread of genetically-engineered pathogens and viruses, and with pervasive lifespan-limiting, hormone-disrupting toxins in our food, water and atmosphere, to name a few.

       If these families had money long enough, they would be spoiled and entitled. The only thing they can do is out-achieve each other. And yes, some may want to reduce the population so they can control it. If you had billions of dollars, they only thing left to do is become a god.

       Seriously now... I very much doubt that such a wide culling will take place, at least not intentionally. The ones at the top need a vast, diverse array of genetic material available for their dirty work, amusement, experimentation. And remember the bigger the masses, the easier they are to control, as long as you control the media, financial and religious entities.

       Just imagine how long would a clean-up of 95% of the population's carcasses would take. The plagues that would be unleashed, all the contaminated resources. I bet the stench would reach even the most secluded elites' hideaways in Bora Bora or their D.U.M.B.s in North America.

       Definately a long read dude.

       Anyhow, your whole premise is comprised of the idea that about ten people "own" most of the world (Thats all well and fine, though i think the actual number is considerably higher) and that only one of them went crazy (i tend to believe they are all knowingly complicit with whatevers going on) and they will try and kill of most of the people via plague.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont really think a biological attack on the entire world is feasible for those folks. In fact, i dont really subscribe to the idea that they want most people dead. Hear me out...

       Those wealthiest of wealthy people have a ridiculous amount of money and power. Ridiculous. But the thing is, they acquired their wealth through the banks. Debt drives their profits, and the bigger the population, the greater the debt that exists, the bigger their income.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be more logical for them to support overpopulation in pursuit of even more wealth, and eventually they will be the only ones able to afford to enjoy life. I think that is their goal here...

       I don't see how you forgot the machines. If something doesn't happen to overturn their applecart pretty soon, they won't need any slaves; whether black or white. And even the people who build and service the machines will only be temporary, until the machines can build and service themselves. But something
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       going to happen soon; it's why they are in such an all-fired hurry; you are here to be part of it, so learn your destiny and follow it. Take no technology into your body. They will make it necessary, like they did the cellphones; and make you feel like a luddite about it. But you will be glad you didn't.

       Have faith in Christ, which I believe to be an allegory to truth.  The lies and illusion will gets so heavy that it collapses and truth will rise. When the light of truth rises world wide these "elite" will run and hide like cockroaches.

       I believe most of the Bible to be allegory and not meant to be taken literally. The whole last supper and crucifixion is an obvious astronomy allegory.  I believe Christ to be an allegory to the positive side of the universe (truth, goodness, justice)....Yes those that try to interpret the allegories for others are just manipulating and controlling them.  As far as burned at the stake, that was Catholics which is fake Christianity and actually a continuation of the Roman empire. Everything they teach is in direct opposition from the Bible. Hence the beginning of the protestants.....Theology is a complex and interesting subject.  Most are very opposed to it because of lack of knowledge. It is like reading the old encrypted alchemy writings. It is all allegory.
