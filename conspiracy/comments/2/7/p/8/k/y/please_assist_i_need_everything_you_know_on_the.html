<p>No offense, but you have to trust someone at some point. It is extremely difficult to become an expert in one thing, it is impossible to be an expert in everything. We have no choice but to rely on others. Every time you take a plane trip you are trusting that Boeing&#39;s engineers knew what they were doing when the designed the plane, that the mechanics fixed it properly, that the pilot knows up from down, etc.</p>

<p>You have no choice but to trust <em>someone</em>, and that is why it is so damn easy to be swindled and taken advantage of by bad-guys. The only good option is to find experts you trust in real life (people you know personally, who live in your neighborhood, go to your grocery store, and send their kids to the same school yours go to), and ask their advice. Otherwise you go through life blind and that is almost certainly worse. You can try to do your own research, but you can&#39;t trust the sources of information any more than the people who wrote those sources, and surely you trust your local doctor more than some guy on the internet!?!</p>

<p>Saying &quot;<em>I am suspicious of the government and the partisan pro-vax and anti-vax movements</em>&quot; is healthy skepticism. Saying &quot;<em>every medical professional in my hometown is a quack or shill and I don&#39;t trust anyone</em>&quot; goes way beyond skepticism.</p>

<p>Good. There are charlatans and crooks under in every nook and cranny of this world. I certainly do not trust the drug companies, but I do trust <strong>my</strong> doctor. </p>

<p>Those who think that after a few hours online they are capable of evaluating a complex medical intervention like a vaccine as effectively as someone who has spent 11-15 years of their lives training are delusional, and those who don&#39;t implicitly trust that their own doctor has their best interest at heart need to find a new doctor ASAP!!!</p>

<p>There are many crappy quack doctors out there - those who try to sell you something on the side  (&quot;<em>I&#39;m afraid you need detoxification, luckily I sell terribly overpriced home-made detox pills!</em>&quot;), and those who allow themselves to be bought fancy dinners and given presents every other week by drug company reps (&quot;<em>sorry, but only this brand new non-generic drug will do in your case</em>&quot;) - but there are plenty of good doctors out there too! If you think your own doctor is incompetent or doesn&#39;t care about your well-being, find another one!</p>

<p>I would advise OP to find one he/she actually trusts, and ask said doctor. I would bet that the doctor not only accepts immunizations for himself/herself, but also immunizes his/her own children. If that is the case, OP must then ask him/herself, which of the three possibilities is most likely:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The doctor is such an idiot that with 11+ years of training he fell for a scam that airhead celebrities like Jenny McCarthy were clever enough to see through.</p></li>
<li><p>The doctor is such a corporate shill that he is willing to risk personal harm and poison his own children and his patients, just so that the prices of the stock he owns go up slightly.</p></li>
<li><p>The doctor is right: drug companies aren&#39;t particularly trustworthy and have troubling histories, vaccines occasionally cause nasty side-effects, but in general pose a far lower risk than the diseases themselves and are a good idea.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Since my doctor is my wife and I obviously trust her, I am operating on assumption #3.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have faith in the system, and I don&#39;t have the knowledge required to decide if vaccines are safe myself, but I do know enough to determine that my doctor is competent. So, I do have faith in my doctor (happens to be my wife). She, also doesn&#39;t have enough knowledge to decide if vaccines are safe, but she has enough to know which of her former professors and textbook authors are trustworthy. They probably still don&#39;t have the knowledge to decide if vaccines are safe, but they understand enough to determine which peer-reviewed papers are trustworthy enough to be included in their text-books and which are nonsense. This chain of trust goes all the way to the biochemists who designed the vaccines and toxicologists who decided they were safe.</p>

<p>I am depending on that chain of trust, as the only alternative is to go into this entirely blind based on my own shitty internet research. Even without this chain of trust, my doctor&#39;s understanding of immunology and toxicology is far superior to my own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On one side you&#39;re telling me these vaccines save lives, and on the other you&#39;re telling me these substances can cause cancer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Damn near everything is dangerous in the appropriate quantities. The question is not whether or not mercury can cause neurological problems, the answer to that is a very obvious &quot;yes&quot;, the question is, does thiomersal in vaccines break down into bio-available mercury at a level that would be dangerous!?! I have no idea, my doctor probably doesn&#39;t, nor do her professors, but the researchers (trusted by the professors, trusted by my doctor, trusted by me) doing studies examining the toxicology of thiomersal do have a good idea.</p>

<p>The state of modern science is such that we really have no choice but to trust the experts in their respective fields. We cannot possibly determine which airplane is safe to ride on, which encryption scheme used by SSL will protect your internet privacy, which cell phone battery might explode in your pocket, exactly what part of the drivetrain on your car is broken, which antibiotic is safe for human use, etc. </p>

<p>There are folks who would pull the wool over your eyes though, so it is just as dangerous to blindly follow as it is to try and make that decision unguided. Your best bet is to find someone who is an expert and whom you personally trust (hopefully your doctor!). Your goal in researching anything should not be to make the final determination yourself, but rather to learn enough to know who to trust and who to distrust.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way I see it, its not as easy a decision as you make it out to be. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think we can make the decision at all. The only real question is whether to trust our doctors, who spent 11-15 years at a university, or try and make the decision ourselves based on a few hours of reading internet posts. I think that one is a relatively easy decision!</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t implicitly trust that your doctor is both competent and has your best interests at heart, find another one ASAP!!! Some of my wife&#39;s peers seem like quacks, some sell bullcrap detox pills on the side, some allow pharmaceutical representatives to buy them dinner every week, some just don&#39;t care, but she is a good doctor and I am sure she is not alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I have a newborn and i <em>do not want to vaccinate her</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to be careful of the anti-vac movement. They seem to want to label all vaccines as bad, when some aren&#39;t at all harmful and some are downright helpful. (And, yes, <em>some</em> seem bad.)</p>

<p>I wish they would come out and publish which ones are bad and why, and which ones are ineffective but harmless, and which ones are good. But that isn&#39;t their agenda.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what their agenda is, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be completely benevolent.</p>

<p>So you really do need to do the research yourself.</p>

<p>Right off the top, <strong>Gardasil</strong> is ineffective at best and quite possibly harmful. But you won&#39;t have to worry about that for over a decade so moving on...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done some research into three ingredients in vaccines that the anti-vac movement calls bad.</p>

<p><strong>Thimerosal</strong> is a mercury-containing preservative that is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose to prevent contamination and growth of potentially harmful bacteria.  Think of Thimerosal containing mercury like salt contains chlorine.</p>

<p>But even if it were straight mercury, your child would get 1,900 times as much mercury eating just one 6oz can of tuna than through the vaccine. Yes, the gut filters some out. But not 1,900 times as much.</p>

<p>I would without a second thought let my kid have a vaccine that contains 0.3 micro-grams of Thimerosal if it protected against something I worried about. I think (though you should research this for yourself because I&#39;m not sure) that only influenza vaccines contain this stuff. I wouldn&#39;t vaccinate myself or my kid against influenza unless an existing medical condition put us at risk of it developing into something deadly.</p>

<p><strong>Formaldehyde</strong> is used to inactivate bacterial products for toxoid vaccines, (these are vaccines that use an inactive bacterial toxin to produce immunity.) It is also used to kill unwanted viruses and bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production. Most formaldehyde is removed from the vaccine before it is packaged.</p>

<p>Both your and your child&#39;s body make formaldehyde naturally. Many foods contain formaldehyde because they, too, make it naturally.</p>

<p>There is 120 times more formaldehyde in a single pear than in any of the vaccines that contain it. As with Thimerosal, yes, the gut protects you. But 120 times more? Sorry, not buying it.</p>

<p>As with Thimerosal, I would without a second thought let my kid have a vaccine that contains formaldehyde. Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.chop.edu/service/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/formaldehyde.html">a page</a> that lists them and the amount of formaldehyde in them. Notice there are some pretty nasty diseases on that list.</p>

<p>The final one I researched was <strong>aluminum</strong>. Here&#39;s what I wrote on that:</p>

<hr/>

<p>From <a href="http://www.chop.edu/export/download/pdfs/articles/vaccine-education-center/aluminum.pdf">http://www.chop.edu/export/download/pdfs/articles/vaccine-education-center/aluminum.pdf</a> (Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aluminum is present in vaccines that prevent hepatitis A, 
hepatitis B, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae 
type b, human papillomavirus and pneumococcus. Aluminum is not 
present in influenza vaccines, polio vaccines or live viral vaccines, 
such as those that prevent measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, 
shingles and rotavirus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes on to say...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the first 6 months of life, infants could receive about <strong>4 milligrams of aluminum from vaccines</strong>. That’s not very much: a milligram is one-thousandth of a gram and a gram is the weight of one-fifth of a teaspoon of water. <strong>During the same period, babies will also receive about 10 milligrams of aluminum in breast milk, about 40 milligrams in infant formula, or about 120 milligrams in soy-based formula.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a study from 1999 in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology &amp; Nutrition (<a href="http://journals.lww.com/jpgn/Abstract/1999/03000/Aluminum_Contents_of_Human_Milk,_Cow_s_Milk,_and.11.aspx">http://journals.lww.com/jpgn/Abstract/1999/03000/Aluminum_Contents_of_Human_Milk,_Cow_s_Milk,_and.11.aspx</a>) that says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mean aluminum concentration was lowest in human milk (23.4 ± 9.6 µg/l), and did not differ significantly between colostrum, intermediate-stage and mature-stage milk. Mean aluminum concentration was 70 µg/l in cow&#39;s milk, and 226 µg/l in reconstituted infant formulas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Per that last study, and focusing only on human milk (because it&#39;s best for babies), at 23.4 micro-grams per liter, would take baby 170 liters of mom&#39;s milk to get 4 milligrams of aluminum.</p>

<p>According to a popular nursing site (<a href="http://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/pumping/milkcalc/">http://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/pumping/milkcalc/</a>), babies can be expected to take in 750 mL per day through 6 months of age. 6 months = about 180 days = about 135 liters of milk.</p>

<p>Putting that all together now...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the first 6 months of life, infants could receive about <strong>4 milligrams of aluminum from vaccines</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK we&#39;ll take their word for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the same period, babies will also receive about 10 milligrams of aluminum in breast milk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Babies will drink 135 liters of breast milk in their first 6 months. That contains roughly 3 milligrams of aluminum. That statement seems false.</p>

<p>What might be worse, baby will get the 4mg of aluminum in 6 shots, not spread out over 6 months as they&#39;d get the aluminum from mother&#39;s milk.</p>

<p>Finally, baby will get the aluminum intravenously rather than orally and while I&#39;m not a big fan of saying the gut protects you from poisons (because arsenic and polonium and shit like that), it does offer <em>some</em> protection.</p>

<p>As always with vaccine articles, I&#39;m just trying to dig in, educate us, and put it into perspective.</p>

<p>Last time I did this, the original poster took down the article because I showed whatever was &quot;bad&quot; in that vaccine was dozens to hundreds of times worse in a pear. Formaldehyde, I think?</p>

<p>This time... there seems to be a much higher dose of aluminum in the vaccines than in mother&#39;s milk and it&#39;s coming in gangbusters to the blood stream rather than trickling in via the digestive system over many months. This seems dangerous enough to research further before doing. Saving this one for my daughter in case she ever gets around to making some grand-babies for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best suggestion is to ask the person who wants to give the vaccines which they want to give you/your child, then research which you will allow and on what timeframe, and which you may not.</p>

<p>I recently refused a Gardasil shot for cervical cancer for my pre teen kids.  It is not only completely offensive to suggest my kids need such an inoculation, but even the woman who created the vaccine said it was useless and I quote, &quot;the vaccine does more harm than the virus itself&quot;.  </p>

<p>It is a personal decision, and should remain such.  Still, there are government required vaccines that you must have to attend schools.  In those instances, speak to your Doctor about maybe staggering the shots out over multiple visits.</p>

<p>Here is my personal disclaimer:  I did almost none of what I am telling you.  My kids were given every shot ever prescribed to them when they were little.  They were sick more often than would seem normal, but they never get sick now.  So, maybe that is a trade off, because I also took every vaccine and got sick as a kid.  Now, I kiss my wife when she has walking pneumonia or the flu and I never get sick.</p>

<p>tl;dr  Vaccines are a good thing, just do your own research if you are worried about them and ask the doc questions, don&#39;t feel forced to make a decision on the spot.  Some ARE unnecessary and they are most definitely overprescribed, so do your research.</p>

<p>You quoted her completely out of context.</p>

<p><em>“If Gardasil is given to 11-year-olds and the vaccine does not last at least 15 years, then there is no benefit – and only risk – for the young girl.”</em></p>

<p>She was talking about the push to give it to pre-pubescent girls. The rest of the quote:</p>

<p><em>“This is what I tell students who come in asking about it, If someone is interested in dating and they are a sexually active individual, they are more likely to pick someone with HPV than without.”</em></p>

<p><em>“I guess if you look at cervical cancer as something that kills women ... a disease (for which) the treatment is the removal of the uterus (rendering) them infertile ... a vaccine that can prevent that ... from a community health standpoint, that’s huge,”</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Search for the post on this sub by <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>.  It&#39;s long but it goes into some of the nefarious history of vaccines and the people who create/profit from them.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say that <em>all</em> vaccines are bad or that the idea of vaccination is evil, just that we should always be vigilant and aware of what we&#39;re injecting into our bodies and those of our children.</p>

<p>Make sure you know exactly what&#39;s in the vaccines before giving them to your kids as well - if the doctor can&#39;t or won&#39;t provide the ingredients, that&#39;s a red flag.</p>
