What has Snowden or Glenn Greenwald said about any of this? Are they simply tools for the corporate-controlled media (which is a tool for the extreme rich) in order to maintain a wealth gap over us? Isn&#39;t it obvious now just how much we are being controlled?</p>

<p>TL;DR - The Snowden-Greenwald corporate media charade is a total distraction being pawned off as a 4th amendment issue (which is important to) when our gov&#39;t has had the resources to halt corruption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see exposing reality as peeling back layers of an onion. The Snowden-Greenwald narrative is one of the outer layers. People need to <em>get</em> what the NSA/CIA/FBI are doing before they can go deeper. </p>

<p>Sure is frustrating for those of us already half-way to the core though. And the longer this whole process of realization takes, the more locked down we&#39;ll be when all hell breaks loose.</p>

<p>If you check Greenwald&#39;s column at Salon or The Guardian you&#39;d see he talked about many of those subjects nonstop, particularly the lack of consequences for Wall St bankers and the banks that launder money for drug cartels</p>

<p>I get that you don&#39;t like Greenwald, but if you want to criticize him accurately you shouldn&#39;t attack him for not saying things that he, in fact, actually wrote about repeatedly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said &quot;what have they said about it?&quot;. I didn&#39;t say they were lying sacks of shit. I&#39;m not even saying what they said on the news is fake. What I am saying is that the media paints a picture in a certain manner that tends to side with a pro-gov&#39;t attitude. Again, my critique and main point of my post was to be critical of the manner in which the media has spun their story.</p>

<p>Then your feeling would be wrong in this case... Check my previous posts/comments. I think what they are doing is a good thing. I&#39;m sorry you felt like it was misleading when I simply asked a question.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll check that out. I also downloaded his book.</p>

<p>They are both alive and doing well. Greenwald is able to to travel into and through the U.S. They are pawns for someone. We need to find out who.</p>
