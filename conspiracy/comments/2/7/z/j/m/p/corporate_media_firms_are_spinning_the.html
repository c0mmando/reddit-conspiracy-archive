       ...prosecute corrupt bankers, drug cartels, wall street, politicians &amp; lobbyists,  international pedophile ring, pharmaceutical companies, abuse of illegal immigrants, large food processors, etc... What has Snowden or Glenn Greenwald said about any of this? Are they simply tools for the corporate-controlled media (which is a tool for the extreme rich) in order to maintain a wealth gap over us? Isn't it obvious now just how much we are being controlled?
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - The Snowden-Greenwald corporate media charade is a total distraction being pawned off as a 4th amendment issue (which is important to) when our gov't has had the resources to halt corruption.

       I see exposing reality as peeling back layers of an onion. The Snowden-Greenwald narrative is one of the outer layers. People need to
       <em>
        get
       </em>
       what the NSA/CIA/FBI are doing before they can go deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure is frustrating for those of us already half-way to the core though. And the longer this whole process of realization takes, the more locked down we'll be when all hell breaks loose.

      </p>
      <p>
       If you check Greenwald's column at Salon or The Guardian you'd see he talked about many of those subjects nonstop, particularly the lack of consequences for Wall St bankers and the banks that launder money for drug cartels
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that you don't like Greenwald, but if you want to criticize him accurately you shouldn't attack him for not saying things that he, in fact, actually wrote about repeatedly.

       I said "what have they said about it?". I didn't say they were lying sacks of shit. I'm not even saying what they said on the news is fake. What I am saying is that the media paints a picture in a certain manner that tends to side with a pro-gov't attitude. Again, my critique and main point of my post was to be critical of the manner in which the media has spun their story.

       The sad reality is: If Snowden and Greenwald were going to release anything that would disrupt the status quo and have it to go into chaos, they would be dead right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are both alive and doing well. Greenwald is able to to travel into and through the U.S. They are pawns for someone. We need to find out who.
