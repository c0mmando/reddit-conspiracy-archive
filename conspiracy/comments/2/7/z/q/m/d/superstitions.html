       Without going into specifics, we know that the moon has a huge effect on water, specifically our oceans and tides.  Humans are, what?  70% water?  So is it

       Some think there's an increase of positive ions during a full moon.  Ions are electrically charged atoms, and when they have a positive charge they can have a bad effect people's moods and health.  Negative ions make you feel good, and you can increase them by taking a shower or being in a natural setting near a waterfall out in the wilderness or going to the beach.

       You can search for that answer yourself.  I don't claim to be a scientist, but I've read several sources that state the possibility of negative and positive ions affecting human behavior.  To assume the human body and brain aren't influenced by electrical charges is foolish.

       The laws of nature and science are what create ions.  As wonderful and powerful as I am, I haven't gotten around to learning how to do that yet.

       There's a good chance they were making stuff up. There are so many issues with the theory, such as there not really being any evidence to back it up, and the fact that there are many other charges everywhere.

      <p>
       Ionization of the air : An abundance of negative condensation nuclei (“air ions”) in ingested air enhances alertness and exhilaration, while an excess of positive ions enhances drowsiness and depression. Calculation of the ionic balance of a target audience’s atmospheric environment will be correspondingly useful. Again this is a naturally-occurring condition - caused by such varying agents as solar ultraviolet light, lightning, and rapidly-moving water - rather than one which most be artificially created. (Detonation of nuclear weapons, however, will alter atmospheric ionization levels.) Cf. Soyke, Fred and Edmonds, Alan, The Ion Effect . New York: E.P. Dutton, 1977.

       What's ironic about attacking that particular source, is that it is a website advocating a skeptical position to such topics, and was cited in a Wikipedia entry regarding the pseudoscience of claims regarding the moon influencing human behavior. In regards to the full moons, while there is a
       <em>
        weak correlation
       </em>
       to suggest it
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       be possible, with positively charged ions being slightly more abundant during a full moon, and with positively charged ions having adverse affects on human mood and biochemistry in sufficient quantities, the quantity that is present during a full moon is substantially less than that required to produce such an effect. Any subjective affect would likely be the result of the human psyche, or a placebo affect, or perhaps a hypersensitivity to positively charged ions, though that would be a point of pure speculation. A common thunder storm would be more likely to produce an observable effect.

       Wolf experts say their howling has nothing to do with the moon; though it seems to me that the extra light would mean more effective hunting, thus more activity, which would lead to more instances of howling.

       Agreed. The moon's gravitational affect on Earth is constant, of course - its mass and distance from earth is doesn't change, irrespective of how illuminated it appears from Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, when the moon is full, as viewed from Earth, it is because it is directly opposite the sun. It is the alignment of sun, earth and moon (an astronomical phenomeon known as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_%28astronomy%29">
        syzygy
       </a>
       ) which creates the extra gravitational pull. This is why tides at full moon (and new moon) are stronger than at other times.

       I've actually always heard that the gravitational effect of the Sun &amp; Moon combine when the Moon is either full or new and have a greater effect on the tides, in particular.

       Does that being true (if it is) disprove the idea of the Moon having a greater effect when full than when not?

       Well, honestly, its just a pair-up of two uncommon instances (so to speak, a full moon is kind of uncommon if you think about the lunar cycle--full moons account for only 1/29th-ish of the time, and friday the 13th is an even more uncommon date. Put the two together and you get a much more rare occurance.)

       But, i will tell you i will be suspicious if any massacre happens tomorrow.

       Literally nothing you just said is actually legitimate science.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some think there's an increase of positive ions during a full moon.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How exactly would that work?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        when they have a positive charge they can have a bad effect people's moods and health
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This makes no sense, and nothing in modern science would agree with it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Negative ions make you feel good
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Same with this.

      <blockquote>

        you can increase them by taking a shower or being in a natural setting near a waterfall out in the wilderness or going to the beach.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So you can create ions out of thin air just by looking at a waterfall?
