        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why aren&#39;t we in the streets? There is plenty of clear evidence from reliable sources that Corporations have too much power in this country. We&#39;re raping other countries, stealing resources, collapsing nations, and destroying the planet. This is all verifiable. People all over the world are begging Americans to stand up to their masters. They don&#39;t understand why we aren&#39;t protesting. Why don&#39;t you (and if you know anybody who will join) go down to your closest college, or city square, and preach the truth. Hear me out. Maybe have a video running nearby (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j282JKnmeVo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j282JKnmeVo</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-25HOVRtaMk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-25HOVRtaMk</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOlg_2qAbUA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOlg_2qAbUA</a>) or some photos. Even if it&#39;s just you or a couple people, you could wake up a lot of people. If people agree that they are fed up, ask them to take a stand. Literally just gather in a crowd. Don&#39;t ask them to sign anything, march, or yell. Just gather. Why not make it fun? Invite artists to share their work, suggest that people have a picnic. If you can gain a crowd of some size then this could grow exponentially. A large crowd couldn&#39;t be ignored by the local media. It could inspire dissidence in others cities. With enough voice, we could call upon for an open forum debate. Ask intelligent political thinkers to gather and decide what needs to be done. Chris Hedges, Noam Chomsky, Ron Paul, grass roots parties, Glenn Greenwald. Even ask Obama, Clinton, Kerry, and Biden to come and defend themselves. Questions from the crowd. Violence or Illegal activity would not be tolerated, and anyone who engaged in criminal activity or used the crowd to incite a riot would be shunned from the Movement. All it takes is for you and your knowledge to go out and be that crazy guy on the street corner. It might not work...but it could! Isn&#39;t it worth it to at least try? What are you afraid of? I would stick to perspicuous and easily verifiable conspiracies. Don&#39;t get too out there and alienate your audience. Stick to the facts. And only the facts. People can&#39;t ignore you if everything makes sense. I think most people would agree to just stand around in a fun crowd, because I think enough are fed up. They just need someone who knows what they are talking about to take charge and lead the way. Stay calm, but be loud and proud. Don&#39;t be angry; people don&#39;t want to listen to someone who is angry. Show how this is a moral dilemma. Something anyone with a heart could subscribe to. Our thoughtless lives and docility to being obedient workers is ruining countless lives. Enough is enough. Please seriously consider this. With social media today, the ripple effect is a fast moving reality. YOU could be the start of major changes. I&#39;m going out Saturday.</p>

<p>Edit. Why all the negativity? Why isn&#39;t anyone stating the cities they live in so that they can coalesce and make a plan for how to present this to the public? Why doesn&#39;t anyone want to actually DO anything? It&#39;s close-minded and defeatist and it&#39;s self-fulfilling and just plain lazy, I&#39;m sorry. Why are your minds made up already? Why won&#39;t you at least try?</p>

<p>Edit 2. Please. These people need our help, not our loathing. Hatred destroys the vessel it&#39;s carried on, not the intended receiver: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAWMgYyAtHU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAWMgYyAtHU</a></p>

<p>Edit 3. Extremely disappointed by not only how defeated everyone is, but the complete lack of new ideas on how to bring this to people. You&#39;re all a part of the problem every single day you continue to not try. Everyone thinks they&#39;re so smart and loves to talk about it, but heaven forbid they have to leave their house or talk to people. (Quite a lot of projection, I know, but it still applies!)</p>

<p>Edit 4. Most people seem to be saying: Look how smart I am, because I already know this won&#39;t work. And not: I&#39;m too stupid to see the ironic herd mentality that is taking place here. I am relieving myself of the duties of waking people up because (I&#39;m too scared) I know it won&#39;t work, because I&#39;ve been conditioned to believe this. I honestly think that people are failing to read my entire post. I could be wrong, but it doesn&#39;t seem like people know how to read...</p>

<p>Well shit I&#39;m sorry folks: &quot;The more vast the gap between professed faith and acts of faith, the more vast our delusions about our own grandeur and importance; The more intolerant, aggressive, and dangerous we become.&quot;</p>

<p>TLDNR: Kill Yourself. Almost everybody seems to think I&#39;m saying go start a protest. I am not saying that. I am saying simply go out and set up information booths. Stop passerbys and tell them some cold hard facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a skeptic, I tend to wonder why there is such hostility by conspiracy theorists against bitcoin when basically what it is is nerds figured out how to do money better in the same sense that nerds figured out how to do long distance phone calls better when they came up with skype.</p>

<p>A decade from now, Bitcoin or something like it will probably be the world reserve currency. It wont be by choice of any government - they will have <em>no choice but to accept it as such</em>. Simply because its the invention of nerds who figured out how to more efficiently transmit value. I can send 80 transactions all over the world for combined fees of less than $1 usd. That has to mean something in this subreddit. You guys need to get behind this technology. You can help drive it forward.</p>

<p>That could be because you&#39;re not actually a &quot;skeptic&quot;, just a mainstream thinker who is averse to evidence which challenges their conventional world view.</p>

<p>Bitcoin was a brilliant invention, but it has created a Dutch Tulip mania for the 21st century. Thousands have already lost their shirts through hacking, fraudulent exchanges like MtGox, FBI confiscation and currency manipulators. Bitcoin is inherently unsafe and always will be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the doge. </p>

<p>I am not a supporter of the current fiat system at all. All currency systems have different drawbacks. The global fiat system is guaranteed to collapse at some point because too much worthless money has been printed (or clicked) into existence - there is too much debt to ever be paid back, and its getting worse.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are a great idea in principle, but they have different risks. They can&#39;t be printed to infinity, but since their value is so volatile, they are being used by speculators as a commodity. For a cryptocurrency to really become established, a mechanism has to be incorporated to makes its value stable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That mechanism, in my opinion, is the same as Fiat. Mass adoption of the currency. Hence, I spent everything I saved as a disabled guy for 2 years, change and birthday cash which I am severely fucking lucky to even get this many years into my adult life... A true sign of the terrible times... trading, buying, selling any sort of legal commodity I could, like I did as a child to perpetuate my paintball habit. Just so I could build a decent desktop/ mining rig. Now I have two desktop/mining rigs.</p>

<p>I am now barely even considered a &quot;Middle class shibe&quot;. Which, I know is entirely silly, but that&#39;s part of the point of the currency for me, to stop taking money so damn seriously... So I think the levity is a fantastically necessary addition to money.</p>

<p>I am continuing to mine to support the blockchain, and I&#39;m going to give more tips than I received. Because it was a few tips that got me into the entire thing. It is a powerful thing, rewarding people for educating and informing others. </p>

<p>So, yeah, there are risks, and there are speculators, but using that as a reason against adoption is like not using USD because a Forex market exists, and people take advantage of legal credit default swaps. Better is better. This is dial-up to broadband. Remember people on TV talking about e-mail in the 90&#39;s? Same deal. </p>

<p>Pushing for peace and prosperity, one moon bound Doge at a time! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your commitment, and wish you the best. I have been following bitcoin since the early days (&lt; $1) and would have made a packet if I had bought some. After accumulating some&quot;bits of a bitcoin&quot; I switched them into doge because I think it has more potential (in terms of % gains), but I haven&#39;t invested anything into cryptocurrencies thus far. </p>

<p>I think we both agree that fiat is toast. The key question is what comes next? There&#39;s a lot of uncertainty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of uncertainty. I like the Dogecoin community&#39;s sense of purpose. I think that a currency born outside of the silk road, on the clear net, with a message of caring and a focus on doing good things should be the one to fill the power vaccum that is going to be left behind by the implosion of the USD. </p>

<p>It&#39;s wishful thinking, but I would rather be hopeful and work towards positive change than do nothing at all and simply hope that it all gets better without having to do anything. </p>

<p>J- &quot;But, you said that he gave out this currency to people who spoke of non-violent protest to achieve change?&quot;</p>

<p>P- &quot;Yes, but he also said he wanted to destroy the power structure of the federal reserve, DESTROY your honor! That&#39;s violent.&quot;</p>

<p>J- &quot;And he intended to do this with an image of a doge and a made up currency based upon a cute dog meme? Looking through the testimony, it appears that he pretty accurately described flaws within our banking system and how they are exploited with impunity.&quot;</p>

<p>Im not trying to argue, im just trying to explain why im against it.</p>

<p>First if all, it can easily be hacked. Hell, it already was hacked several times. Not only that, but there is no reserve to back up the digital value. Also, its infrastructure relies on the internet heavily and full heartedly. An emp can knock all that out (natural or manmade). </p>

<p>Not only that, but a one world currency can be used as a segway to one world bank, one world constitution, and one world government (NWO). </p>

<p>Plus, why put so much faith into bitcoin when it has the same exact weakness as the original source of commerce?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a correct statement. I stated bitcoin has been hacked. Thats all i need to know to decide whether or not i will use it.</p>

<p>There is zero advantage to using bitcoin over credit cards. Zero. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You made an incorrect statement. Centralized exchanges where people go to trade national currencies for bitcoin have been hacked and people who have wallets on their computers have been hacked but the bitcoin itself has not been hacked. When an exchange is hacked and bitcoin are stolen that is the digital equivalent to a bank robbery. When a bank is robbed it has no effect on the underlying principles of how centralized planners move create and manipulate money. It doesn&#39;t change interest rates or reserve ratio requirements across the board.  If a cyber criminal hacks into Bank of America and manages to wire out a bunch of dollars that doesn&#39;t break the dollar. With bitcoin those hacks of places where people kept some bitcoins are the only hacks that have happened. Bitcoin itself wasn&#39;t &quot;hacked.&quot; MtGox wasn&#39;t bitcoin, it was more analogous to bank of america.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been plenty protests, plenty of coverage, and they either get infiltrated or the masses don&#39;t see them or wake up. There were quite a few big protests at the capital. The politicians saw all the people, didn&#39;t matter, business as usual. We&#39;ve lost representation in most politicians. The people on this subbredit know that, which is why we say what we say. </p>

<p>Not too mention, you have trigger happy police and &quot;free speach&quot; zones. What a scary ass joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, tell me, once you&#39;ve traveled a few hundred miles to go to rallies (like I have), and realize they don&#39;t care (the politicians see but don&#39;t care). I&#39;m for peace, I&#39;ve been to DC at least 5 times. The people don&#39;t care, they are complacent. I choose to inform those around me whom I love. I am making progress. To be blunt, fuck you for calling me lazy, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just not as naive as you to think you can &quot;wake everyone up&quot;. Do you&#39;re little meet ups, You will only attract those who care, for the rest, what&#39;s the Beibs doing? Awww, shit kardashian said what? Yea, fuck you. Don&#39;t ridicule us, because a lot of us &quot;been there&quot;, tried that. Fucking piss ant, sing coom by yah while you save the world, be a little more mature. The masses are ignorant and people don&#39;t give a shit. I sleep fine, with a couple beers at night, because I hope when I wake up, this will all just be a fucked up dream. Fuck you, fuck you&#39;re naivety, and fuck your condescending words. Most of all fuck this world, cuz shit is getting real, real quick. I&#39;m peaceful, and I share the knowledge I have, but shits a lost cause. All you have to do is look at the Romans, Rome is on fire, but we have sports, and social media :) .</p>

<p>Come in here thinking we are all just arm chair, lazy, commentators. This shit has been going on for a long time. We as a community have said this shit for a long time. People do not listen, or are just lying to them selves. There is a point in time where you say enough is enough. People don&#39;t care, that&#39;s why this community is jaded. Sorry to wreck your hopes and dreams. Be real, be honest, and this is the community. The US is dead. What happens next is any ones guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry </p>

<p>[Like many I point to a lack of militancy in our movement—a commitment of one’s entire being—personally, politically, emotionally &amp; physically—to the greater good. But I examined what action those beautiful words entailed, I exchanged “militancy” for the concept of “love ethic”—a distinction born of the belief that fights between “usses and thems” run counter to the collective “we”. “We” being human society with each person as an integral part—that must be seen, heard, felt &amp; loved—in order to transform the whole.</p>

<p>Like many, I found my beliefs easy to come by but difficult to act on. I always strived, but often struggled, to see, hear, feel, to love—even as I expected as much in return. I began to question, “If it is such a struggle to solidify amongst a few, how can we hope to strengthen love ethic across the many?”]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I share your sentiment. However, there has been many attempts at protesting, to no avail. We have (myself included) written our representatives many times, to no avail.</p>

<p>They are chosing to not listen to us.</p>

<p>Our founding fathers set forth a paradigm for us citizens during a time when we disagree with what tue federal government is doing. It starts of by written grievences, then formal protests.</p>

<p>Just like back in the 18th century, we have tried and tried to get our government to hear us out. And, just like in the 18th century, there are no tangible results. The final stage, dare i say, would be revolution. I dont believe we are there just yet, but more and more each day that seems to be the on way we can take back control of our country.</p>

<p>I think the onky way to avoid revolution is for the majority of our citizens, in unison, to take to the streets, peacefully. </p>

<p>But, therein lies a problem. It is incredibly difficult to amass such large numbers in any mesningful way in order to conduct such a scale of peaceful protest. Thus, i believe there is only the last resort left.</p>

<p>Until then, i will continue to address my grievences to my areas representative, and i will continue spreading the truth (not particularily about conspiracies, but the generalized notion that our federal government is out of control) until the time comes.</p>

<p>The problem literally is ignorance. Too many people chowing down on mcdonalds in front of the tv watching bachelorette or some shit, too preoccupied to look out their own window to see the world around them is changing for the worst...</p>

<p>I wonder if our founding fathers saw the same thing in their countrymen. In fact, i think they did. Lemme quote sam adams for a second:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If you love wealth more than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, depart from us in peace. We ask not your counsel nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you. May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen.”</p>

<p>– Samuel Adams</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maaybe you misread what i said. The time for formal protests has come already. There have been many attempts (some i did partake in). What you are pushing for is trite. Its been used up. Laughable (from TPTB and the ignoramuses&#39; point of view, not mine). Its been tried and hasnt work.</p>

<p>Same thing with written grievences and letters addressed to our representatives. I have written several times, personally. </p>

<p>What you are pushing for seems to be one final protest. Even against the precedence of historical (albeit recent) ineffectiveness that protests seem to garner. Im not against the idea. Though, from my experience, trying to get people to wake up has proven to be fruitless. The stubbornness of tbose who remain ignorant compounds this.</p>

<p>I still conduct conversations with those around me, slowly but surely inserting small tidbits there to make them curious enough to do their own research. Thats all we can do at this point, until we are all driven to revolt.</p>

I know our government is corrupt, I know they don&#39;t care about me or the education of my future children, and we&#39;ll probably be knee deep in another war by the time I am done typing this.  But you know what? I honestly just dont care anymore.  There are too many things to worry about in my life without trying to educate people who don&#39;t want hear it about 9/11, government corruption, and whatever other conspiracies there are.  What people need to focus on are Wolf-pac to reform campaign finance, and our education system. That is it.

OWS failed because it, like the TEA party movement, became compromised. They worked because they didn&#39;t have already idiot political figures heading them up. Once that happened, the legitimacy was lost. </p>

<p>Then the intrusions occurred where LEO actually posed as protesters and incited violence to the point of alleged rapes. How do you fight that which was born out of violence? Militias are powerless against the military armed with the NDAA. Obama signed executive orders giving him powers over just about everything in times of turmoil (he sidestepped the &#39;martial law&#39; declaration and just made an executive order).</p>

<p>So we stand around until we either get tased and arrested, pepper sprayed, or the movement works for a while until Sarah Palin gets elected as de facto leader and the whole thing gets associated with extreme right wing neocon nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were to go out and start talking to people, it wouldn&#39;t blow up into a huge OWS thing immediately, but it could wake up dozens and dozens of people. Don&#39;t you realize how that seemingly little action could have massive ripple effects? Why do you think you going out talking to people will get compromised immediately? Is it so you can say &#39;I know for certain it won&#39;t work&#39; and relieves yourself of the duty of going out and actually trying anything? Another defeated soul....there&#39;s an endless sea of you guys.....I need people who are willing to look at things from a new perspective and get off their asses.

<p>I don&#39;t mean to sound defeatist, or even that I have given up - I haven&#39;t. But I find it extremely difficult; and maybe it&#39;s because I live in San Antonio and no one here seriously gives a fuck, at least in the social circles I have encountered.</p>

<p>Anyways, thanks for the honesty.. It does help me as I can take criticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow, yeah, that&#39;s one tough spot for sure (being serious here). But I think if you find a way to make it relatable to them. Show them how this effects their lives, how it&#39;s ruining any future their children may have. Make it pack an emotional punch, and don&#39;t sugar coat reality. When people are hit with this all at once it must have some effect. You&#39;re not asking them to sign anything, march, or yell. Just gather in a crowd that has agreed that they are fed up. Protests can be fun! Let them do whatever legal activities they want. I think if you found even one other person to go out with you it would ease the anxiety of actually going out and doing something, which is undoubtedly nerve-wracking. You could make more of a difference than you might imagine. Word spreads, and people like parties. It&#39;s a numbers game though, and you have over 1 million people in your city. I know it&#39;s scary to try, but isn&#39;t the future we create by inaction even scarier?</p>

Essentially to garner attention, if you have enough people refuse to go to work it starts to gain attention rather quickly.

    <div class="md"><p>No, I am not talking about denial. You see, wanting to change the world in a drastic manner will only pass you off as being crazy, and most people don&#39;t even care. Seriously.</p>

<p>The attitude I am talking about is covered in the following podcast by 2 activists I respect very much. It is not denial, it is taking care of yourself first, to inspire others to do the same. For example, growing your own food, trade commodities so as not to be dependent on all the garbage and GMO&#39;s they sell in supermarkets.</p>

<p>Being free now is possible, and it does involve changing anything in the world. It means concentrating your efforts on the only thing that matters: you and those you hold dear.</p>

<p>To put it another way, our civilisation as we know it is changing. Structures are falling apart, and it does not look pretty from afar. But ... many civilisations have collapsed in the past, only to be replaced by something better, and greater.  Roman Empire collapsed, and the people then must of thought it was bad, but then OUR empire was built on top of that. We had a good time for a while, and now it is going down.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on trying to save a ship that is doomed, why not prepare for the next empire that will be built on top of ours? Start building today the upcoming empire.  If you have success doing this, it will certainly inspire others ( just as I have been inspired ). THinking this way seems to me a lot more constructive and bring up a lot less bad blood and emotions.</p>

<p>Here are 2 very cool podcasts that go into more details on this exact subject, these actually present solutions to the problems that are troubling you.  In no way is this denial, rest assured.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-146-lessons-in-resistance-building-communities/">http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-146-lessons-in-resistance-building-communities/</a></p>

<p>Remember, if you spend a lot of time feeling enraged and powerless against a big &quot;machine&quot;, thinking only of conspirations ... &quot;they&quot; win, and you lose out on the enjoyment your life is supposed to bring you.</p>

<p>You will realise, in time as I did that most people don&#39;t care. You will realise most people are not up to letting go of a little bit of their well-being (possessions, money ) to help others.  The masses are self-entitled, egoistical superficial sheeps that follow and repeat whatever bleached mainstream <del>information</del> propaganda they are bombarded with.</p>

<p>So you are upset about the poors in Africa? You will realise most others are more interested on what the IPhone 6 is going to be like, or Nintendo games. Trying to clue in these people hard facts of life will at best get you blank stares, at worst it will alienate you. It takes a lot of time and patience to open the eyes of just one person. I suggest you listen to the corbett podcast &quot;how to talk to people&quot;, you will understand what you are up against.</p>

<p>Look at the history of protests against corporate power, the most famous recent example would seem to me to be the occupy wall street movement, although that was not EXPLICITLY anti corporate since it was not explicitly anti anything.</p>

<p>When you organize a movement you don&#39;t get &quot;regular folk,&quot; you get the motivated minority, who tend to be the people with the most hard-line views and entrenched interest. You don&#39;t wake up a population all at once, some people are already predisposed to any given movement by pre-existing interests, and they will be the first and loudest, and they define your movement for you, and it wont be the way you want. I&#39;m sure there were smart motivated people with common sense who wanted to see the occupy wall street movement work, but all of that got sidetracked when the base turned out to be a bunch of weird hippies.

<p>You learn fast, but next you will need to adapt your plan to your new info. How can a base be a benefit. </p>

<p>All movements have bases, whether they want them or not, who is yours? how will you appeal to them? what are their benefits to the cause and also their liabilities?</p>

<p>Or if there is a base you want to avoid, how will you deflect them from the cause?</p>

<p>This is your hidden support base among the regular folk. They have their worn interests that cause them to be so passionate, and those passions will come to shape the movement, because they will quickly become the face of it.</p>

<p>The people who are successful at what you want to do are people like Snowden, but he had access to new and important information. </p>

<p>People aren&#39;t going to suddenly take an interest in a YouTube video that has been around since 2008.</p>

<p>Here is essentially what I am saying to you, there are two ways to effect change: start a movement or reveal a new and important truth. Both are incredibly unlikely to succeed, but not impossible.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t know your specifics, but I don&#39;t think my situation or the world at large is a hellish nightmare or likely to be one in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Hell we live in an information age. Think about just 50 years ago how people had to get information. ALL they had was media and maybe word of mouth. </p>

<p>Now look at the spread of information today. Look at the syrian civil war being organized through facebook and twitter. Look at how we are talking right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not taking to the streets is not being defeated. And maybe my means are more humble than yours, but also perhaps my goals are more realistic and achievable. </p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m not looking to start a movement. Also, if I did you would not be on board with it probably since you and I, and everyone else in this subreddit, will disagree on SOMETHING. </p>

<p>I, for instance, do not think 9-11 was an inside job. Other conspiracies seem much more concrete and realistic to me. But I&#39;m sure if you drew up your list of your top 10 conspiracies everyone should rally behind here, practically no one would agree with them all. That is the nature of conspiracies.</p>

<p>But ask yourself this, if you look around and say &quot;NO ONE HERE HAS ANY EMPATHY, WHY CANT THEY FEEL WHAT I AM FEELING??&quot; is that a problem with everyone else? or a problem with you? </p>

<p>which is more likely?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine if the Tea Party (the real one, started by Ron Paul supporters) and Occupy came together on the issues they agree on, and started there.</p>

<p>This was <a href="http://www.ronpaul.com/ronpaul08/events/ron-paul-press-conference/">put together</a> by Ron Paul, Ralph Nader, and Cynthia McKinney in 2008:</p>

<p><strong>Foreign Policy</strong>: The Iraq War must end as quickly as possible with removal of all our soldiers from the region. We must initiate the return of our soldiers from around the world, including Korea, Japan, Europe and the entire Middle East. We must cease the war propaganda, threats of a blockade and plans for attacks on Iran, nor should we re-ignite the cold war with Russia over Georgia. We must be willing to talk to all countries and offer friendship and trade and travel to all who are willing. We must take off the table the threat of a nuclear first strike against all nations.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy</strong>: We must protect the privacy and civil liberties of all persons under US jurisdiction. We must repeal or radically change the Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, and the FISA legislation. We must reject the notion and practice of torture, eliminations of habeas corpus, secret tribunals, and secret prisons. We must deny immunity for corporations that spy willingly on the people for the benefit of the government. We must reject the unitary presidency, the illegal use of signing statements and excessive use of executive orders.</p>

<p><strong>The National Debt</strong>: We believe that there should be no increase in the national debt. The burden of debt placed on the next generation is unjust and already threatening our economy and the value of our dollar. We must pay our bills as we go along and not unfairly place this burden on a future generation.</p>

<p><strong>The Federal Reserve</strong>: We seek a thorough investigation, evaluation and audit of the Federal Reserve System and its cozy relationships with the banking, corporate, and other financial institutions. The arbitrary power to create money and credit out of thin air behind closed doors for the benefit of commercial interests must be ended. There should be no taxpayer bailouts of corporations and no corporate subsidies. Corporations should be aggressively prosecuted for their crimes and frauds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry </p>

<p>[Like many I point to a lack of militancy in our movement—a commitment of one’s entire being—personally, politically, emotionally &amp; physically—to the greater good. But I examined what action those beautiful words entailed, I exchanged “militancy” for the concept of “love ethic”—a distinction born of the belief that fights between “usses and thems” run counter to the collective “we”. “We” being human society with each person as an integral part—that must be seen, heard, felt &amp; loved—in order to transform the whole.</p>

<p>Like many, I found my beliefs easy to come by but difficult to act on. I always strived, but often struggled, to see, hear, feel, to love—even as I expected as much in return. I began to question, “If it is such a struggle to solidify amongst a few, how can we hope to strengthen love ethic across the many?”]</p>
