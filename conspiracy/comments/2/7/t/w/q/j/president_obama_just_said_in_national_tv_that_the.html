<p>Sorry, paraphrasing from my terrible short term memory and I&#39;m on my phone, otherwise I&#39;d look for a transcript. Someone else can post it for that sweet sweet karma.</p>

<p>Did anyone else just see that? I predict Alex Jones screaming about it with a vein in his forehead about to burst in 3, 2, 1...</p>

<p>President Obama stated, when describing the difference between the number of shootings in the US and other countries: &quot;What&#39;s the difference? These guys can stack up a bunch of ammunition in their houses and that&#39;s sort of par for the course.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much thanks, my first doge tip ;)</p>

<p>The upset of Eric Cantor in the GOP primary shows how upset people are across the board.  His campaign got hijacked by anti-immigration nuts, but it started as a fiscally responsible, libertarian, anti wall street crony capitalism and big business in government.</p>

<p>If only the Tea party and Occupy would realize that if they forgot the other things they disagreed on, focused on corruption, wall street, banks, and campaign finance... we could have democracy again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m feeling very optimistic in general right now. I think that the <strong>global</strong> financial system is going to change. </p>

<p>It&#39;s time we stop abusing money. It&#39;s worse than alcohol. </p>

<p>Bitcoin is apparently being positioned to be the new reserve currency, as evidenced by the massive civil forfeitures in multiple countries. The governments are trying to get a hold of enough of the currency to use it for leverage, hence the massive value increase. The silk road seizure and the mt. Gox debacle... </p>

<p>If our current governments are hoarding bitcoins, then I think that I will put my weight behind doge! If money is the root of all evil, I choose the least evil money I can find. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>heh, that&#39;s a good slogan for the future (the now future) when money isn&#39;t tied to nations economies, but ideologies, organizations, corporations.... choose the least evil money.. and don&#39;t invest in evil money that promises short returns.</p>

<p>That&#39;s our job for now, convince them to be ready that whenever a huge change comes around the corner and they&#39;ll be disagreeing, politics will no longer help to comply with what the gov has to say.</p>

<p>The way I figure it, the best way to stop the war machine is by defunding it. If we cannot do that without being thrown in jail for tax evasion, we start trading our own electronic commodities. Peaceful resistance. And the dogecoin group has got to be the least threatening public image for the movement. It is the one that will succeed. We already sponsored graphics on a Nascar, and we have active charities. </p>

<p>Such does indeed seem to be the case.  I would not disagree with that.</p>

<p>It seems to be a weird, chicken-or-the-egg scenario where, as you mentioned here, a lot of times we sit and <em>wait</em> for &quot;more to be done&quot; for &quot;more people to wake up&quot; first.  We might end up waiting all day for that and end up going nowhere.</p>

<p>We have to at least <em>begin</em> to inch forward bit by bit even if we don&#39;t see anyone else doing it and it seems we&#39;re alone and by ourselves doing it.  If we inch forward bit by bit, then we can move forward in a slow enough manner to get others to eventually catch on, see what someone else (you) is doing, and slowly join in as well.</p>

<p>No one is going to show up at your door wearing black uniforms and gas masks to take you and your kids away in a dramatic scene.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a slow and steady decline in the value of your wealth. The only reason they had to ramp up in the last few years is because of how successful the internet has been in exposing the puppet show, with net neutrality gone, internet access monopolized to a few companies (for the major part), and swaths of people getting paid to argue pro status-quo online, this episode of attainable enlightenment will soon pass, if it has not already done so.</p>

<p>Your children will be waiting for things to change, or for the shit to hit the fan, just as you are. And while you wait, fortunes are amassed, monuments built to praise the oppressors, their influence over the monkey see monkey do crowds grows every day, and people, being unorganized as they are, will just keep their place in line with their fingers crossed, just like you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Usually they want a registry for ammo purchases, like what they do with pseudoephedrine now.  That way gun owners can live in (a very real) fear that the government knows what you have in case they get the power to disarm you.  This is the same for states with weapon registration, if you are deemed no longer able to legally have guns they will come break down your door for them.</p>

<p>President Obama stated, when describing the difference between the number of shootings in the US and other countries: &quot;What&#39;s the difference? These guys can stack up a bunch of ammunition in their houses and that&#39;s sort of par for the course.&quot;</p>

<p>The difference is not the ability to <em>stack up ammunition</em>, it&#39;s the cultural differences. To say it&#39;s something as simple as controlling the ammo is simpleminded and elementary. I would have hoped the President would have been able to understand that. </p>

<p>But I think if people were sincere about that they would take a long hard look at the fact that the Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis, Fort Hood shooter Ivan Lopez, Aurora Colorado movie theater shooter, James Holmes, Seattle Pacific University shooter Aaron Ybarra, Columbine shooters Eric Harris and his accomplice, Dylan Klebold (Harris on drugs, Klebold&#39;s records were sealed) those people were all taking SSRIs. </p>

<p>Did you know the medical examiner&#39;s office is being sued to release Adam Lanza&#39;s toxicology report and medical history? I wonder what that will show? How long until we find out one or both of the Las Vegas shooters were on something?</p>

<p>The real conspiracy here is between the FDA, the pharmaceutical industry and doctors that are turning troubled people that could be helped into mass murderers by prescribing medication that is known to cause suicidal and violent thoughts without any regiment of close observation for signs of potential violent tendencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I poke a little fun at Alex Jones? Why so serious?</p>

<p>To answer your question: No, not really. I&#39;m a gun owner, so it would suck for people like me that don&#39;t pose a threat to others. I don&#39;t mean it would suck like I have a problem jumping through hoops. Where I live you have to have background check and take a class to have a handgun anyway. I would expect a run on ammunition and prices would go up. Plus, if I go to the range I can run through 500 rounds in no time at all. That&#39;s why it would suck. </p>

<p>I just figured this is relevant for the sub and conspiracy theories regarding false flags as a means to gun control. I see it more of a media conspiracy to drive the issue as opposed to false flags. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are misinterpreting that. In 1780, &quot;well regulated&quot; meant &quot;smoothly running&quot; not legal red tape. The modern definition of &quot;regulated&quot; is very different. You can search other documents that were written around the same time period to understand the intended meaning of this phrase:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.constitution.org/cons/wellregu.htm">http://www.constitution.org/cons/wellregu.htm</a></p>

<p>This graphic might also help you to better understand it:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YO26zkE.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/YO26zkE.jpg</a></p>

<p>There are also many other historical documents (besides the Bill of Rights) where the founding fathers wrote about their feelings on the Second Amendment. Here&#39;s what Samuel Adams had to say:</p>

<p><em>“The said constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.”</em></p>

<p>No, basically it&#39;s human problems. Apparently it&#39;s American problem, to you.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are 87% like America, time to stop pretending Canada is safe/better then America by default because Canadians want to feel better. Look at Canada, it&#39;s utter shit now, but since most Canadians are indoctrinated and naive you can&#39;t see how deep in shit you are. Instead you compare yourself to the worst of USA so you can pat yourself on the back. Grow the fuck up Canada. Start by burning the Queen, that german poser hag. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paunchy&#39;s quote is hyperbolic and fails to persuade, but it&#39;s not much of a reach. </p>

<p>I voted for this President and believed in what he stood for.  But if he is part of a line of puppets employed by a secret society - of the like Kennedy spoke against and a good many of those in this subreddit believe exist - then paunchy isn&#39;t far off.  Stalin and Hitler just achieved greater numbers of lives lost.  </p>

<p>Our leaders started a war on a gambit for profit and global dominance - apparently helped along by a false flag attack - that killed a million in Iraq alone, while all the while curtailing our rights at home. </p>

<p>If Obama is complicit, or a co-conspirator in this - which he does appear to be - then he should be assailed.  But, I agree, Paunchy does need some help; something like an expressive writing course may help him be a little more persuasive when making his arguments.</p>

<p>Edit:  In the light of the recent events pertaining to the news of hateriots and their desires for violent insurrection, just to be clear, I believe all change must come from democratic and nonviolent means.</p>

<p>I voted ffor him twice and although he has done many, many good things he has also failed to reign in the unrestrained transfer of wealth to the 1%.</p>

<p>I also have zero desire for any American violence and hope for real Democracy and it has to from nonviolent means. </p>

<p>While he was campaigning, I, like many others, felt the sincerity of his convictions.  He&#39;s either a diagnosable sociopath, or a poor schmuck in way over his head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe Americans are too stupid to be allowed to handle guns... I mean there&#39;s a school shooting every other day.</p>

<p>No doubt it&#39;s because of whackos who put forth this bizarre idea that guns have no consequences. The real reason all of this is happening is because of pro-gun nuts.</p>

<p>The NRA, and gun nuts refuse to be reasonable, and because of that, they created a huge imbalance where there are more guns than reasonable gun owners. </p>

<p>Oh and I hate to tell you, if the military or the government came after citizens, guns wouldn&#39;t do jack shit. They have weapons that can implode someones brain using a sound.. do you really think your shotgun is going to stop that? Or a drone? Or some other weapons we don&#39;t even know about? </p>

<p>Guns should only be obtained by those who have met certain requirements and are reasonably trained in using them. This fantasy of an armed revolution can no longer take place, guns are not going to save you from the government.</p>
