       </a>

      <p>
       <strong>
        Does Snowden even have documents which contain the information which you’ve seen?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       RUSSELL TICE:  The answer is no.
      </p>
      <p>
       WASHINGTON’S BLOG: So you saw handwritten notes. And what Snowden was seeing were electronic files …?
      </p>
      <p>
       RUSSELL TICE: Think of it this way.  Remember I told you about the NSA doing everything they could to make sure that the information from 40 years ago – from spying on Frank Church and Lord knows how many other Congressman that they were spying on – was hidden?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Now do you think they’re going to put that information into Powerpoint slides that are easy to explain to everybody what they’re doing?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They would not even put their own NSA designators on the reports [so that no one would know that] it came from the NSA.  They made the reports look like they were Humint (human intelligence) reports.  They did it to hide the fact that they were NSA and they were doing the collection.
       <strong>
        That’s 40 years ago.
       </strong>
       [The NSA and other agencies are still doing "parallel construction", "laundering" information to hide the fact that the information is actually from mass NSA surveillance.]
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what NSA is doing right now is that they’re taking the information and they’re putting it in a much higher security level.  It’s called “ECI” - Exceptionally Controlled Information  – and it’s called the black program … which I was a specialist in, by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I specialized in black world – DOD and IC (Intelligence Community) – programs, operations and missions … in “VRKs”, “ECIs”, and “SAPs”, “STOs”.   SAP equals Special Access Program.
       <strong>
        It’s highly unlikely Mr. Snowden had any access to these.
       </strong>
       STO equals Special Technical Operations.
       <strong>
        It’s highly unlikely Mr. Snowden had any access to these.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now in that world – the ECI/VRK world – everything in that system is classified at a higher level and it has its own computer systems that house it.  It’s totally separate than the system which Mr. Snowden was privy to, which was called the “JWICS”: Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System.  The JWICS system is what everybody at NSA has access to.  Mr Snowden had Sys Admin [systems administrator] authority for the JWICS.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you still have to have TS/SCI clearance [i.e. Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmented Information - also known as “code word” - clearance] to get on the JWICS.  But the ECI/VRK systems are much higher [levels of special compartmentalized clearance] than the JWICS.  And you have to be in the black world to get that [clearance].
      </p>
      <p>
       ECI = Exceptionally Controlled Information.
       <strong>
        I do not believe Mr. Snowden had any access to these ECI controlled networks)
       </strong>
       .   VRK = Very Restricted Knowledge.
       <strong>
        I do not believe
       </strong>
       Mr. Snowden had any access to these VRK controlled networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s very compartmentalized and – even with stuff that they had – you might have something at NSA, that there’s literally 40 people at NSA that know that it’s going on in the entire agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        When the stuff came out in the New York Times [the first big spying story, which broke in 2005
       </strong>
       ] – and I was a source of information for the New York Times –   that’s when President Bush made up that nonsense about the “terrorist surveillance program.”  By the way, that never existed. That was made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no such thing beforehand.
       <strong>
        It was made up … to try to placate the American people.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA IG (Inspector General) – who was not cleared for this – all of a sudden is told he has to do an investigation on this; something he has no information or knowledge of.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what they did, is they took a few documents and they downgraded [the classification level of the documents] – just a few – and gave them to them to placate this basic whitewash investigation.
      </p>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <p>
       RUSSELL TICE: If Mr. Snowden would have had access to VRK, ECI, SAP, STO (and a few others that I will not mention here), and he released them en masse to the press,
       <strong>
        I would volunteer to shoot him as a traitor myself.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is not what he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gave up JWICS info that he insisted be vetted for sources and methods, and true damage to national security.
       <strong>
        Mr. Greenwald and company should be congratulated on the restraint that they have shown with the JWICS documentation that they have in hand via Mr. Snowden.

       <p>
        In unveiling new Edward Snowden revelations about NSA spying, the Washington Post has once again whitewashed the fact that the content of
        <strong>
         all our communications have been stored and analyzed under the Echelon program since the 1990′s.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        This notion that the NSA just accidentally happens to record the locations of Americans using data from their cellphones, and is not deliberately engaging in domestic surveillance, is yet another example of damage control by the establishment.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/503224.stm">
         In 1999, the Australian government admitted that they were part of an NSA-led global intercept and surveillance program called Echelon in alliance with the US and Britain that could listen to “every international telephone call, fax, e-mail, or radio transmission,” on the planet.
        </a>

         In addition, a 2001 European Parliament report stated that “within Europe all e-mail, telephone and fax communications are routinely intercepted” by the NSA.

        Binney’s revelations were far more hardcore than anything Edward Snowden released yet he was

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Edward Snowden’s leaks and scandals can be explained as
        <strong>
         a highly sophisticated, disinformation project of the highest order.
        </strong>
        Disinformation being defined as false information deliberately, and covertly, spread in order
        <strong>
         to influence public opinion
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Snowden has told us that the NSA is spying on emails and telephone calls (Drury and Robinson, 2013), along with revelations that international super powers spy on one another (Chen, 2013). While this may be shocking to some, these revelations can hardly be detailed as ‘new’ or ‘ground-breaking’. Snowden has simply provided a name, PRISM, for what has already been understood to be going on for some time.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also interesting to note that these limited hangout actors have themselves participated in the attacking of 9/11 truth activists. *
        <em>
         Assange has provided the most scolding attack stating ‘I’m constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11’ *
        </em>
        (Bell, 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Glenn Greenwald, who brought Snowden forward, is not interested in veering from the official 9/11 story and instead focuses on ‘blowback’ being the cause of terrorism (Greenwald, 2013)
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         It must be asked why these ‘whistle-blowers’ seem so vehemently opposed to the issue of questioning the biggest elephant in the room per say – 9/11
        </strong>
        , and why they never have any new information to reveal regarding the event. They all appear to agree with the establishment, that they proclaim to be fighting against, on what is arguable
        <strong>
         the most important and controversial event in recent history
        </strong>
        ; which provides much cause for concern.
       </p>
       <p>
        Naomi Wolf (2013) has stated that during his interview he looked like ‘someone who had
        <strong>
         learned his talking points’
        </strong>
        and
        <strong>
         his message promoted fears that an oppressive government would want to instill in other would-be whistle-blowers
        </strong>
        ; such as the idea that you will lose everything by standing up against it, in effect, demonstrating the omnipotent capacity of said government.
       </p>
       <p>
        One can also judge a man by the company he keeps and in Snowden’s case that means Wikileaks (Shane and Savage, 2013). Before shooting into mainstream fame, Wikileaks received an endorsement from
        <strong>
         Cass Sunstein
        </strong>
        suggesting that ‘they have immense potential’ (Sunstein, 2007).
       </p>

       Why is this "limited hangout" idea being pushed so much?  One problem is that our government keeps covering up its criminal secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the much bigger problem is that we know these problems exist and do not act on them.  We already know enough that several government officials (and corporate stooges that cooperated in the spying) should spend the rest of their lives in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never downplay the significance of this information about criminals who should be jailed.

       While I do have some sympathy for the limited hangout theory; it also seems just as plausible that Snowden was a lower level employee than Tice and leaked the best of what he found. Tice seems to indicate this when he talks about compartmentalization of clearances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about your average company; yes the IT admins are going to have access to pretty much everything; but the really important stuff you keep within the board of trustees/directors meetings. This logic is clearly taken to the extreme in the intelligence community, as Tice indicates.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, yes your four points at the end make sense if the governmental apparatus is invoking some type of perverted "preemptive Hegelian dialectic" (trying to define the antithesis with aim towards crafting an inorganic synthesis), but it is also just a plausible that they could have accomplished that goals without the PR disatser that was the 12 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all the Snowden leaks brought the section 702 and section 215 stuff to the forefront of the American Consciousness; and I just don't see how the NSA would see a net benefit (even with the preemptive dialectic stuff) by putting such information out there.

       sure, but, we wont get 100% of what snowden released. So, we will (never?) know everything he knew and had.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, for awhile we thought Snowden was just a 'low level tech' or what have you, and then we learned in his nbc interview that he was in fact trained as a spy in the traditional sense

       William Binney, Thomas Drake and Russ Tice have all been interviewed on 60 minutes. So was John Kiriakou who is in jail for exposing CIA torture.

       William Binney was even interviewed by Glenn Beck. If you have something important to say you should try to reach as many people as possible

       Probably there's a power struggle against the COO apparatus.  Maybe some people have finally had enough, hopefully it's Special Services.  We heard Snowden enlisted as one.

       I think it's more complicated than presented.  There are certainly people interested in keeping the rivalry going - that's evident in the propaganda push to go back to cold-war, arms race times.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time I think there's a bigger control (that's linked to the entire connections of the whole planet) that will counteract, or use that - even if unwittingly.   This is a closed system, there are physical laws of social dynamics, that I think the more you try to control, the less control you'll end up having, even if it produces chaos for a while.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "In the end, the political and economic systems can be harmonized in only one of two ways: by
        <strong>
         creating an international political regulatory system
        </strong>
        with the same reach as that of the economic world; or by shrinking the economic units to a size manageable by existing political structures, which is likely to lead to a new mercantilism, perhaps of regional units. A new Bretton Woods kind of global agreement is by far the preferable outcome…"

       Another wall 'o text and buttloads of links..I'll hand it to you guys, you are dedicated. I agree with something someone else mentioned: It makes no sense to want the public to know this. Things were fine when average never entertained these ideas. They would call those who did, conspiracy kooks. But they can't anymore with the Snowden revelations. Like, I don't see the valuable thing the NSA has gain, if this were L.H. They wanted to cause US tech businesses to suffer? They want to cause diplomatic rows with are true allies? Pardon my french, bit would be a stupid fucking idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what? What is this great outcome they've engineered? I'm not sure this L.H. theory takes into account the worry about waking sleeping giants, which has the potential to do. NSA does not want spend all this time and energy fighting accusations of law-breaking, killing the US tech sector, having to lie in front of congress pissing everyone off more. God, the more I contemplate this, the stupider it all sounds!   (sorry, phone typing over here!)

       I would say you are wrong. Think deeper, what good is a police state if the people don't know they live in one.

       has to gain*. Another thing is, all the attention is on the NSA and not the FBI or CIA.

       That doesn't make any sense. The American police state is effective precisely because most Americans don't think they live in one. 5% of the world's population, 25% of the world's prisoners, yet they consider themselves the "Land of the free".

       Sorry for not seeing in line with you on every thought. If you think I'm an alt that's your problem, not mine. I think I've been as consistent as someone can be expected to be, if you want to point out where I wasn't I'd be willing to look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, can you explain what it means that a police state is stronger if people don't think they're in a police state? I can sort of see what he might be getting at but I've never heard anyone expand on the thought.
      </p>

       I hope this was satisfactory. I'm really scared of getting a clueless tag from you, please stop threatening I can't take it anymore.

       Lots of possibilities on the Snowden information, one surprise for the ones making the release, a ?  on all the noise from any who had read the earlier reports of these programs, here is one, there were others.

       In unveiling new Edward Snowden revelations about NSA spying, the Washington Post has once again whitewashed the fact that the content of all our communications have been stored and analyzed under the Echelon program since the 1990′s.
This notion that the NSA just accidentally happens to record the locations of Americans using data from their cellphones, and is not deliberately engaging in domestic surveillance, is yet another example of damage control by the establishment.
In 1999, the Australian government admitted that they were part of an NSA-led global intercept and surveillance program called Echelon in alliance with the US and Britain that could listen to “every international telephone call, fax, e-mail, or radio transmission,” on the planet.[9]
In addition, a 2001 European Parliament report stated that “within Europe all e-mail, telephone and fax communications are routinely intercepted” by the NSA.

       A book I have just published "Play the game, Son" - Michael Swan  (it's on all e-book sites) details trading of encryption codes in Hong Kong. Snowden was a nobody... It's "a true story, made up" all names are changed to protect the innocent and the companies. Worth a quick skim. The second half details the trading of codes, the first describes one of the main characters involved. Enjoy. MSWAN
