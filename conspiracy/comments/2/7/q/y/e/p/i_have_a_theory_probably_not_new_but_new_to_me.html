       I have no proof or facts other than reddit posts that seem to surface every other day about a sheriffs department getting a new tank or something ridiculous. On the top page right now is a NY Times article about police receiving war gear from the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       so I don't need to tell you about martial law,  FEMA and local police turned into military by executive order. However, it's right in all of our faces. At this point they're not even trying to hide it and most people don't care. Slap a DARE sticker on the side of an M1A1 tank and it's a tool for a sheriff to fight drugs... But at the end of the day it's a war machine with a sticker on it rolling down our American streets.

       In this subreddit, this is more of a rant than providing anything of substance but I'd love to hear you guys pitch in and tell me your opinions or hear your rants.

       If not a coming natural catastrophe or instigated social unrest event, guess the easiest explanation is the
       <em>
        'trickle-down'
       </em>
       of equipment that someone made quite some profit off and now is taking space in the warehouses, space needed for newer, more expensive toys that someone is going to make another big profit off and that us chumps will pay for, again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, the cementing of the Us-Vs-Them, the continuing widening of the separation between law officers and general population. Granted, they have a thankless, difficult job, so privileges, turning a blind eye when they
       <em>
        goof up
       </em>
       or commit a crime or two and letting them play with shiny macho toys helps them from ever siding with the population against their masters.

       Just to play devils advocate, a lot of these heavy machines that were used in the wars are being repurposed legitimately. A friend if mine was telling me they are gonna  scrap and disassemble a lot of MRAP'S instead of shipping them back, which as a taxpayer would also piss me off.

       It's not really free though. You need special equipment, training, and people to maintain and supply these machines. So, there is a long term cash drag associated with these. It is not free beer exactly.

       They are militarizing the police for when the commanding military officer takes over he will have a fully equipped crew.  They already have all the military gear to wear and now all the gear for driving.  The police officers who don't go under military command will be turned into civilians instantly or court martialed.
They are totally gearing up for martial law only they won't call it that....EVER!  They will never tell the public they are under martial law.  It'll just happen one day like at Boston bombing.
They will probably first start off with taking away all guns one house at a time on one block.....then move over a few blocks and do it again.  Eventually they will end up back at the first block and do it to someone else.  (it's like the old saying...They came for my neighbor but I did nothing because it wasn't me.  Then it was you!)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't think they have a list...then your sadly mistaken and naive!  They have been raiding gun stores already and taking their lists of people from them.....no other reason!  SO if you have bought a gun or ammo or belong to a magazine subscription to guns and ammo or a mailing list for sales for weapons.  Or even if you have said online that you own guns then your on that list.  Even if you are a collector; they have come for them already, you will be next!
One at a time until there is no more threat....then BAM...they are going to do whatever they want!
      </p>
      <p>
       What they really want is no more physical currency/no more guns/no more internet privacy!  They want complete control of all money and they want to know if your a sheep.  If your a sheep you'll be safe for a while.  If your a truther your a target!  If your a prepper then your a target.  If you don't agree with the MSM or government then your a target!  And the big one.....IF YOU BELIEVE IN RELIGION then you are a HUGE target!  Why?  Because people who belong to religions have support and a group.  They don't like people who have others to help and rely on.  A religious group can shelter and help members.  There ultimate goal is complete control of your life and money.  Once there is no physical money then they control the ones and zeros in your account.  If you don't follow along they simply turn off your money.  Which takes away your house, which causes strife in families which takes away your family.  MONEY is control, and those who control the money, control YOU!  Think about it.  Arron Russo warned the world many years ago and you can watch it happen.  Hell it's been happening!
Once they have complete control of all money then they could easily kill millions if they want.   Rolling chip turn offs.  Once your chip is off, you would probably wish you where dead.  Many will say, "well I'll just go camping and live in the forest.  To bad they own those and can shut them down to the public.  They have already done it as a test run last year.  There will be no where to run and hide.  They will probably also make it illegal to help out people who have had the chip turned off.  Help out a turned off chip and you risk having your own turned off sort of thing.
Then they may say we all need to go to war.  That would probably kill millions to billions.
       <br/>
       There ultimate goal is to be the elite who are the only ones left.  Only those in on the genocide or who support it will be left.  They want to have only their families bloodlines carry on.
       <br/>
       That's what happens when the rich get to rich.  They start thinking and scheming about ways to benefit only them in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever really listen to the elite you will start to notice a few things.   One major thing is that they are extremely racist and bigoted.  They Fear and hate the muslims because they are breeding to fast and taking over countries through bloodlines.  Same goes with every other race out there.  They fear the muslims the most though, because of their religion.  They also fear anyone who is not in their club.  They view almost everyone as a threat.

      <p>
       <em>
        Ordo ab Chao
       </em>
       : A second American civil war, orchestrated by TPBP via the imposition of an increasingly totalitarian government and tactfully controlled opposition, ignited via the execution of a typical Hegelian false-flag event (or events, culminating in one key event over time) at which point C.O.G. will be fully implemented, to suspend the Constitution indefinitely, a convenient way to continue the process of de-population or to 'cull' the masses, targeting certain religious groups and those living in rural communities for relocation or elimination, to create a new Constitution sans a 2nd and 4th Amendment (among others), and to establish a "New America" controlled by the ruling elite on the backs of the remaining North Americans left alive to see it, in a neo-feudalist utopia for the wealthy and hell for the only other remaining class: the poor / the cattle / the debt slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say, none of this would happen overnight. It may not be today, tomorrow, a week, month, or year from now, but would remain no less an inevitability.

       I agree with you on the control part and most of what you are saying. But, if you think for one minute that the armed citizens of this constitutionally backed country are going to willingly give up their weapons, even as much as a fucking sling shot, then you need to spark another bowl. Hell, most of the law enforcement population supports gun ownership. It's the weird mother fuckers who are raising more weird mother fuckers you have to watch out for. My best guess is; that the citizens of this great country are going to get fed up with the same old bull shit, and in some form or another send a message, that they want things changed. Lets face it, Mother Nature is fed up with us anyway, she is going wipe us all out and start over. Hows that for a conspiracy theory?

       This likely won't be popular as martial law is a pretty common fear / fantasy of many here, but IMHO this represents a different kind of conspiracy...  The wars are drawing down, the military bought a ton of theater specific gear (ie MRAPS) it has no interest in keeping, maintaining etc. Given the rapid acquisition, this means it would end up being a net loss for the defense contractors. Solution? Create/expand new markets. MIC companies make their money not on the equipment, but training and sustaining it. This takes a ton of equipment that otherwise would have been destroyed with the investments in training maintainers/trainers lost and lets the companies continue to profit. Where you see martial law/FEMA I see a corrupt process driven by the bottom line and enabled by DoD/Congress etc. While this could embolden some future group to seek to use the capabilities for suppressing some insurrection or psychological conditioning, I think this trend is simply profit driven with little actual thought given to long term consequences. As is often the case, Hanlon's razor works pretty damn well, especially if you add
       <strong>
        greed
       </strong>
       next to

The tool are there, I just waiting for a President to act on them when the time either comes or is generated.

       All the military equipment ends up being spread out, making a martial law easier for states to enact. On the flip side if a world war were to break out and military bases were to get hit there ends up being equipment spread out everywhere so not everything gets destroyed making mobility easier.

       They claim that they are worried that the many, well trained veterans will become terrorists. Probably because they are planning on pissing off all the veterans.

       What? Governments view the people as their enemy? /s

      <p>
       National Security is the justification, fighting terrorism is the justification for eroding civil liberties. National security does not mean keeping the people safe, it means keeping the government (those who control it) in power.

       To enter the world of basic logic you have to have the knowledge for a foundation. Up until a few weeks ago I was like the majority of Americans and didn't know the power FEMA had. I just thought it was a natural disaster relief group like American Red Cross or something like that. I'd never even heard of it until Katrina. Also I didn't know Obama enacted martial law amendments that gave executive freedom to wipe the laws of the constitution and Bill of Rights on a whim. I have the basic knowledge now and I'm starting to put it all together. It may be common sense to people like you and others who are active in this sub but for the vast majority of people this is a terrifying revelation.

       I'm glad you've joined the enlightened.  The truth has always been here, and once you decided to seek it, it was readily exposed.  What do you believe of the recent spat of staged mass shootings and their Zionist control?  What about this criminal group that has taken over the House, Senate, and Executive offices?

       Several issues with the theories I am seeing here. 1 The lower enlisted are on America's side not the politicians. 2 We(vets) used these in combat and know how to eliminate them. 3 While they are big and scary they aren't going to be good against suburban areas, to big, slow, cumbersome, and in efficient. These will just be giant targets for people.

       Assuming you're completely correct, they're still being used as a terror tactic against civilians. They parade these things and post them in local news papers for all to see... To be used as fear propaganda. And it's working, on me at least.

       Just giving my opinion as a long time resident of Hawaii. We recently saw a huge armored truck on our island and it was alarming. Just cruising through town like nothing. Perhaps to get the people used to it? Now don't get me wrong. We are sadly used to military convoys traveling, huge aerial displays of epic proportions like the Century Aloha exercises, military bombing at Pohakuloa  and many sea focused training exercises literally coming up on shore; but an armored vehicle for the local police department? Why? We are on a large island but with little population and much less crime than Oahu. Not that it even justifies these vehicles being acquired by law enforcement. We don't even have swat here. I spent hours online trying to track this down as definite proof. Nothing anywhere online. Friends in swat told us we were correct. There is an armored vehicle now owned by local police. We had heard Maui county had one, but us too? WTF? Now according to this article which shows every state as an info graphic; there are three in Hawaii!?  And many many more across the mainland. This is an Xpost from

       Well, there is this thing called the posse comitatus act. It restricts the federal givernment from using the federal military to enforce laws at the state level.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, mr. Obama doesnt seem to like the fact that is boys cant do his bidding on the state level. So, what does a previous constitutional lawyer turned potus do? He creates a monster out of the DHS, armed to the teeth that rivals our military. Thats not enough? So then might as well arm local law enforcement and the post office while your at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sum of all the armed departments of the federal government, as obama had promised, is approaching the size and capability of our military.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why on earth would he want so much firepower WITHIN our borders? Its not to protect us from outside threats, as that the job for our military. So, the only other logical reason is it is to protect from domestic threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which, thanks to the second amendment, we can protect ourselves with our own firearms. Yet, wait. Obamas administration andbjustice dept. Are trying to get rid of all the peoples guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the only logical explanation now is that the militarized depts. Of the federal government are not here to protect us, the citizenry, but to protect the government and its cronies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know that if they continue on with their agenda, it will provoke the american people to rise up, eventually. Cant say when, but it will, eventually. So, better to be prepared by arming your guys up ahead of time by finding a loophole to the posse comitatus act by first creating the dhs and then arming them and other depts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, i dont buy their explanation that its for fraud protection, or to protect the citizens. If they were worried about our safety they would be for letting us protect ourselves. No, this militarization is to protect their assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hardly honorable motives.

       I think according to article 215 of the patriot act, martial law is technically already here.  It doesn't have the same look as in a banana republic, but if you break down the country is run by the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US economy is based on war, energy, and technology services.  The close connection those sectors have with the military and intelligence apparatus isn't something we generally acknowledge.  Even more hush hush is the relationship with healthcare, education and professional athletics.
      </p>
      <p>
       War and technology products have been consistently used against the poor throughout the world.  When there are no more wars to be fought, these industries are going to turn their sights on the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       As domestic workers on the lower end of the economic totem pole are being asked to compete more with the unskilled workers in emerging markets, their standard of living drops.  If there ever comes a time when austerity is "necessary" to precipitate some sort of shift, the poor are going to be the ones to react (though technically the middle class might be the hardest hit in relative terms).
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, tptb are afraid of rioting black people in the inner cities.  Hopefully we'll never get to the type of austerity where the poor are being asked to skip more meals, but if we do, you can guarantee that the media will be working to divide people on racial lines and that white middle class people will be cheering as war machines roll down their block, "keeping them sage from the unruly masses".

       It's actually been referred to in history as the apocalypse, aka judgement day, aka the rapture, and pick your fucking religious term for whatever it is. The obvious point is those in power are scared of something going down between them and us, and they aren't letting us know what the cause will be. When it does happen I doubt they will even have enough gas to run those giant pieces of shit.

       Yeah I don't really know about that. I know that droughts and erratic weather are causing crops to fail which drives up inflation, I know that the economies world wide are failing due to this. I know that earthquakes and tsunamis and tornados and hurricanes are increasing which in turn drives up the cost of everything which in turn makes everything unstable. The earth is a fickle bitch and it wouldn't take much more other then natural circumstances to turn the peoples smolder into a raging inferno dude. Where do you live?

       Like peak oil was here in the 70's? Or maybe like it was here in the early 2000's? There are still lots of untapped oil wells, probably undiscovered wells also.

       Conventional oil production peaked around 2006. The only countries that haven't peaked yet are Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, and Iran. Fracking and tight oil disguised this but, now, the the tight oil plays are starting to peak. This data is published monthly by the EIA, so you can see for yourself.

       Also, lots of over reporting to keep company books up and shareholders happy. The reality is that only a fraction exists. Everybody knows it. Because of this, we seek reserves elsewhere. Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Ukraine and such.

       Why would law enforcement need military vehicles to implement martial law? You do realize we have a huge military to do things like this right?

       Big city cop here... can verify they are not training us for this martial law, or civil unrest. We don't even have enough cruisers for a shift. We do have bob cats and an "mrap" for SWAT. For anybody who thinks that's overkill, I'd like to see you go to a barricaded person with a gun, holding someone hostage. Just go run up to the door and clear it like call of duty , right?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, we're all going home at the end of shift. Because we utilize these vehicles, we can usually talk people out of the situations, instead of going in and risking getting shot when we don't have to.

       Nope, the negotiations officers are able to pull up close to the building and talk over the PA system. Sure beats telling from 3 blocks away when the bad guy doesn't answer his phone.

       I guarantee our guys aren't going to go house to house rounding up weapons and people to put in FEMA camps. We're not the national guard.

       I mean why not just get loudspeakers then? I still don't see the need for armored military vehicles though.

       You don't understand, we use the armored vehicles because the people we deal with hate us, and don't care if they kill us or others. We do care. And we're not going to give them a free chance. I'd recommend contacting tour local swat unit and ask if they can give you examples of when they typically use the vehicles.
