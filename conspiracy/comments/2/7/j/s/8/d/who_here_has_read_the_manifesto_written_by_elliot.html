        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have seen that a lot of people seem to think that this shooting was a hoax.  I just read his manifesto (over 100k words) and it occurred to me that if this was all a hoax to help bring about gun control, why wouldn&#39;t he have made some sort of declaration during his 100k words about how it was so thoughtless and easy for him to obtain guns.  He spends most of his time talking about how he can&#39;t get laid and hates women for not liking him.  Was this a conspiracy put forth by the feminist movement?!  OOORRRRR is it more likely that this was a mentally ill person who was not brought up correctly and finally enough straws were placed on the camel&#39;s back that it broke, and now the shooting is being used to make political statements?  I know this post seems condescending but if you are someone who truly believes this is a hoax, try to ask yourself that question and answer honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just casually reading about this and stumbled onto a hoax video on youtube after seeing the killers own video. </p>

<p>I think the hoax makes some good points, like why the owner of the deli store was allowed to hold onto the bullets, there was a bullet case on the floor, and why the workers were cleaning up the blood and not some government official who properly cleaned up the crime site and put the bullet casings in evidence. </p>

<p>We have to remember that the 3 deaths in the room were all stabbings, only the outside killings were with a gun. I am sure that whether this is real or not, the media is def trying to spin this into gun control (which I think is ridiculous, we should all be able to protect ourselves, its just a fact that some people are batshit crazy and you can&#39;t always tell my talking to them..... expect the best, prepare for the worst). </p>

<p>I think its kinda shady the father who&#39;s son just died a day ago was making speeches and stuff and not grieving. Atleast take a week or so to grieve and bury your son before going on the offensive. I know blaming others is part of the grief process, but it seems too soon. </p>

<p>I am also sure that feminists/misogynists are def taking advantage of the situation, regardless of whether it is real or not. Thats obvious by what you see and read in various places. </p>

<p>It seems believable, and the killer was most certainly not right in the head and had some serious issues.... but there is also some questionable stuff I have seen like with the deli store, people also say more blood should have been in the car... alot of people interviewed seem to say he was nice but then reword themselves. Its just weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Murders (especially mass shootings) do tend to be weird because normal people can&#39;t wrap their mind around why/how somebody could randomly murder people.  As far as the deli thing goes, there is no government agency that comes in and cleans up the blood.  My buddy works for a company that does that.  They are not government affiliated.  It is a private company and after the cops leave they get a call to go in and clean the place up (at the expense of the store owner or home owner or whatever the case may be).  They just need to be certified and registered and they can do the job.  The store owner probably didn&#39;t want to pay for the service and didn&#39;t realize you have to get rid of haz-mat like blood in a particular way.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they write a fiction that is completely the opposite of what they are trying to achieve?  If you would actually look at shit using facts rather than having a preconceived conclusion and working backwards from that and trying to make the &quot;evidence&quot; fit your idea by excluding everything they doesn&#39;t work as &quot;fiction&quot; you&#39;d see that you have no idea what you are talking about.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe this guy was just insane. People, including his own family, tried to help him and the system failed.<br/>
  The conspiracy theory  is this: this guy was crazy and determined to hurt people and no one could stop him in spite of massive evidence right out there in the open that something really ugly was going to happen. Hell, one of his YouTube videos was posted to reddit before it happened.  These recent shootings, the common thread has been they were all crazy. They were known to have mental issues and we still couldn&#39;t stop them. (The one in Ga and this guy are the ones I&#39;m talking about) Think of it like the Overton window. If the big bad government jumps in to take our guns they will have a bloody civil war on their hands. So how do they achieve taking guns and limiting more and more rights? Through fear and dissent, changing the opinion of the populace gradually until the people believe it was their idea in the first place.  &quot;There is no possible way we can stop the crazy people 100% of the time, so we have to take the weapons away from them and impose stricter monitoring of the public to catch this before it happens again&quot;  his manifesto didn&#39;t need to rant about how easy it was for him to get guns; that&#39;s obvious.  It needed to prove he was batshit crazy, everyone knew it, and we still couldn&#39;t stop him.  After several of these mass murders by mentally ill people, people start to shift their view. They&#39;re out in the mall and looking around at the crowd wondering how many crazy people with guns are walking around them right now.  Wouldn&#39;t we all be safer if there were no guns, or people were monitored more closely for mental illness? We could intervene and help these people if we only had a way to predict whose going to go on a shooting rampage...right? Like strict behavior pattern monitoring and profiling? 
  The message isn&#39;t &quot;we need to get rid of the guns and start monitoring and profiling&quot;  it&#39;s &quot;you&#39;re never going to feel safe until we do.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.. and if this wasn&#39;t a conspiracy planned out by the government isn&#39;t this exactly what it would look like anyways?  There <em>are</em> crazy people with guns who will shoot people.  That is the world we live in.  People genuinely don&#39;t know what to do to stop it from happening and they are searching for an answer.  This isn&#39;t a conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why my first statement was that I believe the guy was just crazy.      I don&#39;t believe it was anything more than that. You asked for an explanation of how this could be a conspiracy and I gave you one theory I&#39;ve heard thrown about.  Just about anything that happens anywhere at anytime can be a conspiracy theory if you believe that everyone has an agenda. I believe sometimes bad things happen for no reason at all, and sometimes they are orchestrated. Someone with an agenda will find a way to use it either way. The only foolish way to think is that there is no agenda.  The government and some of the people want more restrictions and fewer guns in the name of personal safety. The other side wants less gun restriction &amp; less monitoring/privacy invasion. Most people just want to feel safe.  This was a tragic event, but it will be used to promote someones agenda.  Do I personally believe the government orchestrated this? No. Will it be used as a means to an end? Yes. They definitely want the ability to collect more data, they&#39;d be foolish not to use this. Does that mean they planned it? No. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, then we basically agree.  I don&#39;t think that this was hoaxed or planned.  But, like after any event of this nature, it will be used as a political football.  To me the conspiracies tend to occur after the event happens.  That&#39;s when the special interest groups and politicians get together and decide how to best use the situation to their gain.  The NRA will ask for more donations from their members because &quot;Obama is coming for your guns&quot; and they&#39;ll make billions like they did after Sandy Hook and Aurora and the left-wingers will spout their call for gun control, or mental health awareness and how we can use government to prevent this from happening again (which is impossible).  I am just stunned by the amount of people who believe this whole situation didn&#39;t even happen.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well why, if this was a hoax, wouldn&#39;t the manifesto read like a &quot;guns are why this was so easy to happen&quot; playbook?  When you read the manifesto, everything this kid was into was completely leftwing.  He even makes mention of his intent to use knives.  Why would whoever hoaxed this (if the purpose was to garner support for gun control) have the killer talking about how he can&#39;t wait to stab his stepmother in the throat instead of talking about shooting her?  Why would the first killings (his house mates) have been done by way of knife?  How does any of this add up to &quot;a hoax so they can come take our guns!!&quot;?

<p>No. There is a consensus among educated people. I&#39;m not citing one man, though I do direct you heavily to the Cambridge Prof I quoted, but stating what society has broadly agreed upon. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Some far-right movements, such as the Nazis,</strong> have pursued oppression and genocide against groups of people on the basis of their alleged inferiority.[2]</p>

<p>Far-right politics commonly includes authoritarianism, anti-communism, and nativism.[3] Often, the term &quot;far right&quot; is applied to fascists and neo-Nazis,[4][5][6][7][8] and major elements of fascism have been deemed clearly far-right, such as its belief that supposedly superior people have the right to dominate society while purging allegedly inferior elements, and — <strong>in the case of Nazism</strong> — genocide of people deemed to be inferior.[9]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics</a></p>

<p>Nazism is <em>the</em> text-book far-right ideology. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The far left seeks a society in which</strong> everyone is provided equal economic and social opportunities, and <strong>no one has excessive</strong> wealth or <strong>power over others</strong>.[1]</p>
