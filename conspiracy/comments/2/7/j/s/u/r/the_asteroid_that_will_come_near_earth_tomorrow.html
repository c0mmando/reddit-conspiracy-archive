       I just wanted to see what you guys think about this. Here is something on the asteroid. The Beast

       There are some historic events taking place at the same time and some significant religious stuff falling on the same day. The Pope has invited the president of Israel and the president of Palestine for a peace prayer. Both agreed. It will be the first time in history that a Islamic prayer will be held within the walls of the Vatican. Daboo7 explains all this better than any single article.

       What exactly did he state he feared? To me it seams he just pointed out some strange coincidences. There sure has been a lot of unfounded attempts to paint Daboo7 as a fear monger and compare him to Alex Jones lately. What is up with that?

       Its pretty funny because he vehemently detests AJ for all his bullshit. I like Dahboo lol, his hearts in the right place IMO and even when he's wrong he's at least interesting to listen to for a few minutes. I'll take a 3 minute vid of his over 50 minutes of AJ shaking his jowls in a panic trying to sell me cock pills so I'm strong enough to fight the nwo.

       These seem like two things that are completely unrelated, not to mention how not dangerous that asteroid is due to it still being pretty far away.

       Here's a little thing I liked to tell my grandma:
      </p>
      <p>
       Get yourself a whole bunch of basketballs and line 30 of them in a row - That long line of basketballs is the Earth/Moon relationship relative to the size of the Earth.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       This asteroid will come within range of about 90 basketballs.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a damn big amount of space. So what's the concern?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm shocked by the amount of scientific illiteracy in this thread.

       Oh I understood that, if there was a relatively large object thought to hit Earth people would be paying a lot of attention or freaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just that you seem to be thinking that an object far smaller than the moon and far further from Earth than the moon would have any impact on life on Earth, is a wee bit silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       An object that far away and that small isn't of any concern to life on Earth.

       Simple physics shows that our solar system is a tightly knit balance of energies (gravitational and otherwise). Therefore a foreign body entering it will at least have a subtle effect, according to known physics. What that effect will be? Earth quakes? volcano eruptions? World wide diarrhea? Who knows. But there are many beliefs in astrological religious connects that are interesting....I know I will be staying close to a toilet tomorrow :)

       While it will have an effect, it's likely small. The real concern is more along the lines of "signs" many religions believe that we should look to the heavens for signs. (Note, some religions believe that there are signs in the stars/heavens, others that the stars themselves somehow dictate what's going to happen.)

       The theological interest of this is that in Revelations it says "The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water— the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter." (Rev 8:10–11) Now my personal thoughts are that the bible is used to control people like much of religion. But the first link that shows multiple angles; looks as if we will cross right through the asteroids path. Could a similar event have happened and the ancients misinterpreted it has something else? Will we experience a similar event tomorrow? Probably not but none the less I see where yellowsnow2 is coming from. Upvote for mild interest.

       is also the name of a plant with hallucinogenic properties, aka absinthe.  Maybe people back in the day were partying really hard and that's where that star moving across the sky came from.

       Over a million km's away. Not close at all. Not worth breaking a sweat over.

       Did you know that '99942 Apophis' will fly by the Earth WITHIN the distance of the moon in 2029? - In fact it will fly by within the equivalent of 3 basketballs?
      </p>
      <p>
       So OP's asteroid is 90 basketballs, the Moon is 30, Apophis is 3! But we're not concerned about that either.

      <p>

       Potentially hazardous... Yet over a million kilometres away?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to talk about potentially hazardous, refer to 99942 Apophis which will come to approximately 38,000km's away in 2029.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Beast poses no threat whatsoever to Earth life.

      <p>
       &gt;1,000,000km vs 38,000km - You decide which is a greater threat.

       Oh I understood that, if there was a relatively large object thought to hit Earth people would be paying a lot of attention or freaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just that you seem to be thinking that an object far smaller than the moon and far further from Earth than the moon would have any impact on life on Earth, is a wee bit silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       An object that far away and that small isn't of any concern to life on Earth.
