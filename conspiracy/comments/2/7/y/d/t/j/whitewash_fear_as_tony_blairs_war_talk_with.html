        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>‘Whitewash’ fear as Tony Blair’s war talk with George Bush is to stay secret</p>

<p>ANGER was sparked after an “unsatisfactory” deal was struck yesterday which will keep secret the full extent of the British Government’s role in the build-up to the Iraq war.</p>

<p>A long-awaited report into the 2003 conflict could be published before next year’s election after it was agreed that exchanges between George Bush and Tony Blair may be revealed.</p>

<p>But only the “gist” of conversations between the former US President and prime minister are being released and full details will remain secret.</p>

<p>With potentially damaging ­material withheld from the public, the decision sparked fears of a whitewash.</p>

<p>Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell warned: “The word ‘gist’ can be subject to a whole variety of interpretations and is an unsatisfactory compromise.”</p>

<p>Rose Gentle, whose son Gordon died in Iraq in 2004, said the move was “a disappointment” – and that families of soldiers who died in the conflict had “a right” to see the correspondence.</p>

<p>Years of negotiations over the release of the material – which includes 25 notes from Mr Blair to Mr Bush and more than 130 records of conversations between them – is understood to have been behind the delay in publication of the Chilcot report into the conflict.</p>

<p>Under the deal, the details disclosed will be limited to “quotes or gists” and the report’s use of the material “should not reflect President Bush’s views”.</p>

<p>The deal was struck by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, Mr Blair’s principal private secretary in the run-up to the war, and inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot.</p>
