<p>middle aged male and a 20 year old female thrusts herself at him.</p>

<p>thats a very tricky situation for the average older male, some will have the willpower or intelligence to resist, many wont.</p>

<p>this entrapment technique would prob work on a lot of older women too, people are vain and looking for love.</p>

<p>add to the mix miserable marriages and spouses that are too busy with their separate careers.</p>

<p>it the oldest trick in the espionage world&#39;s book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are credible sources out there on UFOs, but Hellyer is not one of them. Yes, he was Defense Minister of Canada, but his interest in UFOs did not arise until long after he was out of office. He doesn&#39;t have any insider information. If you want some tantalizing official statements on UFOs, you need look no further than some of the documents from the U.S. that have been released under FOIA. For example:  </p>

<p>1947 - General George Schulgen sends a memo to General Nathan Twining inquiring about the UFO situation. Twining, then-head of Air Material Command&#39;s intelligence and engineering divisions at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, sends a reply now known as the Twining Memo. It states, in part, that &quot;The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious. [...] There are objects probably approximately the shape of a disc, of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as a man-made aircraft. [...] The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely.&quot;  </p>

<p>1948 - The Air Force undertakes Project Sign to study UFOs.  The report concludes that while many UFO sightings have mundane explanations, some are likely of extraterrestrial origin. When the study reaches the desk of General Hoyt Vandenberg, he orders all copies of it destroyed and disbands the project.  </p>

<p>1949 - The FBI issues a classified memo entitled &quot;Protection of Vital Installations&quot;. The document notes that “Army intelligence has recently said that the matter of ‘Unidentified Aircraft’ or ‘Unidentified Aerial Phenomena,’ otherwise known as ‘Flying Discs,’ ‘Flying Saucers,’ and ‘Balls of Fire,’ is considered top secret by intelligence officers of both the Army and the Air Forces&quot;. The memo expresses concern over the violation of airspace over Los Alamos and other sensitive facilities by unknown craft displaying exceptional maneuverability and travelling at up to 27,000 mph.  </p>

<p>1952 - H. Marshall Chadwell, the CIA&#39;s director of scientific intelligence, sends a memo to CIA Director Walter Smith stating, &quot;At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention.... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and travelling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.”  </p>

<p>1954 - Maxwell Air Force Base sends an emergency memo to the CIA, NSA, and Joint Chiefs of Staff stating that a saucer-like flying object rapidly entered their airspace, hovered for some time, and then just as rapidly vanished.  </p>
