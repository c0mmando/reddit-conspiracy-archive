The practice of solitary confinement should be outlawed.  It does nothing but make the person experiencing it insane.  It has no rehabilitating value at all.  I feel sorry for this person no matter what he did to get himself in there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I know. That Norway prison is amazing. I&#39;d commit a crime just to get in there. There&#39;s also those prisons in one of the nordic countries that basically has dorm rooms (with internet) and kitchens for inmates to use.

<p>rehabilitation </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m confused by your use of rehabilitation.  The given definition is: to restore to a former capacity;  to restore to a former state. I feel as if you are using(intentionally or not) it in a manner similar to doublespeak.</p>

<p>I feel like your argument would make more sense if you used the word submission or maybe conformation. Unless you are trying to subtlety influence - in which case, carry on.</p>

<p>What does that matter whatsoever? Humans aren&#39;t animals.</p>

<p>We do not base our actions on that of animals, are you nuts?</p>

<p>This is why we DO cage other humans, because we&#39;re not animals and our first and primary solution to a person doing something wrong is not &quot;kill them&quot; because we are far more intelligent than that and can use our intelligence to solve the problem of that person and their bad behaviors.</p>

<p>Hammurabi and his stupid ass code is an eye for an eye, murder the murderers.</p>

<p>SO, why are there still murderers and thieves?</p>

<p>All those pirates were hung and executed for what they did, did that end any and all piracy for all time on planet Earth?</p>

<p>NO, it didn&#39;t, WOW, who would have guessed.</p>

<p>Your comment is insanely stupid, my word I can&#39;t even express the level of ignorance displayed within it it&#39;s so absurd.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like we have this immense wealth of knowledge to completely disprove every single opinion you&#39;re expressing as being any form of an acceptable solution to our human problems, and you choose to just straight up ignore all that shit.</p>

<p>In favor of a bullshit eye for an eye system that some old asshole Hammurabi made up which provably doesn&#39;t work?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand how &#39;eye for an eye&#39; works, do you? It&#39;s about risk assessment. If someone thinks they can get away with something, they will do it. They will weigh the risks vs the reward. If they come up with &quot;reward is worth it&quot;, they will commit the crime. It sounds like you&#39;re defensive because you have been convicted of something and you don&#39;t want to be killed or maimed in the future for a crime you will commit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why buy poetry when you can make better poetry yourself?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even joking, poetry is so subjective it&#39;s not even worth money, because literally everybody can do it.</p>

<p>Have you ever read modern poetry? A lot of it isn&#39;t worth paying for at all because it&#39;s so bad, it&#39;s hardly even poetry it&#39;s just odd hipster writings.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more of a traditionalist when it comes to poetry because that stuff is actually reasonably decipherable unlike most modern poetry which may as well have been written by crazy.</p>

<p>staff are laughing and joking while he dies (they are too busy doing their gossip elsewhere), the supervisor acts all surprised and asks the dead man to open his eyes through the locked and sealed window/door, &#39;he moved hes faking it...&#39; her and one of the staff make jokes about how he likes it on the floor. a coping mechanism for a working situation they know is miserable. </p>

<p>THIS is the cheap &#39;dont give a fuck&#39; societies approach to mental health, ill people are passed over to barely trained, apathetic prison and jail staff, any who cared when they joined are soon reduced down to the apathetic level, they either go along with the norm, or they leave and find a more happy job.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT: <strong>Hyponatremia</strong>, the most commonly encountered electrolyte disorder in clinical practice, is <strong>associated with increased mortality. This harmful medical comorbidity is often overlooked and untreated in psychiatric patients</strong>. In these particular patients, hyponatremia is associated with psychogenic polydipsia. Successful treatment depends upon accurate diagnosis of the severity and underlying etiology along with appropriate tests and monitoring. <strong>Hyponatremia induced by SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion)</strong> and psychogenic polydipsia require significant pharmacist interventions and are frequently seen in psychiatric patients. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epidemiology</p>

<p>... psychotropic drugs may cause the sensation of a dry mouth, which may contribute to increased water intake.8 Thus, causality between psychotropic agents and hyponatremia has been shown more persuasively with antidepressants and mainly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The incidence of hyponatremia caused by SSRIs varies widely, from 0.5% to 32%. </p>

<p>[...] </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hyponatremia caused by SIADH</strong> is due to increased release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). SIADH has been associated with many drugs often used in psychiatric patients, including nicotine, barbiturates, carbamazepine, <strong>antipsychotics</strong>, and antidepressants.</p>
