    <div class="md"><p>NO!!</p>

<p>He&#39;s worth IGNORING with all your being.</p>

<p>Agent Jones is COINTELPRO. He is a Zionist, works with many powerful  Zionists (George Friedman of Stratfor being one), has a flagship station owned by an ARDENT Zionist (Jeffrey R. Smulyan, owner of Emmis &#39;Hebrew for Truth&#39; Communications), and is an Israeli dual-citizen. If someone here is in Federal Law Enforcement feel free to look up Jones (unless his file is sealed) and you&#39;ll see what I mean. In fact, his &quot;infiltration&quot; of the Grove was as fake as HELL...he got in on Smulyan&#39;s invite, then pretended that he was THE MAN!</p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember who it was (some Reagan staffer) but there is a YouTube vid of this guy laying into Jones, saying &quot;you took an oath when we let you in here and now you are breaking it. You, sir, are a dishonorable man.&quot; as Agent J keeps trying to talk over the poor guy. I&#39;m sure that someone can find it.</p>

<p>Any sign of trouble and he is ready to flee to Israel TODAY. Granted, he&#39;ll miss the MANSION outside of Austin that he bought with the paychecks from the suckers that order shit off of his honeypot websites but that&#39;s nothing.</p>

<p>When (not IF, WHEN) the American public figures out what Agent Jones has been doing I can see him swinging from a lamppost if El Al isn&#39;t flying that day. Agent Jones flying &quot;lamppost airways&quot; would be the BEST thing to happen to the &quot;conspiracy movement.&quot; The ONLY reason that he exists (besides the mentioned self-serving ones) is to make people who even <em>mention</em> conspiracies look like utter fucking fools--like the Agent looked when he was on Piers Morgan. That&#39;s it. His only reason for being allowed to live is to spread disinformation and to discredit people that are &quot;onto&quot; something horrible and true. I mean, he is supported by the fucking <strong>ADL.</strong> Now, I have certainly met some shysters in my time...but Abe Foxman, OMFG, this guy is a shyster galore. If he were younger he&#39;d be in the &quot;Kosher Nostra&quot; along with Lansky. <a href="http://www.realzionistnews.com/?p=465">Here, check that out...</a>.</p>

<p>Zionism is NEVER mentioned! I remember this rant in which Jones stated: “Hollywood Is Owned By The Arabs’ - The Arabs Own Everything!” That stunning statement simply shattered the credibility meter. It’s simply a matter of connecting the dots. Even veteran Jerusalem Post reporter, David Shamah, (a vehement Zionist Jew), admits, or to be more accurate, exposed Alex Jones for “being on the Jews’ payroll.” Yes, that is a direct quote from the article. Mr. Shamah states: “Jones believes that the world is run by the Rockefellers, the Trilateral Commission, and the Bilderberg Group. But I never heard him utter the word ‘Jew’ in connection with any of these conspiracies. According to Jones’ Wikipedia biography page: ‘The Alex Jones Show radio program is broadcast live from Emmis Communications KLBJ Radio in Austin, Texas.’</p>

<p>“The CEO of Emmis? Jeff Smulyan, winner of the Jewish National Fund’s Tree of Life Award. Interestingly, I have never seen Smulyan’s name on the lists of Jews who run the media on the Anti-Semitic sites. Could it be they don’t want to make their ‘rebbe,’ Jones, look bad? After all, his salary is being paid by ‘Jew media!’”</p>

<p>Also...Google &quot;David Chase Taylor Alex Jones&quot; and you&#39;ll figure out all you need to know.</p>

<p>For now, he is actually less reliable and MORE fear-mongering than Fox News. Just turn him off. It&#39;s garbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was an Alex Jones fan until he started pushing the &quot;Arabs own Hollywood&quot; propaganda. That particular lie revealed everything I needed to know about this faker. When all real life signs point to Zionism as the source of many major problems and Alex Jones won&#39;t even say the word once during any of his shows, you should be able to connect the dots without much trouble. Thank you for writing this detailed synopsis of the fraud.</p>

<p>Edit: Alex Jones is a master of sociopathic manipulative behaviors. Look up &quot;common tactics of sociopaths&quot; and you&#39;ll get all of Jones&#39; strategies laid out in front of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of legit information that is drowned out by the over-the-top commercialism and pandering to fanaticism.</p>

<p>But if you can cut through the bullshit, it&#39;s tolerable. </p>

<p>My assumption about Alex Jones for a while has been that he&#39;s this commercialized archetype representing the majority of the public awareness of &quot;conspiracy throrists&quot;. </p>

<p>Adds yet another way for people to dismiss others by saying that they are an &quot;Alex Jones&quot; type, by associating the idea of conspiracies with a dude that is never not yelling and angry and over-the-top.</p>

What&#39;s important is that you use your God-given mind to filter the BS to the best of your ability. None of us know the true answers, and Alex Jones is full of fucking shit to be sure, but with that being said it&#39;s better than listening to whatever local radio show you have in your town for getting news about global going ons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to listen to Alex every day. I&#39;ve more or less stopped listening to him. Every now and then I&#39;ll download an hour of his show and try to listen, but I usually end up deleting it halfway through. </p>

<p>Alex just doesn&#39;t have much to say to me anymore. I&#39;m put off by the way he dismisses anyone who disagrees with anything he says, and I don&#39;t like the way he avoids criticizing Jews. It&#39;s weird the way he will talk about everything and everybody associated with the New World Order, but he won&#39;t mention Jews. It&#39;s like some kind of mental defect he suffers from.</p>

<p>That being said, those new to conspiracies can learn a lot by listening to Alex. Just don&#39;t get caught up in his hype. Don&#39;t send him any of your money. Don&#39;t buy his products.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones is a paid govt. shill. He spoons out the few kernels of truth his handlers feed him and makes lots of hay out of it. He has said he has family members who are CIA. His shtick, as others have pointed out, is to act as nutty as possible to make himself and anyone who ascribes to alternative theories seem less than credible. He has been on several mainstream stations and is nominally the media go to conspiracy theorist nut of choice. Those slick movies and web sites aren&#39;t supported by donations or the stuff being hocked on them. All of this being said, even a broken clock is right twice a day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compared to listening to what? I love Alex Jones. I listen to him almost every day. I even paid for his video feed when he released Obama Deception. Loved it. Pure gold. Entertaining and completely satisfying. </p>

<p>I believe his production directly competes with the likes of CNN, FOX, MSNBC, RT.. All of which i would be watching anyway if AJ wasn&#39;t available. </p>

<p>But here on r/conspiracy we are supposed to be cool and pretend we only watch Alex Jones because he is a disinfo agent. He is a big liar who is part of an even BIGGER conspiracy to hurt those in the inner circle of truth. So WATCH OUT! He is DANGEROUS. </p>

<p>Do your own research and you will discover he makes money! And he has connections to people involved with conspiracy theories. He is also a lizard man who secretly defends the elders of Zion who push for mass extermination.. even though he pretends to be against it. He also has an ego! Can you imagine? A man in his position flaunting his ego and pretending to care?</p>

<p>All of the products he sells he doesn&#39;t use. They are all poisonous. He actually thrives on McDonald&#39;s and flu shots behind closed doors with Dick Cheney.</p>

<p>if you are new to conspiracy.. be careful not to become one of Alex Jone&#39;s victims. He will turn you into a lizard loving racist. He also makes money from his business efforts.. what else needs to be said?</p>
