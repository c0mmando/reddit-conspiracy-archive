    <div class="md"><p>We talked about the bailouts. I found it crazy ironic how taxpayers basically funnel money into banks. When the stimulus was pushed, taxpayers dollars were give for free to the bankers. It&#39;s a plain as day cycle how they say we need to bail out the banks and the government just dumps taxpayer dollars into them. Am I understanding this correctly or did it go differently?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great link. Question, when it was said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Author Gabriel Kolko stated, “Morgan’s activities in 1895-1896 in selling US gold bonds in Europe were based on an alliance with the House of Rothschild.” [6]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this specifically mean that the gold backing up the US dollar was being sold by JP Morgan to (possibly) the Rothschild family? I just want to make sure I am not misunderstanding this; it&#39;s crazy overwhelming to think that a COUNTRY could be traded like this.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard stories like this on this subreddit over the course of the last 2 years but reading it for myself is insane.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, it stated how he was a huge backer of western expansion. Did the government become indebted to Morgan so then he owns America?</p>

<p>Edit2: Is it just me or does this guy LOOK evil? <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/JohnPierpontMorgan.png">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/JohnPierpontMorgan.png</a></p>

<p>Specifically, look at the 1895 contract between the Rothschilds, the Morgans and the US Treasury. There are a series of similar contracts from the 1870s to the 1890s, every contract an indicator of how much more the Banking class bought America up in the 19th century.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve was just the endgame of a generations-long push by the Banking powers to own the US. They&#39;ve owned us ever since.</p>

<p>Note that the Rothschilds are still in business. Until just recently, the past couple of months or so, the daily price of gold was fixed and set by the Rothschilds. The Morgan family is no more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>US Federal Reserve Notes are sold to the US government when they buy US treasury bonds. </p>

<p>They lend these notes to the US government at interest.</p>

<p>In any fractional reserve banking setup, there is always more debt than actual money, no matter how much you create (that US Federal Reserve note needs to be paid back to the Fed eventually <em>at interest</em>). As such, there will <strong>never been enough money to pay back the debt, mathematically</strong>.</p>

<p>As an example, say I loan you 100 Jamesmarks than you can distribute to your friends to use as currency in whatever it is you do. I am totally fine with this temporary loss of 100 Jamesmarks, because I&#39;m loaning them to you at a modest interest rate (5%). When it comes time for you to pay me back the 100 Jamesmarks, you will end up owing me 105 Jamesmarks (let&#39;s not get too complicated with compound interest in this example). </p>

<p>How do you plan on paying me back the total sum owed (105 Jamesmarks) when I only lent you 100 previously? You can&#39;t. Which is why it&#39;s a pyramid scheme. Which is why the national debt keeps climbing (because they can never get those extra 5 Jamesmarks, because <strong>I am the only one who makes them</strong> legally thanks to the Federal JamesReserve Act - thanks Congress!). So what do you do? Borrow more Jamesmarks to cover your missing 5 Jamesmarks, and them the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>Now, give it about 200 years.</p>

<p>And then you owe a central bank (and many others, as my example was overly simplistic) a sum climbing towards $18,000,000,000,000. </p>

<p>Does that help?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Goddamn right he did. He actually ran on a ticket to not renew the charter of the Second Bank of the United States.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/21/opinion/21brands.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/21/opinion/21brands.html?_r=0</a></p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s a link to a 2006 NYT op-ed, but the info is good. Anyways, the country was a different animal back then, and through a smart use of selling public land (this actually created funds for the nation, but <em>selling it to the bank/other people</em>), which got around the whole problem I outlined above. We&#39;ve manifested our destiny at this point, and that sum above is far too large to start selling off land again (which really isn&#39;t that solid of a strategy long-term, if you really think about it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, I have a 1963 UNITED STATES NOTE (as opposed to a FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE); can you explain this a bit? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>United States notes stopped being printed in 1971, so a 1963 note isn&#39;t out of the question. Hold on to it! That&#39;s pretty neat and I wish I had one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why was it changed then even though the Federal Reserve Act was in 1913?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because the Fed act was passed during the Christmas slowdown in 1913, it does take some time for that stuff to get into action. The Federal Reserve Notes were gradually introduced alongside US Notes, and they were eventually decoupled from specie conversion through a variety of legislation culminating with Executive Order 6102 by FDR.</p>

<p>Does that help?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think picking his/her brain about the mathematical inevitability of a central bank putting a national government in a monstrous amount of debt (like the example way above about Jamesmarks or the current state ofnIS debt) is a solid question. But it seems kind of <em>out there</em>, as a random question out of the blue that is best served when central banking comes up in the discussion organically.</p>

<p>See if you can contrast the logistics of a government issued, debt screen currency such as Lincoln&#39;s Greenback,  or even an earlier iteration from the colonial era, the commodities-backed Massachusetts Bay Colony note.</p>

<p>That should queue up a good discussion... But I suggest you get we background on those other two if you aren&#39;t aware of them prior to asking.</p>
