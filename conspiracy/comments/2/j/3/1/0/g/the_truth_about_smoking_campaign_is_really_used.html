       think about it. i would have never known most of those celebs smoked unless i saw the commercials. since they cant have ads for smoking on tv they use these anti smoking ads to get it out there. all i see in these commercials is people smoking, not people quitting. next time i see that big black lettering that reads "finish it" i'm gonna remember i'm almost outa reds not that i shouldn't buy another pack.

       That's absolutely true. I had an epiphany one day that it's just this damn propaganda telling me that I can't quit! Think about it - how bad is it really not having a smoke? It's almost
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       . How are cigarettes really that addictive when the withdrawal is so slight its characteristics are barely definable?
      </p>
      <p>
       I threw away my packet of cigarettes that day and have not smoked since. As I expected, I felt barely any "withdrawal". It's a lie. You can quit, you don't have to cut down, going "cold turkey" is neither cold nor turkic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just quit. It's easy. The whole damn thing is a lie to make you think you're addicted and can't stop.

       same here.. I think it was John Stossel who did a show a few years ago about this on one of his "give me a break" things on 20/20.. about how tobacco companies are frequently the ones providing the "cure" for this apparently monumental superhuman task of quitting cigarettes...
      </p>
      <p>
       It got me thinking.. everyone I knew in my life who had successfully quit for any significant amount of time did it cold turkey... no patches... no gum.. no ecigs or vaping.. nothing.. just stopped..
      </p>
      <p>
       so that's what I did..
      </p>
      <p>
       I just stopped.. didn't  even finish the pack on me..
      </p>
      <p>
       minor symptoms.. but brief and manageable..
      </p>
      <p>
       the ads I see for all these cessation products are all just sad..

       My gf and I talk about this every time we see one of those commercials. Every time it says "everytime you post one of these pictures online, big tobacco gets free advertising," I think "WELL STOP SHOWING PEOPLE THEN!" And then we light our cigs up. For the record I'm not trying to quit smoking, I just hate the obvious hypocrisy. It's obvious to me that the commercials (maybe even the whole anti-smoking campaign) is a ploy by tobacco companies.
