       Really, we need to drop "conspiracy theorist". It paints a huge bulls-eye on our backs. Also, CT's are soon to be considered domestic terrorists or extremists. We need something else.

       popularized as a term of derision by the CIA after the JFK assassination.  Just tell people that when they say it, odds are very good that it will be the first they've heard of it.

       But it was popularized and made into a term of derision by the CIA in a memo regarding people who were questioning the official story of the JFK assassination.  I should have been more clear - thanks for clarifying though.

       Unfortunately, saying "the term was invented by the CIA" isn't going to make you look less like a "conspiracy theorist" and depending on who you are talking to, would only further cement whatever notion they have about those people even further.

       I agree. Some people like to feel special and think of the masses as too dumb to get it and that we are a breed apart, but I think we should encourage people to see extreme skepticism toward big corporations and big government as normal. Most people can understand what's going on, it's just that they don't want to leave the protection of the heard.

       Keep the term "Conspiracy Theorist."  Today's weirdo is tomorrow's hero.  More and more people are joining the conspiracy camp.  So, don't worry.  The government and MSM are getting nervous and are trying to rein in their sheeple.

       Unfortunately, the term "skeptic" is no-go. It has already been (mis)appropriated by a group of useful idiots who slavishly adhere to the "official" narrative, and who think skepticism need only be applied to non-government-endorsed, and non-mainstream viewpoints.

       Who cares what you're labeled.  The truth is the truth and if people don't want to open their eyes to the injustices in the world that is their choice.  The fact is, it used be considered journalism to dig deep and seek out the truth.  Unfortunately, this isn't the case anymore.  There is only so much you can do to get the word out.  Many of us just want to be aware of what is going on around us so we can vote accordingly and prepare ourselves for potential collapse.

       If we drop the term we are playing right info their hands by allowing them to highjack terms and meaning for there own purposes and to set the reference point for morality. Instead I propose that we all challenge there monopoly on setting what is right and what is wrong by calling attention to the atrocities the have been committing in our name.
       <br/>
       U.S Government lied when they pushed people to believe them about WMD's to force a war in Iraq / Afghanistan, and the media when right along with it. With that alone neither the government nor the media can no longer be trusted but im sure there are more examples than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should the U.S Government and any media organization who perpetuates these narratives have the right to be an authority on morality while at the same time the commit crimes against humanity and lie to people?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest we call attention to the positive nature of what a conspiracy theorist is by send people studies that proves theorizing is more sane then knowing or thinking you have all the answers.
By trying to control how information gets presented you open yourself mistakes because you are not able to consider the possibility that you are wrong and you won't allow others to question your version of what happened.

       Most conspiracy theorist should be ignored anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Honest disagreement is often a good sign of progress." But many conspiracy theorist seem to look for doubt as an end to itself, instead of looking it as a mean to find truth. And end up making hundreds of "could be" assumptions, based on doubt, which began because of the lack of information.

       Do you seriously believe Randi ever has had even a shadow of doubt in his mind about the outcome of a test before he gives it? And if his mind is completely closed before he tests people, why does he test them, other than to mock them and dismiss them. Hence my remark that he is a "debunker" because his mind is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       closed against true inquiry
       <em>
        from the beginning
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you really believe that if PSI were proven beyond any reasonable doubt, in multiple tests, that Randi would
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       pay the money he has promised to pay? No one is ever getting a dime out of old Randi, ever, and it doesn't matter what abilities they possess, or what they demonstrate in his tests, or what is real or genuine. His mind is as tightly sealed as a bank vault on Sunday.

       Beeing concerned about a term instead of the real issues does not change anything important and is counterproductive. The process reminds me always of newspeak, political correctness and genderism. And I hate this culture of renaming something because it has a derogatory meaning for some people. Name something whatever you want, but the real maening will never change because it is intrinsic.

       I feel the word "skeptic" should
       <em>
        really

       be stayed away from, as that has a connotation of someone who is more of a naysayer than someone who is legitimately balanced, intelligent assessor of the information in question.

       I'd say stick with Conspiracy Theorist and
       <em>
        own

       the term. There are many examples of actual conspiracies in the past and there is no reason to think that they just suddenly stopped.

       I like the term "truther." It's accurate. We're looking for the truth. This term is usually only applied to skeptics of the official 9-11 narrative, but I believe it should be used more broadly to replace "conspiracy theorist". It covers more than just conspiracy theories. It applies to those who shine a light on government corruption and corporate wrong-doing.

       Theory has the unfortunate connotation of "hypothesis", even though a theory is proven - as have been so many conspiracy "theories" that are 100% substantiated.

       I prefer Blatancy Theory the idea that most events are the results of the actions of those with the most to gain and that power in all circumstances seeks to protect and promote its own power base. 
For me it is other people who have to justify their theory when they believe this is not the case.

       It's like most other parts of the English language that has been misconstrued for the someone's benefit along the line and never corrected. A conspiracy is just the past tense of conspire, which is something we all know at least one person is guilty of at one point or another. And for theory, just means something that cannot be proven. It's a modest phrase. But dickheads use it to make people sound crazy for questioning authority. It really isn't that crazy to think that big business plans shady dealings and makes sure it doesn't come into the public eye. It's all fairly logical to be quite honest. The only crazy part is calling people crazy for talking about theory's.

       Its true. Its not unique to this sub. Unfortunately, all of the outlets are controlled so wherever we go (ATS, GLP, Reddit, Drudge, whatever) its all the same articles, the same information, the same AP press releases.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are completely contained. It's funny, but we think we know whats going on when its completely possible that everything even us skeptics believe in can be a controlled reality. We could be completely divorced from what is actually happening and not even know it. In fact, I'm almost banking on it.

      <p>
       this is because we try to link to MSM sources when possible, as opposed to an obscure blog. by anchoring our work in MSM, we can force other MSM to follow suit, in what we have recently been calling a "limited hangout"
       <a href="/r/limitedhangout">
        /r/limitedhangout
       </a>
       #LimitedHangout

       the other nice thing about linking to MSM sources and having toned-down headlines is we have a bit of respectability.
      </p>
      <p>
       headlines like "OMG WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!" would probably turn off a visitor to our sub.

       I use the term Paranoid Conspiracy Theorists to describe people who believe 'The Powers That Be' are out to harm them through chemtrails and HAARP and so on. Calling them 'Chemtards' isn't helpful in a serious debate, even if it does slip off the tongue easily.

       Rubbish. There are plenty of conspiracies which are undisputedly real, such as the Iran/Contra business and the testing of airborne chemical/drugs dispersal in England in the 1960s. A PCT is someone who thinks they are personally a target for such programs, real or imagined.

       So nothing new in 60 years? You suck at theorizing about conspiracies. Are you from the 60's?
