The veil of forgetfullness is used so we get a legitamite experience. This however is the worst or lowest level of existence 3d you are taking infinite intelligence and power and inserting it into these very limited bodies and minds. To add more bullshit to the mix &quot;we&quot; chose to have these rulers enslave us for thousands of years because hey infinite beings need to experience it all and a slave is one of these experiences. However the time for the slave revolt is upon us it is just too bad everyone is complimenting each others golden and platinum CHAINS and dont realize they are slaves to a sick and twisted society based on slavery and subjugation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bibleprophecytruth.com/media-library/study-guide/e/4998?t=the-usa-in-bible-prophecy.">United States</a> in prophecy.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England%27s_Dark_Day">The dark day</a>, where the sun gave no light and the moon shone like blood. Soon following after, as Matthew 24:29 states, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids">the stars began falling from the sky</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_eschatology">Adventist eschatology</a></p>

<p>I believe we are in the last days. The only piece left is the establishment of a one world system. I imagine there&#39;s going to be a massive war to bring about a worldwide consensus of ecumenism and democracy through the United Nations and the Papacy. This sets the stage for power from one seat, at which time the Bible states that Satan shall rule for one hour before the LORD comes. Once it all comes to a head, the books close and our time is up.</p>

<p>The Bible emphasizes, however, not to fear. God&#39;s judgment is righteous and he gives everyone the chance to find the truth. The tribulation is here to open our eyes to the message... In these final days one only need to look around and think critically about what we&#39;re doing to ourselves to see we&#39;re not headed towards a perfect world. When they scream peace is finally upon us - after all of the destruction, evil, and control brought upon the world in the name of democracy and saving the planet is finally over and victory is declared... look up.</p>

<p>EDIT: As for the blood moon tetrad... seeing as how they each fall on a Passover or Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot)... this sign says to me remember the Savior and his promise to us. Remember the beginning and the end. Passover is the day Jesus was crucified... the death of the passover lamb. The Feast of Tabernacles represents the righteous with Christ after the judgment.</p>

<p>This is also a Jubilee year, and God executes judgment upon nations every seven years. 2001 we had 9/11. 2008 a massive financial depression. This year? We&#39;ll see in the fall.</p>

<p>Another EDIT: The first four Biblical feast days have been fulfilled prophetically by Jesus. This leaves the last three, Trumpets, Atonement, and Tabernacles. These represent his second coming.</p>

<p>40.8 Questioner: Then what will be the time of transition on this planet from third to fourth density?</p>

<p>Ra: I am Ra. This is difficult to estimate due to the uncharacteristic anomalies of this transition. There are at this space/time nexus beings incarnate which have begun fourth-density work. However, the third-density climate of planetary consciousness is retarding the process. At this particular nexus the possibility/probability vortices indicate somewhere between 100 and 700 of your years as transition period. This cannot be accurate due to the volatility of your peoples at this space/time.</p>

<p>I do think we are seeing the end of an age, both in a mundane/material sense and metaphysically speaking. We have gotten about as far as our cleverness will take us and if we do not evolve to pair our intelligence and industrial inclinations with wisdom and compassion, we will damage the world so much that we&#39;ll go back to being cavemen. We have a choice to make right now which should have been made in the 70s or even earlier. Hopefully enough of us choose the right path so that we don&#39;t waste too much of what we&#39;ve got. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry digdog303, but the connotation most people have if you say metaphysics or metaphysical is an eye roll, and a ton of &quot;debunking&quot;. I think truly the spiritual or the inner voice is the way out of this mess. What I mean by that is not listening to the &quot;talker&quot; or mind speaker but the part of your mind that is the listener or ponderer. My access to wisdom, synchronicity, intelligence and discernment not to mention other innate ESP increasing while practicing this method. I went from massive extravert to damn near hermet-like introversion within a year. This was after experiencing the universal intelligence and a near death experience on separate occasions. On that side all of this worlds problems seemed trite and infantile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very easily shown by the scientifically accepted phenomenon of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession">Precession of the Equinoxes</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, the position of any given star in the night sky moves by 1 degree every 72 years.  This means that over a period of approximately 26,000 years, the position of the constellations of the night sky will make a complete rotation/revolution (not sure which term is correct here) in our night sky.</p>

<p>The Age of the Zodiac we are currently in is determined by which constellation you see just above the horizon on the equinox at dusk. Approximately every 2,000 years, this constellation changes. From the time of Christ up until 2012, it was the constellation Pisces (which is what some people think the &quot;Jesus Fish&quot; is supposed to represent).  Now, it is Aquarius.  Typically, Aquarius marks the start of of new precessional cycle.</p>

<p>The Mayan calendar is based off of this precession, which is why it ended when it did - it only tracked a 26,000 year period of time.</p>

<p>Please note that in nearly every prophetic device - except for perhaps the Bible, depending on interpretation - marks this time as the end of an age; an epoch in time.  Not the end of the world.  In fact, many of them predict that this is supposed to be a new golden age.  Obviously either outcome takes a long time to unfold; we&#39;re talking about millennia long divisions of time here. </p>
