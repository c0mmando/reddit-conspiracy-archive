       My sister is trying to convince me and talk to me about how apparently the pineal gland is a spiritual bridge, a third eye, a seventh sense, etc. How legitimate is this? Granted, this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       , but is there any ground to this theory, or is it just that--theoretical? I would appreciate if anyone could ELI5 this topic and the controversy/legitimacy surrounding it.

       It is the organ responsible for synthesizing DMT in the body.  Fluoride, among other things, calcifies it and hampers production, which, along with promoting submissiveness and lower IQ (possibly due to this calcification) is why TPTB put it in the tap water.
      </p>
      <p>
       DMT is responsible for dreams, out-of-body experiences, and near-death experiences, which in of itself makes one wonder about its spiritual worth.  It is also present in all plant and mammal life. You could go cut a bunch of grass, do an acid-base extraction on it, and have
       <em>
        an extemely miniscule amount
       </em>
       * of
       <em>
        impure
       </em>
       * DMT.  I am not sure about reptilian, fish, insects, and microbes off the top of my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Every
       </strong>
       religion, from prehistoric antiquity to modern talks about the "third eye", "single eye" or has imagery depicting a pine cone - a symbol for the pineal because it looks like a pine cone.  It is called the third eye because it is
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       an eye in the middle of your head.  It has cones, rods, is part the visual system of the brain, everything.  It is also a theme in many occult symbols - for example the all-seeing eye on the dollar bill is a metaphor for the third eye / pineal gland.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you aren't squeamish about ingesting mind-altering substances, get some DMT off of
       <a href="/r/darknetmarkets">
        /r/darknetmarkets
       </a>
       and try it.  You will not need further convincing afterwards.  I suggest mixing in a (non-alcoholic) drink with an MAOI.  Smoking it is a very, very intense 15 minute experience - as in, you WILL have an out of body experience instantaneously, so lay down somewhere safe - while oral ingestion (only works with an MAOI) is a much gentler 6 hour experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       DMT is also the only known compound which the blood-brain barrier system actually actively seeks and brings into the brain.  Other psychedelics merely trick the barrier into allowing passage via resembling neurotransmitters.

       Im having difficulty finding sources to back up your claim that the pineal gland produces dmt. Ive found info that says it produces many horomones such as melatonin and serotonin, but i havent yet found info on production of dmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, the rest of your claims are backed up by sources i have found. Many can be found within wikipedias article on it:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The gland has been compared to the photoreceptive, so-called third parietal eye present in the epithalamus of some animal species, which is also called the pineal eye. Ren√© Descartes believed the pineal gland to be the "principal seat of the soul" and viewed it as the third eye.[6]
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Calcium, phosphorus,[14] and
         <strong>
          <em>
           fluoride
          </em>
         </strong>
         deposits in the pineal gland have been correlated with aging, showing that, as the brain ages, more deposits collect.[30]
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Numerous spiritual philosophies contain the notion of an inner third eye that is related to the Ajna chakra and also to the pineal gland, and to which is attributed significance in mystical awakening or enlightenment, clairvoyant perception, and higher states of consciousness. This idea occurs historically in ancient central and east Asia, and also in contemporary theories relating to yoga, theosophy, Hinduism and pagan religions, and New Age spiritual philosophies.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Just for a few examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as i am interested in this topic, id like to request your sources.

       There has been no direct confirmation of synthesis of DMT in the human pineal. However it has been found that all the necessary precursors are

       The pineal gland is only speculated to produce DMT in the body. DMT is also only speculated to be responsible for dreams, for sober out-of-body experiences, and for near-death experiences. The only things we know about DMT is pretty much that neurological production is increased in rats at the time of death, and that an increased concentration is found in the urine of schizophrenics.

         Bufo Alvarius Toad

       , also known as the Colorado River Toad or Sonoran Desert Toad, has been found to contain varying amounts of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT">
        5-MeO-DMT

        Bufotenin
       </a>
       (5-HO-DMT). While very different from N,N-DMT, either compound when ingested is highly psychoactive. This fact is likely responsible for the cult legend of "toad licking", although licking the toad itself does not cause psychoactive effects. One must carefully milk the toad's venom glands to excrete the venom, which is usually done onto a Pyrex dish, dried, and the resulting crystalline powder scraped off the dish with a razor blade and smoked. I have even heard of people skinning these toads alive and smoking the skin, but that's pretty fucked up IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Breeding B. Alvarius toads for the purpose of harvesting the venom is definitely a thing among discerning psychonauts, and male/female breeding pairs are legally and readily available for sale all over the internet.

      <p>
       On a side note, the Pineal gland in some reptiles actually protrudes from the skull and has optical nerves attached, giving credence to the whole "third eye" hypothesis as they are literally able to see with their Pineal glands. A very interesting evolutionary fact indeed.

       EDIT: For some reference, psilocybin is 4-PO-DMT and psilocin is 4-HO-DMT. All these are tryptamines, or

       I am becoming more and more intrigued by this topic.. So, could the pineal gland be the explanation as to why someone would have a lucid dream and/or sleep paralysis? I used to have sleep paralysis all the time when I was a teenager and have felt like I've had an out of body experience once. I was unable to control it and was just extremely scared because at the time I didn't know anything about lucid dreaming. Considering that the Pineal Gland is responsible for melatonin and serotonin production and fluoride is in our tap water, most toothpaste and basically everything else.. This could be the reason why so many people have mood and/or sleeping disorders. I swear, I feel like this is just another technique the government uses to control us but that's a whole different topic. I've been reading up on how to de-calcify it-- Just curious if anyone has tried it and if so, do you feel any different?

       I have experienced both extremely lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis,  as well as spontaneous out-of-body experiences, and while I believe the former may have more to do with a flood of DMT occurring,  I have experienced the latter having been triggered by more of a kundalini awakening, vibrational "shake the consciousness out of the host"  type feeling. I'm very interested in the correlation between DMT (as well as other entheogens) and the kundalini experience.

       I did not say it would be good deemsters.  I was illustrating a point.  The point being that it is found everywhere and relatively easy to extract if you find bitcoins and darknets or music festivals a bit sketchy.

       Indeed, however nmt is not synthed in the brain, AFAIK.  I was trying to illustrate to OP why the pineal is important metaphysically not give a crash course in entheogens.

       I also mistyped my first sentence. I meant to say "doing an acid base extraction on some grass would not give you dmt". With enough of everything, yes, you would, but not realistically.
      </p>
      <p>
       You DO get dmt from doing an acid base extraction, just on different materials.

       I've played around with it before, can't really say I opened my third eye, but the meditation  and focus really relaxed me. If you focus on those "clouds" you see when you close your eyes you can try to make out images as you would a real cloud, except these images can be somewhat vivid if you're in the right mental state. You can actually manually lower your consciousness to a deeper state as if you were asleep, but can still hear things around you. Doing this, though, can sometimes cause sleep paralysis, and that stuff is pretty scary, I have an experience with that if you'd like to hear, very creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was browsing nosleep and I read a story about pictures being taken of them sleeping, with supposedly no one awake to actually take it, so a ghost I guess.. anyways, it made me think back to when I was experimenting with this and I recall going through my camera roll with my girlfriend and found a bunch, like a lot, of pitch black pictures. At the time I had no idea, just thought my phone was being odd. I had never had that happen before, and had never happened again. I sleep with the lights and tv off, I do recall the time stamps being later in the night. Man I wish I hadn't deleted them right away, I would really like to brighten those photos up and see if a spirit took pictures of me in my sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would conclude, in my own experience (including my sleep paralysis), that there is definitely a spiritual connection. Really, you have to experience this stuff for yourself, it's crazy.

       Wait, still too scared? Why are you still here then? I bet you're afraid of the dark, the funny thing is that this stuff will help you get over that fear.. because the darkness is nothing like what you'd see in the astral plane. You're body would start
       <em>
        cringing
       </em>
       with fear (if you were thinking about trying) just doing some decent research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legitimate, evil, entities, have visited many different people. Which means several hundred people have seen this exact same creature without ever hearing about it. Look up the "Incubus" and tell me how it would feel to wake up with a demon sitting,
       <strong>
        putting pressure
       </strong>
       on your chest while you're paralyzed, literally paralyzed, staring straight in the eyes of evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently they try to rape you, luckily for you, the orgasms are said to be intense.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're gonna rethink what it means to be scared of the dark.

       I'm glad you think it's funny now, you were probably pissing yourself at the time. I don't know if a fear like that should be taken so lightly.

       I just realized what you said in the last one (sorry, it's a little convoluted).

       So you lost and found your mind after you

       dmt? Oh buddy. Try losing and finding your mind in the "actual" astral plane, while previously laying in the dark, sober. I'd love to hear your experiences if you'd like to share?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should I calm myself? I feel pretty calm. You just seem to think you know so much, so I thought I'd test that.

       I see you completely avoided everything I said, probably because you either didn't have those experiences, or quite literally have no idea what you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you going anywhere with this? Or are you still avoiding the fact that you're too afraid to try it...? Because guess what, inducing experiences with ingested dmt bypasses the fear barrier, so you've never crossed. You haven't the slightest clue lol.
