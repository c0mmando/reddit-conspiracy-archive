    <div class="md"><p>So you reckon Aaron Alexis was part of some psychological experiment gone wrong? Or that he might have been programmed to do what he did? </p>

<p>I am not saying I don&#39;t believe you, but you said that this shooting was all the evidence I need to prove the US government are still conducting MKUltra style programs. Do you mean the event itself as a whole is the evidence, or are there some specific pieces of evidence in relation to the shooting which shows it was actually part of some sort of experiment?</p>

<p>The waivers allowed for normal human research testing gains further piquancy when one considers the kinds of research referenced in the Secretary of the Navy’s memo. Section 7(a)(2)(a) describes the Undersecretary of the Navy as the “approval authority” for research done upon prisoners, as well as “Severe or unusual intrusions, either physical or psychological, on human subjects (such as consciousness-altering drugs or <strong>mind-control techniques</strong>)” [emphasis added].</p>

<p>Read all about the awful truth here in Dr. Robert Duncan&#39;s first book:</p>

<p><a href="http://thoughtlessness23.blogspot.com/">http://thoughtlessness23.blogspot.com/</a></p>

<p>Duncan&#39;s second book is available at Amazon. He was also featured in &quot;Brain Invaders&quot; with Jesse Ventura. What he&#39;s talking about is real and ongoing: <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x18uyto_conspiracy-theory-with-jesse-ventura-brain-invaders_shortfilms">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x18uyto_conspiracy-theory-with-jesse-ventura-brain-invaders_shortfilms</a></p>

<p>Remember, MKUltra Subproject 119 was &quot;the remote electronic activation of the human organism&quot; and high ranking CIA officials have conceded it was only a &quot;cover story&quot; that these experiments ended. That can be found on the MKUltra wiki page. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew this person personally, I worked with him on several NMCI related contracts. He was not a psych issue or a loose cannon. That said, he was very quite and kept to himself, but there are many people in my former line of work just like him. I saw a lot of very strange behavior like physical or verbal ticks, or short term catatonia, etc. There were even people that we joked were secret &quot;Dexters&quot; or the like, but nothing stood out about Aaron. </p>

<p>I would not be a bit surprised if he had been subject to mind control which instigated or precipitated his actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your response. Although I&#39;ll have to take your anecdotal story on faith, I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt. </p>

<p>Also, if you really did know him, can you confirm at all whether or not the stories about his previous history of misconduct are true or not? For example, he was apparently arrested in 2010 for discharging a weapon within city limits, or his arrest in 2004 for &quot;malicious mischief after shooting out the tires of another mans vehicle in what he described as a result of an anger fueled blackout? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t remember exactly when I met him, but it was likely summer 2008. We didn&#39;t work together on an extended daily basis, like in an office setting. Rather as a tech contractor you would be shipped around where you were needed for a week to a month at a time and the team was not consistent. He wasn&#39;t a person I got close to, or socialized with outside of our maybe 3-4 times working together. But during the time we did work together I never heard of any behavior issue in or outside of work. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t up to things, I just never heard of it. And since it is a small world in NMCI if a person was a problem or had social issues (domestic violence, statutory rape, to name a few) people usually found out about it. That I was aware of, he was a normal quiet guy who did his work and didn&#39;t make waves. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really not bothered if the answer is just an opinion (although I would prefer some evidence that shows the shooting may have been part of some modern day MKUltra style program). I&#39;m genuinely interested :( </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2005.</p>

<p>Sierra Nevada Corporation acquired WaveBand Corporation (the company that created the technology) and ceased all work on the MEDUSA technology and did not pursue the technology further.</p>

<p>Granted, that information is from Wikipedia. Now I believe that that is the case though because the new company who acquired WaveBand do not have anything listed on their website relating to the MEDUSA technology. </p>

<p>I suppose its possible that the technology is now a secret. But that would not make any sense considering, well, it was never classified to begin with. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDUSA_(weapon)#cite_note-2">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDUSA_(weapon)#cite_note-2</a></p>

<p>EDIT: I have seen articles on Google which suggest the Sierra Nevada Corporation are still working on the technology, those articles are from 2008 and 2009. But like I said, the technology is not secret and its now not listed anywhere on their website. Which is odd.</p>

<p>Also, the the technology should have been rolled out by now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done a substantial amount of research on this topic, and the most honest answer one can give is: almost certainly, but there isn&#39;t hard evidence that would stand up in a court of law. The party line that they gave up this sort of research because it didn&#39;t work is demonstrably false. I have scans of primary MKULTRA documents proving that they were successful at mind-controlling people and getting them to shoot people (with an unloaded gun which the subject, however, believed was loaded). These documents also prove that they had the ability to wipe people&#39;s memories of these events. These documents also prove that they experimented on children and got them to plant and arm bombs. I&#39;ve interviewed a number of survivors of MKULTRA-type programs who have even more bizarre and disturbing stories, some of which I&#39;m inclined to believe even though I&#39;ve only found circumstantial evidence to support their stories. The point is... with these programs having been so successful there is absolutely no reason they would have stopped them.  </p>

<p>The most recent case which to me is strongly suggestive of mind control in action is the 2002 D.C. sniper saga:  </p>

<p>For three weeks in October, the D.C. area is terrorized by a sniper who kills ten people and critically wounds three others. Eventually the local police chief appears on the news and announces that he has been told that the sniper needs to hear a cryptic message: &quot;We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose&quot;. The police chief urges the media to repeat this exact message frequently. Four hours later the sniper, John Allen Muhammad, and his young accomplice, Lee Malvo, are found sleeping in their car at a rest stop and arrested. Lee Malvo will claim that he was sexually abused and brainwashed into participating in the sniper plot, but this claim is dismissed. Malvo is given life in prison while John Allen Muhammad will be executed in 2009.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some really good information there, thanks. I&#39;ll look into the D.C. Sniper, never heard anything about a cryptic message before, very interesting stuff. </p>

<p>I was always aware of MKUltra, but only recently have I read some of the leaked documents, they were, in a word, insane. Espicailly the one about the women who shot the other test subject thinking it was a loaded gun. And the one about the child who planted and detonated a fake bomb to kill the other child subject. Amazing stuff. </p>

<p>Although 20,000 MKUltra documents survived, I cannot find anywhere on the internet where they all reside. I have only seen three of four. Do you know where to get hold of them?  </p>
