This sub has eyes from many agencies on it daily. You can get them to reply to you and moderate your posts immediately by using certain trigger words.

<p>The best advice I can offer you is money talks, bullshit walks. You&#39;re not the target, you might be a product, but you&#39;re not the target.</p>

<p>If someone can prove that you&#39;re a danger to the status quo, or you give them good reason to believe that - there might be profit in pursuing you. Otherwise you&#39;re just going schitzo. You&#39;re not that interesting, not even the RIAA is in the field anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are easy marks.</p>

<p>Shops with a precedent have very detailed accounts that will go back months. It&#39;s not difficult to do. I don&#39;t work in INFOSEC anymore and I do it as a hobby to keep aware of big things without doing anything illegal. The amount of information they actually give you without &quot;hacking&quot; anything is extreme.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t say exactly how, but you use tools like this:</p>

<p>Find bots you like: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Bots">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Bots</a></p>

<p>Develop some simple macro API&#39;s to &quot;work the page clicks&quot; and be sure and do some reading to eliminate pattern detections by the server. [eg, randomize time between clicks, tunnel through many different IP&#39;s and keep them geographically consistent between your fake entities]</p>

<p>You can use projects such as these if you can create virtual environments easily; <a href="http://kmeleon.sourceforge.net/">http://kmeleon.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>Never run these scripts on your home computer or any computer that you could be positively linked to if you like to trollbait.</p>

<p>I usually have one account that I use for my personal interests; and I use it to have live human eyes on threads. That data I use to train the bots and have them collect the data for me.</p>

<p>At some point if you get good you can sell this data or join a team. Just don&#39;t do anything illegal or amoral. Every once in awhile a company or group is interested in exploring the subject of media/cloud manipulation and they need people who understand how it works. Very fruitful but it could take you down a path you don&#39;t want to go.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I am putting more of my energy into video games and solar power than the industry. Too many lies, and I&#39;m too impatient to actually get anyone to see they are being herded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hang out here all the time and I think this subreddit can be terrible.</p>

<p>Mostly because the mods let outsiders (non-subscribers) vote and comment. It&#39;s not a huge barrier, but there have been many times when I could have voted/commented on a thread in a subreddit I wasn&#39;t subbed to, but didn&#39;t because I was too lazy to sub/click off subreddit style. I would guess that others feel the same- even more so for bots.</p>
