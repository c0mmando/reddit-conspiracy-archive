       Reagan- Responsible for smuggling cocaine into the United States via the CIA creating the crack epidemic of the 80's while touting a "War on Drugs" which has been one of the biggest failed policies of the last 30 years. Liar and a crook.

       Moral of the story. The man in the chair has no power. Only the handlers and the banks control what really happens. The fault isn't on any of them. It's on all of them.

       Aaaand, the American public will still give zero shits because there's beer in the fridge, money in the banks, sports on tv, and a place in their house where shit is flushed away with the push of a button.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could get all these fuckers in one room, except Reagan of course, and make a video of them admitting to all of this. The people will still not give a fuck because they are all medicated and subdued with worthless shit that holds zero value to anyone but themselves. Whither it's cognitive dissonance, willful ignorance, or just plain stupid the American people have been educated with believing what their masters tell them through the television. Also, if it doesn't affect them then they could care less.

       Never give up, just try changing your approach. You'll never get anyone to wake up if you come at them aggressively or challenge their core beliefs when they're not ready for it. They'll find any reason to rationalize to themselves that you're the crazy one and that you must just be off your meds if you believe the US government could ever willingly commit war crimes. It isn't easy, but if you stick with it, the sheeple do eventually come around. I've been seeing it with many of my friends who started off highly resistant to my babbling, but now they're listening to every word and doing their own research.

       Yeah, I understand all of that. I'm just out for finding happiness for myself now. I went through a divorce back in May and have started eating healthy, exercising, reading, and bagged a better job. I've lost 25lbs. already.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I try any waking up I'm just going to be ever so subtle anymore. From then on it's their job, not mine, to be the ones who want to find that knowledge for themselves. No one woke my ass up, I did it on my own. It's just that invisible comfortable roller coaster of commercialism, movies, television shows, video games, and sports that keeps people too involved with mind junk to even think of giving a second look at the real shit that matters, we all know that roller coaster all too well. Then there's those Republican and Democrat people who try to care, but can't see past the facade of both parties in that they are actually acting as one under the guise of two, try showing them a 9/11 video.

       So true dude. So sick of trying to "wake" other people up. Funny thing is, half the people I talk to seem to have an "open mind" about the topics I bring to their attention but also don't care. Like it's beyond them so why bother caring. Where you and I see an issue and resolve to fix it by informing others. A lot of others will see the same information, validate it in their head, and then just sit on the information because they believe it's not valuable in changing things. I understand the feeling they have, but have not resigned to my fate.

       It's wild... Usually if conversation strays to these topics (it's counterproductive to bring it up inorganically), they just stare off into space until I finish the sentence. I had two in one day literally plug their ears, shake their head, and say "I don't want to know. Don't tell me!"

       I'm kinda with Bong_Loader on this one.  I used to care much more than I do now about waking people up; but now, I simply engage with people on these topics when it is convenient for me.  Otherwise I try not to care and I save the extra energy for myself.

       I don't entirely disagree -- you can't engage somebody on this topic if they don't want to engage or they'll dig in harder. I made this mistake when I first figured things out a year ago -- literally sat my parents and sister down with a whiteboard and sketched it all out. Rookie mistake, they're probably lost forever.

       Same. My social circle was cut down to 10% of what it was when I wanted people to watch those stupid ISIS videos that didn't show anything. I had
       <em>
        proof
       </em>
       man, of bullshit propaganda and finally wanted to start a dialogue with something topical that the American public was obviously aware of.
      </p>

       Then I get called a conspiracy theorist and am the designated crazy guy of the group. Because I know how central banks work, and know what the Smith-Mundt Act is. Because who cares about that shit? Demarco Murray is this year's Fantasy Football MVP.

       Hahaha - don't know why but the mental image of you sitting them down and giving them a lesson like a college professor is pretty priceless.  I know the feeling though, I've learned to keep my mouth shut when in "polite company" unless someone else broaches a particular topic.

       It's a strange mentality to have, where you're more of an observer of conversations at social gatherings  than an active participant (what I've noticed, anyway). Then when the conversations inevitably decline (because I'm kind of just sitting there, the group was used to my contributions but I am no longer interested in the NFL or other distractions, so I'm
       <em>
        not really there
       </em>
       any more). But once I became comfortable with it it's actually kind of nice.

       Yeah I know what you mean, I was the same way for a while.  But then over time, I kinda decided that moping pensively in the corner wasn't doing any good for anyone either.  It's a delicate balance.  These days I can still bullshit and have fun when I'm hanging out with friends but I also don't hesitate to speak up when a more serious discussion is going on.

       As cliché as it sounds, the Wachowski brothers' The Matrix really knew how to distill it down:

        It's just that invisible comfortable roller coaster of commercialism, movies, television shows, video games, and sports that keeps people too involved with mind junk to even think of giving a second look at the real shit that matters, we all know that roller coaster all too well.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Cypher and Smith prior to the Betrayal. Ignorance is Bliss.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then there's those Republican and Democrat people who try to care, but can't see past the facade of both parties in that they are actually acting as one under the guise of two, try showing them a 9/11 video.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I guess with the Matrix theme this would be man vs. Machine, being manipulated? I don't know. But this quote is the truest thing I've seen in a few weeks.

       Haha, thank you. I'm just laying it all out man, this is how the world really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're basically born into it and are taught to believe everything your parents tell you, then elders, teachers, coaches, and the news of course. Because all the older people believe what's on the news so it must be true. Its only when finally you hit a certain age of comprehension is when you start to realize that the older people ,who you looked up too, really didn't know jack shit, and were just regurgitating what they were told without question. Like a handed down heirloom, why? Because that's just the way it is... One of the biggest fucking cop out statements ever used, and still used to this day of course... "That's the way it is".
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it really does have a correlation between our world the the "Matrix". I too have often compared it to the movie for sure. I also don't rule out the "simulation" theory either, look up Nick Bostrom if you want to know more.(Although you've may have heard him talk about it before)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm starting to think like Cypher man, and just plug my ass back into it. Start watching sports again and turning myself off to it all... If I don't I will have a hard time finding another woman for sure. I'm very headstrong and blunt about shit. I find myself having a hard time ignoring everything and will probably scare the next one off, lol. I can't even watch the tv for five minutes without wanting to scream, "Our government is bombing people right now at this moment, and all your trying to do is distract and sell me erectile dysfunction pills!!!!".
      </p>
      <p>
       The grand ole illusion. I feel like when you bring stuff up to people they just laugh it off in their head and say, "Haha, they are still showing happy commercials about cereal, oh and re-runs of "Friends" is still on".
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck it. I've got my lawn chair ready for when the shit hits, sunglasses, and my cooler full of beer. Gonna sit back and watch it burn.

       It's just about getting people to question
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       "that's the way it is".  What made it that way?  Did it happen organically?  Of course it didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've found that the most effective way to engage people about these things is by asking simple, direct questions in a non-argumentative way.  Once people get caught in their own illogic or realize that they don't actually know what they're talking about, then they can sometimes "snap out of it" a bit and start to expand their horizons.

       It goes back WAY further than Reagan. There is just a disconnect with people recently that love one of the above presidents while simultaneously blaming the others. You can't like Reagan and hate Obama. You can't support Clinton and call Bush a warmonger in the same sentence. If a person is angry with one, they need to be angry with all of the above.

       While I tend to agree, I think JFK was an anomaly - a "glitch" in a long line of corrupt and "owned" White House residents.

       JFK's "mistake" was thinking that he actually WAS President - that he had actual power and could use is office to enact positive change for the benefit of the People.

       Why do you feel as though JFK was the last "real" president? If it's the silver ceriticate shit that you think redeems then you need to look closer at that executive order. He actually was eliminating the silver certificates. Not creating them.

       Those are not my words, but as I did say, the man actually acted like an executive, rather than a schnook. Unlike his predecessors (and certainly his immediate successor), he had the balls to stand up to some very powerful forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, he was determined that Israel would
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, and as anyone who has been paying attention knows, bucking Israel meant bucking the Rothschilds and their band of merry Central Bankers.

       Here's the infamous Dimona letter.

       (May 18, 1963)
      </p>

       Needless to say the Israelis were NOT happy about Kennedy interfering with their plans - but he didn't interfere for long, and 
Johnson, a life-long Zionist,
       <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/front-page/lbj-and-israel/2008/08/27/">

       It's a very well known speech, its authenticity is not debated. You can still hear the audio recording. What it's about is debated. People think he's talking about communism, not secret societies.

       But the thing with that is "communism" (in name only) was created and funded by the same "secret society"/banking/industrial interests so it doesn't really make a difference.  He was referring to the criminal elite, the globalist cabal.

       What would you say of Lincoln?  The south wished to do what they wanted within their borders and were told by an outside federal force that they were not allowed.  I understand that it was slavery (and by no means condone the subjugation of any entire race) , but what other states have the right to tell another what to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have slaves today in other countries that do our (USA) bidding; for example Third Country Nationals [

       </a>
       ] who cook/clean etc up after our military.  We use sweat-shops in other countries that pay women a few nickels every hour (who work more than half the day in horrible conditions).  There are many other examples of modern slavery like most Americans who live month-to-month.  This is not how it is supposed to be. Yet where is the "north" invading the US to stop our moral oversteppings?

       The State in it's entirety is a flawed system.  Sure, it is said, “democ­racy is the worst form of gov­ern­ment, except for all the oth­ers” ~ but we've never really sat back and tried a no-state solution (and at this point, it's hard to even try it).  Why should I hand over 19% of my income tax (goes to defense) to fund the state in bombing innocent civilians halfway across the world?  Gas tax pays for the roads, I don't send my kids to public school, cops arrive after the important stuff and nearly every other system in place is already paid for; by us (citizens), for us.  The state is just like the mafia... they come around their territory and fleece you for everything and when you say you've had enough/or wish not to partake in their system within imaginary borders - they pull guns on you, rough you up, put in you in jail or worse, kill you.

       This old paradigm is complete horse shit, but people are just too afraid/stupid to want anything else.  Give them their tv, internet and substances and they'll live a 'happy' life.  Caffeine to get through the week, alcohol to numb away any thoughts that may drive you to change your situation.  Until the motives of the people change (and/or are threatened), nothing will happen.  You literally will need to take the food out of their mouths, the internet from their computers and stimulants from their bodies before any actual change will occur.

       So long as we don't come together as one, united people (and TPTB continue doing a marvelous job at making sure that we remain separated from each other, divided, and easily conquered) we will remain as subjugated and controlled as we are...and the defacto answers given above will remain the same, unfortunately.

       Individually?  Some of us are very much NOT willing to continue electing the lesser of two evils.  Individually, some of us (like myself) indeed HAVEN'T done any such thing.  Individually? some of us ARE taking a stand and working against the manipulation going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Collectively, and as a whole, however?  I would say that the majority of us are still voting for presidents and giving energy to the shit system that exists.  How many people are "oh so excited!" about the opportunity to vote for Hillary Clinton, for example?  "First the first [half] African president, and now the first woman!  Oh boy are we moving forward as a people!

       !  Let's hug!"  A lot of us are still generally comfortable in our 9-5s, still generally DON'T have a clue, it seems, and are not generally participating in the taking down of this manipulative system.

       It goes all the way back to the beginning, even thousands of years, but there were definitely some quantum leaps along the way. In recent history, I think it's appropriate to start with JFK and the coup that ensued upon his death.

       It's pretty deep "down the rabbit hole" so to speak.  It's an essay written by a man named James Shelby Downard who has since been relegated to "lunatic conspiracy theorist" fringe status who makes the (in my opinion compelling) case for the JFK assassination being a Masonic "killing of the king" ritual.

       Bush jr was actually close to correct they were actually moved to Saudi Arabia after the cold war. We gave them to small Islamic sects to prevent the spread of the USSR. It back fired massively. There have been hundreds of W70-3's in Israel since 1985 and they have a good set up. They lost a few who knows where they are. They did however have it planned that way in order to station a large number of troops there, but it is for the president after Obama to enact. Well, you will see. Just remember the Saudi sheikhs and our own government create artificial oil shortages, The NSA confirmed the Lusitania and Gulf of Tonkin  were both lied about to enact a war. It goes back further than you think.

       The fact that recent US presidents have made decisions that you don't agree with does not constitute any kind of indictment. If someone told you that the President is a perfect and moral person, they lied to you. The rest of us figured out that being President means making tough decisions and dealing with some serious shit. It shouldn't be a surprise that being a leader means doing things that are distasteful but necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reagan - Responded to the requests from the growing religious right in the 80s to start an anti-drug campaign. He allowed his spies to work with drug dealers in order to gain information and cooperation that he thought was necessary to protect the country. WTF cares? Most people don't like drugs and understand that sometimes the good guys need to work with the bad guys to get shit done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush Sr - The worst thing you can say about him was that he didn't publically rebuke a woman that was giving testimony that helped his cause. I don't think that most people would be offended by that. As I recall the persian gulf war was popular at the time and it's the president's job to do popular things. Every president going back to Washington has pardoned people, I don't think anyone cares about that earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton - Rich people engage in shady real estate deals all the time and no one gives a fuck. Far from a ringing denouncement of Clinton's character. Do you honestly believe that the average American would be outraged because a politician was tenuously involved in a land deal that some people think is shady. I think most people's response to that would be ""Well yeah, duh." And there's no point in blaming the governor of one of the poorest states for not eradicating drug crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush Jr - Got us into the Iraq war because republicans were in power and were butthurt over being attacked by people from the Middle East. Republicans elect people specifically because they promise to go to war and enough of them voted to get their candidates elected. The soldiers who were killed knew the risks when they signed up and most defense companies didn't experience any kind of record profits at the time of the Iraq war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama - no accusations of malfeasance here, just stating that a politician did something other than what he promised during the campaign (wow! no way!) and has implemented policies that you don't approve of. Again, no shockers there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that children are encouraged to look up to the president, to see him as a moral hero who never says anything untrue. Well, we're adults now and we know how the sausage is made. Instead of pointing out things that everyone already knows and doesn't care about, try to find some evidence of presidents committing real crimes, or intentionally endangering the American people or doing anything so bad that the average citizen will actually give a fuck. Until then it's all sound and fury, signifying nothing.

       So your answer is that the leader of our country shouldn't be held to a higher standard than common rabble? WTF kind of shit is that? How can you so easily accept this as your reality? Reality is as we accept it.  This is our reality not because "thats the way it is" but because we have lazy attitudes that allow us to accept this kind of bullshit "leadership" as "just the way it is".

       It's pretty deep "down the rabbit hole" so to speak.  It's an essay written by a man named James Shelby Downard who has since been relegated to "lunatic conspiracy theorist" fringe status who makes the (in my opinion compelling) case for the JFK assassination being a Masonic "killing of the king" ritual.
