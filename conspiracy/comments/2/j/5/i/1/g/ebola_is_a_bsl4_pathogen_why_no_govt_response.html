        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anthrax is a Bio-Safety Level 3 pathogen. Ebola is a Bio-Safety Level 4 pathogen. BSL-4 is saved for the really scary pathogens (e.g. biological weapons, Ebola, etc). When you see people in the movies with space suits and air hoses, you are looking at BSL-4. When BSL-4 stuff gets out of the lab, really bad things happen.</p>

<p>If you get Ebola, there is an 80-90% chance you will die. This is even with the best medical care on the planet. All of our medical science can only sit by and more of less watch you die as your internals liquify and your eyes start to bleed. To put that into perspective, the Black Death only had a 30-60% mortality rate. Yet, it fundamentally changed humanity forever.</p>

<p>Due to the ridiculously high mortality rate. A worst-case and widespread Ebola pandemic could collapse society. This is real nightmare stuff.</p>

<p>Also, Ebola may be at least partially airborne. We know that it can live outside the body for days. We know when people sneeze or projectile vomit, aerosolized droplets will contain Ebola and it can live for a long time. Additionally, we know there is a huge amount of genetic pressure for Ebola to mutate into a fully airborne pathogen. Any genetic change that increases its&#39; survivability outside the body, even slightly, will multiply its communicative potential.</p>

<p>We now have another infected person in the US. There are probably more. The second person was a nurse. She was wearing full protective gear. It didn&#39;t stop transmission. It didn&#39;t matter. Most likely, she will be dead in a few weeks. It&#39;s game over for her. This makes sense because this is a BSL-4 pathogen. Yet, we are being told that it&#39;s her fault. Who&#39;s fault it is doesn&#39;t matter. Not one bit. </p>

<p>By the way, she has a dog. Dogs can be carriers. We won&#39;t know if it has Ebola for a week or so. If it does, then it will become contagious at some point. But, we aren&#39;t euthanizing it. Why?</p>

<p>More of the first patient&#39;s caregivers may have Ebola now. We don&#39;t know. The new patients caregiver&#39;s may get it too. We also don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>It seems like any Ebola outbreak is really serious. Why is the government&#39;s response not more in line with the level of the threat? What motive could they have with being totally carefree about it? Any ideas?</p>

<p>Terrible perspective, our understanding and treatment of complex infections has changed <em>drastically</em> since the 1300&#39;s. We&#39;re not bleeding &quot;boils&quot; of bad blood anymore.</p>

<p>You need to review the definition of &quot;droplet&quot; transmission.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, we know there is a huge amount of genetic pressure for Ebola to mutate into a fully airborne pathogen. [4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do <em>we</em> know this? Do you have a Ph.D. in infectious disease with a sub-specialty in genetics? I don&#39;t (though I do have a B.S. in biochemistry), but unless you do there&#39;s no we here.</p>

<p>But, we aren&#39;t euthanizing it. Why? [5]</p>

<p>It&#39;s because people get so attached to the damn things they&#39;re willing to make an uproar about it. Check Google news.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She was wearing full protective gear. It didn&#39;t stop transmission. It didn&#39;t matter. [5]</p>

<p>She fucked up while taking the protective gear off. Now that we know that, caregivers know to be more careful.</p>

<p>I agree with you, <em>we don&#39;t know</em> but our understanding of how to care for patients without contracting it is improving. But I think the &quot;we don&#39;t know&quot; part is more important.</p>

<p>Before we answer your question, let&#39;s recap your &quot;analysis&quot; thus far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Incorrect research concerning the mortality rate of the current virus</li>
<li>False analogy with the Bubonic Plague</li>
<li>Incorrect definitions of disease transmission</li>
<li>Baseless assumptions about viral evolution</li>
<li>Failure to draw conclusions based on current events and sociology</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to take a step back and review your analytic methodology before you go looking for more questions to answer.</p>

<p>This post is grade A fear mongering, and you should delete it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re misunderstanding him.  Even though we&#39;ve advanced drastically ebola still has a very high CFR.  To clarify, the Black Death had a mortality rate of 30-60%, and Ebola&#39;s is higher despite modern medical knowledge.  In other words you misunderstood what he said to such an extent that your statement supports his position and not yours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>False, it depends on the strain, with this current one being 48% (4,033 deaths / 8,400 cases as of 10/8/2014.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  If you divide cases by deaths you end up with a much lower CFR because you are not taking into account the delay time between case confirmation and death which can sometimes be half a doubling period.  It&#39;s hard to believe but the CDC and WHO were making the same error.  The CFR of the current outbreak is much closer to 80% or higher.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailyrapid.com/2014/10/ebola-fatality-rate-is-drastically-underestimated-by-health-officials-due-to-rapidly-accelerating-spread/">Here</a> is an explanation, though the WHO and CDC admitted their mistake maybe 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p>The current strain is extremely nasty (see Jahrling link) both in CFR and transmissibility, both related to very high viral load.  The CFR of this strain under good care (in african hospitals) approaches early Zaire outbreaks before specific supportive care (ORS etc) were well understood.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should review YOUR analytic methodology.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s recap yours:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 Incorrect research concerning the mortality rate of the current virus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False, as stated above.  Your figures are incorrect, not his.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 False analogy with the Bubonic Plague</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was talking about the Black Death, not Bubonic Plague.  There is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theories_of_the_Black_Death#An_Ebola-like_virus.3F">some suspicion</a> that the Black Death was caused by an Ebola-like virus and not Pestis.  Also the Plague of Athens is theorized to have been Ebola.  There is a great deal of evidence that Pestis was involved in at least some of the Black Death but it&#39;s very possible that there were different etiologic organisms at different times (1349 vs the Great Plague) or even concurrently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 Incorrect definitions of disease transmission</p>
</blockquote>

<p>YOU need to review droplet transmission.  Ebola is survivable in aerosols for up to 90 minutes.  It&#39;s survivable on surfaces for up to 3 weeks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 Baseless assumptions about viral evolution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you&#39;d be more interested in the opinions of virologists like Drs. <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6959087/ebola-outbreak-virus-mutated-airborne">Jahrling</a> and <a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/commentary-health-workers-need-optimal-respiratory-protection-ebola">Osterholm.</a>  Their opinions largely agree with his and not yours though their opinions differ on airborne transmission.  </p>

<p>Also see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/opinion/what-were-afraid-to-say-about-ebola.html?_r=0">Osterholm&#39;s NYT article.</a>  Moreover, you&#39;re not qualified in virology or evolutionary biology so your conclusions are as baseless as his-- though certainly from a risk management standpoint his concerns are correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 Failure to draw conclusions based on current events and sociology</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think his conclusions were pretty accurate for someone who doesn&#39;t have a B.S. degree.</p>

<p>You need to figure out a way to get your point across without being a cock to someone you don&#39;t know.  His conclusions are much more on the money than yours are.</p>

<p>That said, I disagree with his population control conclusion which is beyond absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>False, as stated above. Your figures are incorrect, not his.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you would have bothered to read our thread further you would have found that I conceded the same point (CFR being underestimated) that you wrote a novel lecturing me on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s very possible that there were different etiologic organisms at different times (1349 vs the Great Plague) or even concurrently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s also very possible that they were, in fact, the same fucking thing. The fact is we don&#39;t know. What we do know is that scientists highly suspect that the CFR would be lower outside of Africa, due to the differences in handling of infected materials. Oh and I should mention that I spent 4 months in Africa working in a hospital, so I can confirm that their isolation wards are a joke.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YOU need to review droplet transmission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m well aware of the transmission and it&#39;s textbook aerosolizeable/droplet contamination. Airborne requires the ability to attach and survive on particulate matter. Saying Ebola is airborne b/c it can aerosolize is equivalent to saying humans are fish b/c we can swim.</p>

<p>Your exhalted Dr. Jahrling even admits that it&#39;s not airborne, that the virulence is due to the higher viral load of the strain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My fault, I was talking to MrVand.  I will address your original post.  You were mostly right and justdothemath is wrong on every point he makes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The only reason A isn&#39;t BL4 is because it doesn&#39;t spread very much person to person.  Also there are antibiotics for it and if you take them you will absolutely not catch it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you get Ebola, there is an 80-90% chance you will die. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is correct in African medical care.  We don&#39;t have enough data for case fatality rate under Western medical care.  So far the survival rate of patients in US care is looking very good.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is even with the best medical care on the planet. All of our medical science can only sit by and more of less watch you die as your internals liquify and your eyes start to bleed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually supportive care along with antivirals appears to be making a huge difference.  Ms. Pham will be receiving antibody-rich blood from the awesome Mr. Brantly and massive prophylactic doses of antivirals and I give her pretty good odds.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, we know there is a huge amount of genetic pressure for Ebola to mutate into a fully airborne pathogen. Any genetic change that increases its&#39; survivability outside the body, even slightly, will multiply its communicative potential.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it&#39;s doing just fine by fluid spread there isn&#39;t much pressure for it to change and in fact moving toward airborne transmission may affect its in-host virulence or its fluid transmission, so that would mean that it would have to go downhill before it could go uphill again with airborne transmission and virus evolution doesn&#39;t think that far ahead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She was wearing full protective gear. It didn&#39;t stop transmission. It didn&#39;t matter. Most likely, she will be dead in a few weeks. It&#39;s game over for her.</p>

<p>I disagree, it remains to be seen what will happen with Ms. Pham.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This makes sense because this is a BSL-4 pathogen. Yet, we are being told that it&#39;s her fault. Who&#39;s fault it is doesn&#39;t matter. Not one bit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s the fault of the people who defined the protocol.  Even if she screwed up, the protective protocol should be fixed because it&#39;s not protecting people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way, she has a dog. Dogs can be carriers. We won&#39;t know if it has Ebola for a week or so. If it does, then it will become contagious at some point. But, we aren&#39;t euthanizing it. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because we can get an antibody test on the dog and find out if it&#39;s positive.  If it isn&#39;t, there is no reason to euth it.  Even if it ends up being positive it would be a very good idea to find out whether it is actually shedding active virus.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What motive?  Incompetence.  As Frieden explained, they don&#39;t understand exponential growth.  In August they started to respond to what the threat appeared to be back in June.  Now that the response has actually started, it&#39;s October, and an August response just isn&#39;t going to cut it.  At all.  Because when the August response is all up and running it&#39;s going to be November and there are going to be 32,000 cases easily.</p>

<p>Keep in mind though that normal diarrhea kills a ridiculous number of people in Africa.  Not to compare that to a virus like ebola but the primary kill mechanism of ebola is dehydration and electrolyte loss and if we can keep hydration and salts up that alone should help people survive MUCH longer, and if we can do that their immune systems should generate enough antibodies to drive off the virus.</p>

<p>How do we know this? Do you have a Ph.D. in infectious disease with a sub-specialty in genetics? I don&#39;t (though I do have a B.S. in biochemistry), but unless you do there&#39;s no we here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me explain why this is.  It has to do with evolutionary competition for hosts.  In a host-sparse environment, slow spreaders will be favored.  In a host-rich environment, fast aggressive spreaders will be favored.  Why?  Because slow spreaders will have their hosts killed right out from under them by faster strains-- multiple strains may co-infect the same host and mutations favoring faster virulence (that is, aggressiveness inside the host) will result in more aggressive strains climbing the doubling curve faster and reaching high viral load faster.  </p>

<p>Therefore these will be more likely to spread.  Of course, virulence is somewhat tangentially related to infectivity, except insofar as high, early viral load causes faster strains to be more successful in the competition for hosts than slow strains.</p>

<p>One thing that could mean is greater infectivity in the lung lining.  But airborne spread isn&#39;t necessary to have an extremely dangerous virus.</p>

<p>You meant CFR instead of infectivity (correct me if I&#39;m wrong), but that relationship is not just limited to viral load, it&#39;s far more complex than that.</p>

<p>Some people don&#39;t feel that way and I think it&#39;s very important that people wake the fuck up.  Maybe when deaths exceed a million for the first time they will look up from the feeding trough.</p>

<p>What&#39;s happening here is an error having to do with exponential doubling.  They have largely been dealing with slightly outdated news and death figures along with, early on, very poor intelligence regarding case numbers, a problem which has continued.</p>

<p>This means that any response they engaged in has been insufficient by, say, 2 weeks for front side delay plus the time it took them to bureaucratize, decide what to do, then implement the plan.  That means that their OODA loop was out of date by at least one doubling period.  </p>

<p>They&#39;ve realized that that is the case now but it&#39;s too late, now a doubling period means we go from 16,000 (remember, according to the CDC we have to multiply current reported cases by at least 2 to account for shadow cases) to 32,000 in addition to 16,000 dead.</p>

<p>That&#39;s 3 weeks from now.  By then we will have put up maybe 1000 beds.  I have great respect for what a marine brigade can accomplish but it&#39;s too little too late.</p>

<p>I had swine flu and it was a real bitch without shitting out my esophagus.  Norovirus too.  Ebola transmits a lot like norovirus, and that affects 20 million people here in the US.  And remember that swine flu was killing people early on.</p>

<p>You have the right attitude about not worrying about it too much but at the same time this is pretty serious.  I think in 5 years it&#39;s going to be a very different world.</p>

<p>I typically choose the propaganda route in order to try and get people to start questioning things. Sometimes the American History stuff works on the Patriot guys because they&#39;re at least interested in the Constitution.</p>

<p>Essentially, our message is the same: do not trust those in power, they do not care about you, they lie to you, and do not have your interests in mind. Opt out. Unplug whenever possible. Cultivate local relationships and food with the like-minded, and push for educating others. So I get you.</p>
