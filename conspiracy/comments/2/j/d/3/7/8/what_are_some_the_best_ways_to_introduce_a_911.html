        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I want to start off saying that after 13 years of not wanting to believe it, ive come to realize these past few months that we aren&#39;t being told the truth of what happened on that day. What I have are serious questions that no one wants to answer. Accompanied with a long string of coincidences and a blatent refusal to release crucial evidence (pentagon tapes), how can someone ignore the possibility? If the government can&#39;t release simple video proof of a plane hitting the pentagon,  <em>something is going on</em>. I guess it just goes to show that the media does an exceptionally good job at surpressing these kind of questions. </p>

<p>So my question to r/conspiracy is, How do you introduce to someone the idea that 9/11 was an inside job?</p>

<p>Ask questions. Have them think about something, but don&#39;t suggest or offer an answer.</p>

<p>Give it time, it&#39;s one thing to believe a building was brought down, but the implications of that are immense and it requires quite a bit of unlearning to grasp and come to terms with.
It&#39;s undoubtedly this reason that causes many people to resist the truth irrationally, even when presented with stone cold facts.</p>

<p>On to your question,  how were you approached? I have found nothing but hostility from the ones that are happier being conned than saddle up to the harsh truth that is the reality we live in. Ultimately it is each ones own responsibility to awaken to the lies. The entire idea of government is nothing but slavery under the guise of a caring group of responsible and respectful people who have your best interest at heart. Nothing could be further from the truth. Your government hates you and is nothing but a parasite. </p>

<p>I thought that might have sounded a little cliche. I was just keeping this post specfic. Bringing light to the possibilty of 9/11 being illigitimate  opens up doors to thinking about the legitimacy of todyas events.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I had watched loose change when I was younger, I was puzzled by facts I never new about and wasnt told about. I was too young to understand the links and ties so I dismissed it. After watching the movie zeitgeist a few months ago ( which im not too much of a fan of, lot of misconstrued and fudged things in that movie) it got me thinking and I did research on my own. Then it became obvious. The fact that evidence against the &quot;terrorists with box cutters&quot; theory is suppressed in the media <em>really pisses me the fuck off</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Start off slowly with some of the indisputable facts and then proceed from there - this is my stab at it:-</p>

<p>What do we know about 9/11?</p>

<p>1) Multiple prior warnings and intelligence</p>

<p>On August 6th 2001, GW Bush received an intelligence briefing in the Oval Office warning of an imminent major terrorist attack on American soil involving hijacking commercial airliners and using them as &quot;flying bombs&quot;. See 1.</p>

<p>They tried to warn us. 
Known Foreign Intelligence warnings in the months leading up to the attacks. 
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/main/foreignwarnings.html">http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/main/foreignwarnings.html</a> </p>

<p>Other countries warning of this imminent terrorist attack include :-
the UK
Germany
Jordan
Russia
Israel
Egypt
France</p>

<p>On top of these warnings from foreign countries, the CIA and FBI also had extensive intelligence of their own of an imminent major terrorist attack.</p>

<p>Why was no action taken to beef up basic airport security in the face of so much intelligence?
Why was no action taken to beef up the &quot;over 70 lines of FBI enquiry&quot;?
Why were FBI investigations prior to 9/11 called off?</p>

<p>How could anyone NOT step up airport security in the face of so many warnings and SO MUCH intel? </p>

<p>This was why the CIA guys were apoplectic and wanted a transfer out of the Counter Terrorism branch as per this NYT article </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/the-bush-white-house-was-deaf-to-9-11-warnings.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/the-bush-white-house-was-deaf-to-9-11-warnings.html</a> </p>

<p>And the C.I.A. repeated the warnings in the briefs that followed. Operatives connected to Bin Laden, one reported on June 29, expected the planned near-term attacks to have “dramatic consequences,” including major casualties. On July 1, the brief stated that the operation had been delayed, but “will occur soon.” Some of the briefs again reminded Mr. Bush that the attack timing was flexible, and that, despite any perceived delay, the planned assault was on track. </p>

<p>Yet, the White House failed to take significant action. Officials at the Counterterrorism Center of the C.I.A. grew apoplectic. On July 9, at a meeting of the counterterrorism group, one official suggested that the staff put in for a transfer so that somebody else would be responsible when the attack took place, two people who were there told me in interviews. The suggestion was batted down, they said, because there would be no time to train anyone else. </p>

<p>2) Buildings do not collapse at free fall speed of their own accord </p>

<p>The twin towers collapsed at free fall speed (as near as makes no difference).
This is evidenced by detailed video footage and seismic data.
Buildings cannot collapse at free fall speed without some kind of controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Why was the fact that the buildings collapsed at free fall speed excluded from the contents of the 9/11 commission report?</p>

<p>How were the controlled demolition charges placed on the steel beams in the twin towers?
We know there was &quot;maintenance&quot; work in the weeks prior to 9/11 which allowed access to the steel beams.</p>

<p>Who set off the charges for the controlled demolition?</p>

<p>Building 7 was ordered to be pulled down by Rudy Giuliani.
This building also fell at free fall speed from a controlled demolition.
The controlled demolition charges were in place before 9/11 (there was not enough time to place them in the building on 9/11 itself).</p>

<p>The BBC reported on Live TV, that Building 7 had collapsed while the building was still standing (you can see building 7 still standing behind the reporter).
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s</a>
How did the BBC know that building 7 was going to be pulled before it happened?</p>

<p>We know that there were explosions immediately prior to the buildings collapse; and several injuries from those explosions; in the basements of the twin towers.
Why was this evidence not included in the 9/11 commission report?
Why were the eye witnesses to these explosions not called to testify?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhGcBxONSvc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhGcBxONSvc</a></p>

<p>3) Why were the steel beams from the twin towers smuggled out of the country within 2 weeks of 911? </p>

<p>Never before in history has a skyscraper collapsed just from fire.
The buildings were designed to withstand the impact from up to 6 aircraft simultaneously, only 1 aircraft hit each tower.
Jet fuel only burns at about 700 degrees C.
Temperatures of 1200 degrees C are required to weaken steel.</p>

<p>You would of thought that the American government would be anxious to know why the buildings collapsed when they had been designed to withstand the impact from multiple aircraft.
Why were samples of the steel beams not sent to every major research facility, of major universities, in the US to understand what had gone wrong and to prevent such a disaster from ever happening again?</p>

<p>Why were the steel beams smuggled out of the country very quickly to prevent this from being done?</p>

<p>4) 7 out of 10 of the 9/11 commissioners now disagree with the contents of the official 9/11 report. </p>

<p>The report&#39;s author is particularly scathing</p>

<p>The Attorney General (John Farmer) who drafted the 9/11 report for the 9/11 commission now says that the report is based on government lies and is almost entirely untrue.</p>

<p>(CINCINNATI, Ohio) - In John Farmer’s book: “The Ground Truth: The Story Behind America’s Defense on 9/11″, the author builds the inescapably convincing case that the official version... is almost entirely untrue...
The 9/11 Commission now tells us that the official version of 9/11 was based on false testimony and documents and is almost entirely untrue. The details of this massive cover-up are carefully outlined in a book by John Farmer, who was the Senior Counsel for the 9/11 Commission.
Farmer, Dean of Rutger Universities&#39; School of Law and former Attorney General of New Jersey, was responsible for drafting the original flawed 9/11 report.
Does Farmer have cooperation and agreement from other members of the Commission? Yes. Did they say Bush ordered 9/11? No. Do they say that the 9/11 Commission was lied to by the FBI, CIA, Whitehouse and NORAD? Yes. Is there full documentary proof of this? Yes.
Farmer states...“at some level of the government, at some point in time…there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened... I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described …. The [Norad air defense] tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years. This is not spin.”</p>

<p>5) The 270 degree turn and rapid descent of the aircraft that hit the Pentagon. </p>

<p>Experienced pilots have testified that they could not of made such a manoevre.
How could a very inexperienced pilot with only very limited flight training have accomplished it?</p>

<p>The official account of the attack on the Pentagon has many flaws, the above is just one of them.
The attack on the Pentagon needs to be re-investigated.</p>

<p>6) Condoleezza Rice&#39;s statement that no one could of expected terrorists to hijack aircraft and use them as weapons is an obvious and blatant lie </p>

<p>See 1 above of the numerous foreign intelligence and diplomatic warnings that this was exactly what was being planned and the American government knew it, prior to 9/11.</p>

<p>See Project Bojinka
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojinka_plot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojinka_plot</a></p>

<p>December 24th 1994 - terrorists plan to fly a hijacked plane into the Eiffel Tower - the plot was foiled.
<a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a112496ethiopiaair">http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a112496ethiopiaair</a></p>

<p>NORAD was conducting a &quot;training exercise&quot; on the morning of 9/11 to simulate a terrorist attack involving multiple hijacked aircraft.</p>

<p>The Air Traffic controllers could not tell which were the real hijacked planes from the simulations (part of the &quot;training exercise&quot;) on their radar screens.
<a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/08/norad200608">http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/08/norad200608</a>
<a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/911stand.html">http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/911stand.html</a></p>

<p>Why were fighter aircraft not sent to intercept the hijacked planes?
<a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2011-04-26/why-planes-were-not-intercepted-911-wall-street-lawyer-and-special-ops-hijack-coordinator">http://911blogger.com/news/2011-04-26/why-planes-were-not-intercepted-911-wall-street-lawyer-and-special-ops-hijack-coordinator</a></p>

<p>7) Flight 93 
The debris from Flight 93 indicates a mid air explosion - not a crash landing.
The debris is scattered over too wide an area for a crash landing.
<a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/planes/attack/flight93site.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/planes/attack/flight93site.html</a></p>

<p>Flight 93 was the plane where the passengers attempted to over power the hijackers.
Was Flight 93 intercepted and shot down?
Flight 93 was in the air after the other planes had crashed.</p>

<p>Flight 93 needs further investigation.</p>

<p>8) Saudi Royal Family and Saudi government involvement in 9/11</p>

<p>Inside the Saudi 9/11 coverup</p>

<p>After the 9/11 attacks, the public was told al Qaeda acted alone, with no state sponsors.
But the White House never let it see an entire section of Congress’ investigative report on 9/11 dealing with “specific sources of foreign support” for the 19 hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudi nationals.
It was kept secret and remains so today.
President Bush inexplicably censored 28 full pages of the 800-page report. Text isn’t just blacked-out here and there in this critical-yet-missing middle section. The pages are completely blank, except for dotted lines where an estimated 7,200 words once stood (this story by comparison is about 1,000 words).
A pair of lawmakers who recently read the redacted portion say they are “absolutely shocked” at the level of foreign state involvement in the attacks.
Reps. Walter Jones (R-NC) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) can’t reveal the nation identified by it without violating federal law. So they’ve proposed Congress pass a resolution asking President Obama to declassify the entire 2002 report, “Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001.”

<p>Loose change, the one with Daniel Sunjata is my favorite. Zeitgeist was mind boggling and brought up a lot of good points but it muddied and misconstrued in places.  I felt like it stretched for things. I like the nano thermite theory but im unsure. Mini nukes maybe who knows for sure? All I know is that it wasn&#39;t jet fuel that bought down the towers and diesel didnt bring down 7. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It took you 13 years. It will take some people longer and many will never see it. As for the best place for someone new to 9/11 skepticism to start:</p>

<p>1) WTC 7 - it was not hit by a plane, yet it collapsed at basically free-fall speed. While no one can really say for absolutely certain that airliners could not <em>possibly</em> have toppled WTC 1 &amp; 2 since those are truly historically unprecedented events, why did WTC 7 collapse?? Fire? Lots of steel buildings have been in far worse fires than WTC 7 and have not collapsed. And when buildings do collapse due to a localized failure, they cause the structure to lean, tumble, crumble and collapse in a staged progression as energy from other parts of the building is released and supports are removed. No steel building has collapsed due to fire alone before WTC 7. No building has ever collapse in symmetrical, controlled-demolition manner straight down into its own footprint due to fire or anything else except... controlled-demolition.</p>

<p>2) The air-defenses stand-down on the morning of 9/11. The official narrative tries to sell you this crap about &quot;fog of war&quot;, &quot;simultaneous training exercises&quot;, &quot;confusion&quot;, &quot;uncertainty about who had shoot-down authority&quot;, &quot;miscommunication between FAA and NORAD&quot; and so on. This is all irrelevant. Fighters were hot and ready on the morning of 9/11, ready to be scrambled to handle a real-life hijacking, just as fighters were always kept hot and ready for this purpose prior to 9/11. Fighter pilots were on standby for response to real-life hijackings. Fighters were scrambled as many as 100 times in a single year during the 1990&#39;s. Scrambling is done on sheer reflex, the decision of whether to engage or not is made while the pilot is aloft and is communicated to him in real time. The FAA&#39;s pre-9/11 standard operating procedure would have had a phone call in to NORAD in less than 5 minutes after an aircraft&#39;s transponder was switched off. A fighter can be scrambled in as little as 10 minutes. A fighter jet can fly 2-3 times as fast as the fastest commercial aircraft, making interception extremely rapid once the jet is aloft. Read <em>The New Pearl Harbor Revisited</em> by David Ray Griffin.</p>

<p>On the morning of 9/11, the first hijacking was ascertained as early as 8:20 AM - Flight 93 was not intercepted and was the final plane to crash that day at 10:03 AM ... fully 1:43m from the first indication that one or more hijackings were under way.</p>

<p>The disconnect between the realities of pre-9/11 standard-operating procedure and the perception of the American public about these procedures is responsible for a great deal of mischief on this point. People simply do not understand just how big the lie is. It&#39;s like if there was a gangland-style drive-by shooting on Rodeo Drive going on for an hour and forty minutes, without a single police cruiser in sight, and the LAPD explained this by saying &quot;We weren&#39;t sure who had the authority to shoot at the gangsters, we had some anti-gang training going on at the time on the other side of town, and there were LOTS of phone calls ... it was fog of war.&quot; Everyone knows that standard-operating procedure is that dispatch gets cruisers rolling in the direction of trouble <em>immediately</em>, and then updates the officers as they are en route. Fighter-jet responses to aircraft emergencies, even pre-9/11, were no different. And unlike police cruisers, fighter jets have a 2-3x speed advantage on commercial airliners... this is like the police having cruisers that could do 300mph.</p>

<p>There are many other issues that can be talked about, debated, etc. But these are the two most inexplicable and black-and-white issues. It is glaringly obvious when you look at it objectively. Just sow the seed of doubt in their mind and then walk away. For many people, this seed of doubt will grow into raging beanstalk of cognitive dissonance until, one day, they just can&#39;t reconcile it anymore and they become a truther. Welcome to the club!</p>

<p>on that magic day, the complete innards of WTC7 turned to jello, magically evaporated into nothing, became weaker and less substantial than the exterior walls of the building. so the building &#39;collapsed&#39; straight down in seven seconds with the exterior walls not being damaged by anything except the ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, there are tons of people who are at least opening up to the idea that the government doesn&#39;t have the people&#39;s well being at heart. We can see that every day. It is always a good thing to get someone just to say &quot;wow, that&#39;s weird&quot; and sort of nudge them away from seeing the world how &quot;they&quot; want us to see it. As you nudge people in one direction it has a tendency to have a sort of ripple effect. The key is not to make too big of a splash, cuz then you&#39;ll send people off in all different directions with too much force, causing more irrational thinking in many directions. Pebbles at a time guiding in the right direction is the way to go. </p>

<p>If it comes up in conversation? Or if someone sees me wearing a truth shirt and mentions it? If im talking about it with friends and someone has never heard? Its not like a go around handing out fliers every where I go. Im pretty sure im also allowed to say whatever I want. Would I just bring it up? No. People are sensitive to that issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we should find a way to bring it up whenever it&#39;s organically possible.  Seriously, this crime against the people and the cover up that has followed since then needs to be exposed to everyone and anyone who will listen.  Just don&#39;t start too heavy.  I usually start with MY memories from that day.  I&#39;m 45 so I remember quite clearly being glued to the TV for a week or more trying to find answers.  I started to see even then that the media was manipulating the truth as time wore on to fit the narrative.</p>

<p>thats not the American (or anybody with a working brain) way. and it isn&#39;t just &#39;an opinion&#39;, 9/11 was a crime of massive magnitude.</p>

<p>3000 people on the day, 1500 first responders have died since then from probable illness caused by working at Ground Zero, then theres the unknown number of people suffered and died in Brooklyn and Queens from the toxic dust that blew across NY.</p>

<p>so what brings someone of your tender age and inexperience into the scary/intriguing world of r/conspiracy ?</p>
