Someone there suggested I post to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> instead. I decided to just copy and paste exactly what I had posted there, and I will also provide the link to that post so you can gander at peoples responses there. I did post some rather insightful responses to their accusations that should help you understand further the gravity of this situation.</p>

<p>Take a look at the evidence and perspective with your heart
and your humanity. An open mind. Please read below for all the evidence.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: <em>In order for this post of mine to make sense and due to the nature of this situation to be portrayed properly I&#39;m going to have to write everything I can to help you understand my perspective. So thank you ahead of time for reading this. I am extremely conflicted right now and I have not been able to stop thinking about this and I could barely sleep at all last night.  feel like I need to do something, I have this constant urge to scream for the voices that are being quelled by the legal jargon of the people running McKamey Manor.</em></p>

<p>Two nights ago I watched the very popular 2013 Promo Video for McKamey Manor. While I watched it my friend and I were laughing, scared, feeling empathetic but hell, we just said &quot;hey, well it&#39;s fake right, you know you aren&#39;t gonna die right?. That&#39;s what most people&#39;s first response was, In 2013 it was a 2-3 hour tour. After watching this video I watched some more, did some research. This was the general consensus of people watching and commenting on videos</p>

<ul>
<li>This is all just an &quot;act&quot;, it is not illegal</li>
<li>The people knew what they were getting into, so how could it be?</li>
<li>This guy, &quot;Russ&quot;, is such a &quot;nice guy!&quot;</li>
<li>It&#39;s &quot;cool&quot; that he only asks for dog food can, and a donation.</li>
<li>&quot;Bah, this don&#39;t seem so bad, I could do this, bring it on!* (This is an overwhelming perspective, they view this as a game, but it is not at all a game as I&#39;ll explain below)</li>
</ul>

<p>After watching more videos from the past, and if you wish to appropriately gain the same perspective I have you may have to do so yourself to see this first hand, I strongly suggest that you do watch them. I realized that he is constantly filling his videos with subtle self-preserving tactics that he think&#39;s protects him from the Law in terms of what he&#39;s doing. It just seemed odd, why would he feel the need to do something like this... but it only gets worse.. Much worse. <em>Remember this is before I had come to any conclusions about the guy, it just seemed strange that he would almost purposefully implement things that he thinks would later potentially help him in a court case, and I&#39;m not talking about saying anything openly direct but subtle things</em></p>

<p>Throughout the years 2010-2014 his &quot;Haunt&quot; has become increasingly scary, but also increasingly torturous, I&#39;m talking about legal definitions of torture here, not some kind of &quot;tickle torture&quot; which would be seen as trivial. </p>

<p>This year is very bad, it&#39;s a representation of his growing inner-sadism and evil nature, similar to how psychopathic killers progressively get worse and worse. The tour of this &quot;Haunt&quot; is now 4-7 hours. People who view these videos are seeing a few 3-5 second clips being changed constantly and portray some pretty vile things from 2013. But last night I watched a video from this years &quot;Haunt&quot;.</p>

<p>I am talking about a video between the Marine and someone who refers himself as to a fearless, thrillseeker. These men are by no definition Wimps, and they&#39;ve endured a lot in their life that has made them as hardened as men can be.</p>

<p>For those who haven&#39;t seen it, it&#39;s embedded on this website.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.viralglobalnews.com/entertainment/halloweens-most-extreme-haunted-house-showcases-your-worst-nightmares/19326/">http://www.viralglobalnews.com/entertainment/halloweens-most-extreme-haunted-house-showcases-your-worst-nightmares/19326/</a></p>

<p>I think it&#39;s not back on YouTube as well, some people are saying they can&#39;t get it to work so I don&#39;t know if it will for you. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdAU-HSxRp0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdAU-HSxRp0</a>
<strong>WARNING <sup>^</sup> THIS VIDEO TITLED &quot;McKamey Manor 2014&quot; IS VERY VERY DISTURBING, BEYOND ANY POINT SOMETHING &quot;FAKE or ACTING&quot; COULD BE DISTURBING, IT IS NOT DISTURBING DUE TO ITS GRAPHIC NATURE BUT DUE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE VICTIM AND THE REALITY OF THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA YOU ARE ABOUT TO WITNESS</strong></p>

<p><strong>please watch it now before it is no longer available</strong></p>

<p>Guys, now that you&#39;ve watched the video. You can see this is not at all what the man who runs this place makes it out to be and he is not the man he makes himself out to be. This is full-fledged torture under false pretenses. This is Illegal, Federally and Internationally. </p>

<p><strong>KEEP PERSPECTIVE</strong>: Remember, the clips from all the other videos are all small clips, they don&#39;t give the real accounts of these people. During the video, the Thrillseeker around 18 minutes in, begins to describe very disturbing things. He says &quot;People think what they see online is real?. They don&#39;t know anything..&quot; &quot;This is worse.. this is the worst thing anyone can do to someone&quot;, the list of his pleas continues and if you watched the video you will see exactly what I mean.</p>

<p>Now one of the additionally most disturbing things about this is what the owner of this place begins saying, and how he acts. His tone of voice is not that of a sane person pretending. It is the same tone you would expect to hear from a serial killer, in this case a serial torturer.</p>

<p>He uses subtle tactics to keep the &quot;Thrillseeker&quot; from telling the camera what really went on behind the scenes. He fluctuates between anger, and a playful spirit that is trying to play it off as being this &quot;No big deal&quot; thing, then right back into asking if the person really wants to quit or not, and how he&#39;s &quot;missing out on the really really scary part&quot; that happens next. This is AFTER the fact the victim just said &quot;It just keeps getting worse, and worse, and worse&quot; and how we don&#39;t really &quot;see what&#39;s actually happening&quot; in the ANY of the previous videos.</p>

<p><strong>all this is from the video the owner has decided to REMOVE, which I don&#39;t blame him for because it was an exposure of the truth of his sadistic experiment</strong>*</p>

<p>Now, isn&#39;t it apparent what all this implies? </p>

<ul>
<li>Public Manipulation by Propaganda via YouTube - He ex-NAVY, he is not stupid. He understands these types of tactics.</li>
<li>Pretends that the victims have &quot;fun&quot; and that this is for their &quot;entertainment&quot; trying to assure viewers that they all love it.</li>
<li>Presenting only small % of actual torture, 3-5 second clips versus the reality of 4-7 hours. </li>
<li>Harsh psychological degradation and brainwashing tactics, by the end of this any man would feel like he was helpless and can be persuaded practically to believe anything, especially thing&#39;s they&#39;ve never really fully understood before such as: LAW.</li>
<li>Being conned, mislead, persuaded into allowing full-fledged torture, from start to finish, from the moment he &quot;selects you&quot; you are part of his con. </li>
<li>Using things like Greyhound Donations as a cover and to gain public empathy/sympathy</li>
<li>Use of a NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.</li>
<li>Capitalizing on the victims ignorance of Contracts, Law and Human Rights to dupe people, and the online public, into believing this is all somehow &quot;Ok&quot; and legal, that they have no rights in the matter. </li>
<li>Strong-arming using laws like an NDA to make the victims feel like there is literally nothing they can do about the perversion and criminal behavior they just endured. </li>
<li>Post-Haunt/Torture Brainwashing, reaffirming in the victims head that there is nothing they can do about what just happened, and they&#39;re not allowed to tell anyone what happened. <strong>Notice</strong> There are no first hand reviews or testimonials online outside of the videos hosted by McKamey Manor and one female blogger, who undoubtedly was given a subtle treatment.</li>
<li>No one &quot;Haunt&quot; is like the other, they can choose how horrifically they want to treat each victim, when a blogger goes there and probably tells them she&#39;s going to review, they can at their own discretion give her whatever type of experience they want her to relay back to the public.</li>
<li>Even during her blog review, she said she couldn&#39;t talk about what happened.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to this ignorance, public opinion is easily swayed due to their lack of properly assessing the situation. These tortures last 7 hours, we&#39;re shown 5-10 second clips and we think it&#39;s for fun. But they aren&#39;t putting themselves in the victims shoes, and they aren&#39;t realizing that 5-10 second clips are an infinitesimally small % of how long 7 hours truly is. You will commonly hear people online saying it can&#39;t be that bad because it&#39;s &quot;Fake&quot;</p>

<p>These people do not understand that in the perspective of someone being physically and mentally tortured 7 hours is not 7 hours anymore, it&#39;s much longer. You know those long days at school? &quot;5 more hours? aww man whens this gonna end... this feels like <strong>torture!</strong>&quot; Now.. Imagine being physically forced to endure excruciating torture for 7 hours, and literally have no way out? </p>

<p><em>People can cry, scream, and do whatever they want but those cries are not heard, the only way out is to get to a point medically of such mental or physical degradation you LITERALLY cannot continue without dying. Anything before this point is absolutely ignored, you cannot escape. That is one of the most sadistic parts of this torture, is that no matter your pleas, no matter your pain. *</em>they push this to the absolute LIMIT**, they will push you and push you, and remember it gets worse and worse. You must keep your perspective aligned with the victim, not the criminal.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve established all that, I would like to add that many people online are saying this is legal due to the fact that it&#39;s on HIS property. But unfortunately for him, I don&#39;t think he understands that his &quot;property&quot; does not protect him from International Laws in regards to Torture, which also cover the torture between any peoples regardless of the government, and regardless of whether or not it is in times of War or otherwise.</p>

<p>Read more on this here:</p>

<p>This page <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html</a> explains the Laws that apply to the United States as well under the</p>

<p>&quot;CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment&quot;</p>

<p>EXTRA READING: During his videos you can also hear him get very upset when the patrons are not willing to continue, as if HE is the one who is missing out on something, not the patrons. </p>

<p>These are the acts of definitive torture I&#39;ve witnessed in these videos, a stark contrast between 2010/11/12/13/14, progressively getting much much more sadistic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Waterboarding</li>
<li>Forced to eat dirt with worms</li>
<li>Strangulation and Asphyxiation</li>
<li>Having a working drill shoved into mouth</li>
<li>Humiliation</li>
<li>Psychological Degradation</li>
<li>Induced Hypothermia</li>
<li>Forced to eat rotting foods</li>
<li>Duct-taping</li>
<li>Caging and Immobilizing</li>
<li>Extreme Clostrophobia</li>
<li>Assault and Battery, being beaten by groups of men.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very small list, but remember what the most victim said, &quot;<strong>You think you know what you see online is actually what happens?</strong> You think that&#39;s bad?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s much worse than you think&quot; <strong>&quot;I don&#39;t even think the videos online where real&quot;</strong></p>

<p>This means worse tortures are actually happening than ANY video has ever shown. He uses the video to lure his victims i, he presents and promotes <em>a false reality</em>* prior to the torture.</p>

<p>Listen to his voice, get beyond the manipulation of this, and look in his eyes, his soul, and you will feel his the pain, and hopelessness in his voice.</p>

<p>Last night I couldn&#39;t sleep.. this has been eating at me and I can&#39;t avoid doing something or trying to tell someone else about this.. I&#39;ve seen horrible things online.</p>

<p>I was probably 10 years old when I first ever saw the infamous rotten.com, all the grossest shit online, I&#39;ve fucking seen. Dicks chopped off, etc. But never, in my life, have I felt so much empathy, sadness and fear from things like this. This is too real, and the fact that it&#39;s under the guise of being legal and that it&#39;s on the cusp of being acceptable by some people is scaring me even more. The manipulation, and what I feel I&#39;ve uncovered is a CRIME the likes of which are comparable to Ted Bundy, or some other notorious serial killer. There needs to be an investigation, the proof and the evidence you need is in the videos and the cries of the victims.</p>

<p>Those other things like rotten, I could never do anything to stop, it was disturbing but.. It wasn&#39;t happening anymore or at least I could tell myself that. This on the other-hand is a very, very elaborate crime and a <strong>ruse</strong> that turned that healthy man into a very injured soul, reminiscent of a small child who had just seen something horrific and would never be the same again. The emotional pain, the trauma, the manipulation of this entire situation by this Russ guy, it&#39;s not something I can see and sit idle while it continues.</p>

<p>If you would like more of my perspective I strongly urge you to read the post I made on <a href="/r/MorbidReality">/r/MorbidReality</a> to see my responses to people who were defending the man. Defending a serial-torturer.</p>

<p><strong>It is only a matter of time till someone dies, and it may be swept under the rug, If we don&#39;t do something then we are also going to be to blame</strong> </p>

<p>This must be investigated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo this place sounds pretty fucked up. They don&#39;t let you leave? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No matter how much a member of the public shrieks, cries and pleads, the actors are told to proceed. Russ maintains his crew will only ever allow entrants to depart McKamey Manor once they are on the verge of passing out, or have become “mentally wiped” by the ordeal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mentally wiped what the fuck that&#39;s total mental breakdown shit.
In that vid people were being force fed rotten egg and shit, pushed underwater and shit you&#39;re right this is just voluntary torture. </p>

<p>The dude has reportedly spent hundreds of thousands on this project, yet charges nothing for admission, so it&#39;s obvious he&#39;s motivated by some want to torture people it&#39;s not for monetary gain. There&#39;s a difference between trying to scare people and whatever the fuck that is. This year no one has made it through, but you can&#39;t quit. That means every person that&#39;s been through the place has been removed for medical reasons that goes beyond trying to scare people, how could you be comfortable having people break down on your property under your supervision so much? Unless he enjoyed it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know man you&#39;re getting some flack for this post but fuck it&#39;s obvious these people didn&#39;t <em>really</em> know what they were up for how could you? Then once in they cant leave, it&#39;s 7 hours of legitimate torture.</p>

<p>Fuck that shit old mate is getting off on fucking people up under the pretext of a &quot;haunted house&quot;.</p>

<p>Good post.  </p>

<p>Edit: OP I can see why you&#39;re so keen on posting this about and did the big write up, this is some serious shit. </p>

<p>&quot;Did you guys ever actually do a haunted house? I&#39;m beginning to think that was a ruse to get people to come in here&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I tried to pull off my mask and run but a guy kicked the shit out of me, it actually hurt. I realised resistance was futile.&quot; </p>

<p>People are being tricked into letting a bunch of psychopaths torture them. That shit isn&#39;t frightening it&#39;s terrifying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again man astounding write up. I have no doubt the whole operation is entirely illegal and participants would be found eligible for huge reparations if it went to court. Contracts don&#39;t allow you to break the law, having no safe-word/exit would leave mouths agape in a courtroom regardless of it being agreed to. </p>

<p>Most interesting thing to me is the question of funding and Russ&#39;s military background. I&#39;m not sure if you follow or believe in the existence of (for lack of a better word) mind control, but the mentioned &quot;mentally wiped&quot; state is a crucial step of such practices. During such a state people are <strong>incredibly</strong> suggestible. It&#39;s known that suffering extreme trauma can give rise to multiple personalities, potentially unaware of each other. During a blank &quot;mentally wiped&quot; state (similar to a hypnotic trance) people are susceptible to programming (similar to hypnosis). Basically the process as a whole is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Torture someone until they break down and develop a fractured psyche</p>

<p>Whilst they&#39;re tranced out broken, program them with some kind of instructions or whatever</p>

<p>Program a trigger, could be a word/phrase/smell/any sensory input, that causes the subject to switch personalities upon exposure.   </p>

<p>Lock the memories of the ordeal and instructions within the memories of only one personality &quot;When you wake up you won&#39;t remember a thing&quot; sort of deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blamo, release your subject. They won&#39;t have a clue anything happened. Next time they hear the phase &quot;Russ is a sicko&quot; they&#39;ll trance out and start doing jumping jacks.</p>

<p>The C.I.A loves this shit (MKULTRA), and they love their black projects. It seems possible the could be some government ties, similar to Jonestown. </p>

<p>Remain determined my friend, continue trying to find someone to publish this shit, keep digging. Also not to sound paranoid but I&#39;d recommend you inform at least one person you know in real life that you&#39;re looking into it and have no desire to commit suicide.</p>

<p>Again cheers, this is some of the more interesting things to go on here in a while and I believe it should have gotten more attention, you&#39;ve put a lot of effort in. Hopefully I hear about this sick prick being locked up in the news.</p>

White pride, radical muslims, radical christians,  there are so many hate groups in this country that need to be shut down some dude runing a haunted attraction (which he just TONED DOWN due to the responses he got) somehow becomes your priority of things that need to get shut down?? Thats insane dude, people WANT to do this, hard core horror hounds and because you don&#39;t find that entertaining or fun you want it SHUT DOWN so NO ONE can enjoy it if they like? That is crazy dude, try to see it from an outside perspective.  You can find tons of youtube videos were people enjoy it and say they will come back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The recent experiment of creating the more intense haunt was brought on by visitors o9f McKamey Manor repeatedly asking year after year for a more extreme and full contact haunt so eventually he tried to give us what we were asking for, since then he has decided to scale back the intensity a lot so that people are able to last the full tour and do not need to be pulled out, because he knows that we are excited about the whole thing and want to see it all. Did you watch the video where he insisted that a tour needed to end but the visitor was begging him to let him keep going? That guy still communicates regularly that he is waiting for his chance to return and try again. The people who want to do this are people that have done Blackout or other extreme haunts and still are not phased. Just because this isn’t what you want doesn’t mean you have to make accusations of illegal behavior. I personally want to do this because no other haunt out there does anything for me so I want to be pushed to my limits and feel true fear and this is the only place that can offer me that experience. The owner of McKamey Manor has blatantly admitted that he could not make it through his own haunt and also repeatedly tries to talk people out of wanting to come. He tells people that the videos do not depict at all what you will actually face inside McKamey Manor and that you need to expect much worse than what you see. Lastly, the reason for a NDA is not to silence people from speaking out against him, but to keep the experience a surprise for those of us waiting for our turn. I don’t want to know what awaits me because then I am able to prepare myself. Please just see that this is something for people who are different that you and that does not make it wrong. </p>

If the treatment is as harsh as described, 4-7 hours of torture can easily leave someone in a hazy state similarly known as shock. Dilated eyes, inability to speak properly, hyperventilation, pouring sweat, to name some symptoms.</p>

<p>Per say:
Think about struggling against 40lbs. of restraints, for hours. Being beaten and then dunked upside down into water till you are blackout out of breath. Then it stops. They place you into an empty room.
Psychological security steps in, endorphins and feel-good chemicals hosted by your brain flow free, and you&#39;re at peace again.
A group of guys rush you and beat you down, and choke you for a few minutes.
Adrenaline spikes.
This can go on for hours.
By then your system would be flooded with natural uppers and downers from physical and psychological strain, your body can&#39;t help but try and regulate itself. You&#39;re in shock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 4chan board may have revealed something extremely interesting this morning. If you go to McKamey&#39;s video of the Travel Channel&#39;s &quot;Halloween&#39;s Scariest&quot; footage, the man who comes out of the door with the chainsaw around the 7:00 minute mark sure does bear a striking resemblance to the Marine.</p>

<p>Now, combine that with the fact that the Marine and the Adrenaline Junkie never met each other prior to attending the house. Then consider that at the end, McKamey teases and prods the Adrenaline Junkie (the man who was severely beaten down both mentally and physically, mind you) to try to get him to continue, but the shivering marine with an unmarred face gets the plug pulled on him.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talk about fear mongering. The video was never deleted first off. Second this was an experiment to push people to the limits of fear, Russ admits it was a failed experiment in his videos. It&#39;s being severely toned down back to the 12&#39; days. Just because you don&#39;t like being scared doesn&#39;t mean you gota try and ruin it for everyone. </p>

<p>Make sure you edit this post with your mistakes and add the new videos Russ posts (almost daily.) Some people enjoy being afraid and testing their limits. They don&#39;t try and ruin your fun, stop trying to ruin theirs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t an Ad. How&#39;s this sound? You stop coming to my posts and spamming them with baseless assumptions and slander? Perhaps I should accuse you of working for McKamey Manor and trying to keep me quiet? I won&#39;t because that would be pretty fucking erroneous, it would be pretty stupid huh, well thats pretty much the same thing you&#39;re doing to me except I can see perfectly why it would be stupid and incredulous for me to do that; so I&#39;d rather not. You on the other hand seem to have no problem making baseless claims.</p>

<p>I only posted this on ONE other sub, hardly spamming, secondly I onIy posted this here after following someone&#39;s suggestion.</p>

<p>Now let me ask you what&#39;s worse. </p>

<p>Me accusing somebody who&#39;s clearly guilty of illegal torture amongst other things and trying to help stop there being more victims of torture and potentially a future murder </p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>You berating me like a flagrant asshole making hair-brained assumptions like this post being an Ad, and that I must have ADHD because I try to elaborate my perspective as best as possible? </p>

<p>Perhaps yes I could have written this another way that you would have approved of, but I didn&#39;t now you were the authority on the matter, in fact I didn&#39;t even know you existed at all. Next time ill make sure to consult you first, dick.</p>

<p>Now how bout instead of being a random contrarian punk, you contribute or GTFO with your baseless slander.</p>

<p>Just because you think no one cares doesn&#39;t mean everyone doesn&#39;t care. Now go do something productive, maybe watch the videos and see what&#39;s you going on, then come back and contribute an actual opinion instead of your baseless inane drivel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The recent experiment of creating the more intense haunt was brought on by visitors o9f McKamey Manor repeatedly asking year after year for a more extreme and full contact haunt so eventually he tried to give us what we were asking for, since then he has decided to scale back the intensity a lot so that people are able to last the full tour and do not need to be pulled out, because he knows that we are excited about the whole thing and want to see it all. Did you watch the video where he insisted that a tour needed to end but the visitor was begging him to let him keep going? That guy still communicates regularly that he is waiting for his chance to return and try again. The people who want to do this are people that have done Blackout or other extreme haunts and still are not phased. Just because this isn’t what you want doesn’t mean you have to make accusations of illegal behavior. I personally want to do this because no other haunt out there does anything for me so I want to be pushed to my limits and feel true fear and this is the only place that can offer me that experience. The owner of McKamey Manor has blatantly admitted that he could not make it through his own haunt and also repeatedly tries to talk people out of wanting to come. He tells people that the videos do not depict at all what you will actually face inside McKamey Manor and that you need to expect much worse than what you see. Lastly, the reason for a NDA is not to silence people from speaking out against him, but to keep the experience a surprise for those of us waiting for our turn. I don’t want to know what awaits me because then I am able to prepare myself. Please just see that this is something for people who are different that you and that does not make it wrong. </p>

Americans are so paranoid and into all kinds of conspiracy theories because they have to much time on their hands, this haunt is not nearly as bad as you make it hence why they forced you into the conspiracy theory sub.. makes 100% perfect sense champ ;)</p>
