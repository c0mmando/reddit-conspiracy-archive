        US Army troops
       </a>
       who were recently sent to Africa to contend with the Ebola threat are to be "exposed" to this Ebola virus, and these troops will be injected with the a new experimental Ebola vaccine. (

      </p>
      <p>
       The anti-Ebola vaccine will be given to these US soldiers in Africa, and this vaccine will also

        contain a "trigger" element.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The soldiers will come home and many of them will be discharged and they will be dispersed to all areas of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile,
       <strong>
        fear propaganda will make the rest of the population
        <em>
         demand
        </em>
        a vaccine to "contain the contagion".

       People will line up to get their death sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pathogens will later be released into the atmosphere around August 2016, perhaps in chemtrails  and/or in ground releases, such as in the subway systems of major cities. The latter plot has already been perpetrated in the New York City subway system when they released the Serratia Marcescens bacteria, which was encapsulated in light bulbs and tossed into the subways. This diabolical plot is documented in the book,
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clouds-Secrecy-Armys-Warfare-Populated/dp/082263001X">
        CLOUDS OF SECRECY
       </a>
       , by Prof. Leonard Cole of Rutgers University.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The vaccine and pathogen release will be spaced far apart so you won't make the connection.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason the pathogen will be released later is so that the criminals in charge of this genocide won't be at risk from an unpredictable epidemic which they have no control over. Having a date set will give them the time they need to "run for the hills" or get into their Deep Underground Military Bases( D.U.M.Bs) until the dust settles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trigger element planted in the vaccines will then "recombine" in their bodies with the pathogen that is to be released. This will make you zombie-like (understand the Hollywood obsession with zombies lately?).
      </p>
      <p>
       The product of this recombination of the pathogen and the trigger element
       <strong>
        will result in a deadly biological weapon of mass extermination
       </strong>
       , calculated and designed to go airborne and thus, to be highly contagious.

      </p>
      <p>
       The New Ebola caused by the vaccine will be spread through the air and physical contact. There will be a push for a cashless society to prevent contagion by passing on paper money, so the chip will be introduced (Mark of the Beast, anyone?) for buying and selling.

       A Batman comic from 1996, foretelling in a symbolic story line, this same genocidal plot for mass extermination. In the comic, the flu vaccine contains the trigger element which and when injected into thousands of victimized vectors, will recombine within the bodies of some of these vectors to make the lethal-but-non-contagious virus (to be released) which will become an airborne mutant of that virus.

       Reporters have confirmed that the

      </p>
      <p>
       When the time comes, the pathogen will be released, triggering the New Ebola, which will be airborne and highly contagious. This will generate an epidemic never seen before, making whole cities go into Martial Law or

You disregard this manufactured crisis, avoid the antivirus and get on with your life, hoping you won't get stuck in a quarantined zone under Martial Law "for your safety".

      <p>
       If that happens, you're screwed either way because they'll force you to take the vaccine, game over. The only solution is to get out of the city when the media begins reporting on how "out of control it is", or leave the country all together when they start enacting Martial Law across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       About those "lists", they'll be going through those with a fine toothed comb to eliminate all dissent and resistance, and to remove all firearms from quarantined locations "for your safety", again.

       I made this comment 2 months ago when the ebola fear was still young:
      </p>
      <p>
       Read this on a blog in reference v to the Ebola outbreak:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I want to introduce you to TEKMIRA, a pharmaceutical company that is a self-proclaimed world leader in RNA interference (RNAi) delivery technology via nanotechnology.  INTERPRETATION:  genetic manipulation using nanotechnology.  Why am I telling you this?  Would it raise any suspicions on your part to know that TEKMIRA just received a $1.5 million cash contribution from Monsanto?  Or that one of their partners is Bristol-Meyers Squibb?  Or that this same pharmaceutical company also received a $140 million contract from the Department of Defense, and was granted a Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the development of its vaccine TKM-Ebola
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       TL; DR: mansato and the DoD, have paid a genetic altering nanotechnology company to develop a vaccine for this "outbreak" I wouldnt be surprised for some new strain of Ebola to blow up in the states, allowing the government to force administer a vaccine that has nanotechnology piggy backing on the top of it. They are essentially generating fear unitl it reaches an apex, where everyone is walking aound with mask and gloves, then they will introduce this vaccine.

       I think the H1N1/Swine Flu were a sort of "booster" shots to keep the catalyst going in your system so this Ebola vaccine will be final. They didn't have their ducks in a row like they do now to make the plan go forward.

       It's OK to speculate, but only to figure out what you want to investigate.

       You are off the deep end man. This is a hypothesis, not a theory. A theory is based in fact and source. You just pull stuff out of your ass, and are somehow convinced of it, or like to write bullshit and post it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a very convoluted line of thinking you're putting forth. Might there be some truth in some of the thought? Hard to say right now from this vantage point. If you have some facts though, you should share them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all seriousness, you should probably spend a little less time on the computer, and honestly assess if you need mental help. Ask people around you what they think.

       The reason I'm chiming in is because you were a total dick in the way you responded to something I wrote a couple days back. In fact, you were the one trolling me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I started noticing that you repost the same shit again and again, whether or not it gets any traction. It's really obnoxious because it pushes down topics from posters who don't crassly repost the same blather over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Figure out a way to base what you're saying in fact, and source it. Otherwise, you're really hurting the sub and looking like a crackpot, or as though you're fake and
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to discredit the sub.

       Hey, if you are legitimate in intent with the things you're posting, consider the fact that the way you're doing it makes it look as though you're a shill meant to discredit the very views you espouse. It's not that things you're saying are so impossible, but the way you write it all as though it's a certainty while providing next to no facts, simply makes you look like a shill or a nut.
