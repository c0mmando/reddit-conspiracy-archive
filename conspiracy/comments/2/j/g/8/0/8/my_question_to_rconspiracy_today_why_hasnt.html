       Well! Yesterday I was really happy that I got a lot of responses on my last question (what are some of the best ways to introduce someone to a 9/11 theory?). That was my first post to r/conspiracy and I'm and glad it went well. Im asking these questions not so much for the answers but to see a consensus and start discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       On to the subject. It's baffled me that both Snowden and Assange haven't touched the issue yet. I read somewhere that Snowden had his hands on some 9/11 documents that he shared with Russia (not 100% certain, was a while ago. If anyone knows what I'm talking about). I've heard the term "hangout" be used to describe both of them. Not sure what that really means either.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, r/conspiracy, why do you think Snowden and Assange haven't touched 9/11? What could happen if they did?
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys rock! Keep thinking freely.

       I think it's just too hot a potato to touch. I fully think 9/11 was an inside job, but if I were in Snowden's shoes I would risk many people dismissing what I have to say about NSA spying if I focused on that. There are lots of such close-minded people, like I used to be.

      <p>
       Just that Snowden is supposedly a limited hangout because either one of two reasons, or both of them: not all the documents have been released
       <sup>
        <strong>
         1
        </strong>
       </sup>
       and what has come out hasn't been "juicy" or scandalous enough for what people expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       <sup>
        <strong>
         1
        </strong>
       </sup>
       - I put this here because it's important to note that the situation could be and probably is, more nuanced. Snowden doesn't actually have any access to
       <em>
        release
       </em>
       the documents himself right now, and it's quite possible Glenn Greenwald was paid off by PayPal's CEO (Omidyar or something) in a deal to get to release only minor amounts of the documents trove. He did get paid about $250MILLION as part of a deal to be part of a newly founded online news site or some such. It's also important to note that he's been cooperating with the USG in terms of releases, and this might have gone from the regular procedural "make sure to blank these names" which is totally reasonable, to having Greenwald straight out nixing lots of documents from ever being released.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find the above explanation about Greenwald most likely of all, and think Snowden legitimately got the docs wholesale or whatever (i.e., no handlers) and just passed them off, and now is essentially out of the game unless he goes nuclear and releases everything, since he can't really do all the procedural editing of documents himself, nor participate in meetings with the USG to get that done. I basically think that Greenwald got greedy
       <em>
        after the fact
       </em>
       , and Snowden wasn't necessarily involved in that at all, nor in some sort of overly complex psy-op.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finally the fact that no 9/11 documents have been released is actually a point in favor of the hypothesis that Greenwald took the billionaire (pro-mass-surveillance) Omidyar's deal to shut him up rather than out of any desire to do journalism with such a pro-fascism billionaire, not a point in favor of a hypothesis about Snowden, because he doesn't have capability to release those details without sounding like an unfounded crackpot, without backup from Greenwald, who is potentially compromised.

       meh. disagree.  greenwald has brought a global debate on the topic of "security".  had he mentioned anything about 9/11, greenwald's reputation would have been burned to ashes.

       no-one has the capability to release those details without sounding like an unfounded crackpot.  unless the data is rock-solid, in which case, anyone can do it... including Snowden.

       I actually agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they should be actually commenting on 9/11, I was speaking more to the lack of documents relating to evidence from that time period.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally doubt there are any bombshells at all. What I do think is possible is that there are documents which relate to minor procedural details, which due to the massive gaping inconsistencies that are present in the "official story" would serve to further discredit the bullshit narrative and perhaps shed some additional light on what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conversation is much less interesting if the question is just
       <em>
        "Why don't Snowden or Greenwald personally say their opinion on 9/11?"
       </em>
       because the answer is that it would be foolish to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The better question is why aren't there any documents that may have those tiny links, which when taken in light of existing evidence, can be used to further discredit and put into doubt the bullshit "official story".

       Its like if they knew the world was flat.. if they came out and tried to convince people they would be labeled as 'Conspiracy Theorists' like the rest of us (not saying the world is flat - although.. there is a few questions about that one) anyway - point is they need to have a large enough foothold on the populous to come out with bigger more unbelievable truths. otherwise their stories would be swept under the rug and no one would believe them anyway. (ps getting an agreeable view on r/conspiracy wouldn't be big enough for the impact they are trying to make so the fact that people here would believe is irrelevant)

       I agree with you. I do think that maybe if he were to come out with something, indeed he might loose some people when it comes to the NSA. However that could that be outweighed by the number of people influenced to start asking questions about 9/11. 
So with that said, would it be much better if Assange were to come out with something instead? He might not have as big of an audience, but I think him being known as more audacious might actually swing in his favor.

       They have evidence about all of the NSA stuff. Maybe they just doesn't have any hard evidence about 9/11 that isn't already out there. If that's the case, why say anything that can't be substantiated with cold hard facts.

       He isn't basing that argument on any classified information he may have come across, but rather on the information that has come out publicly about our intelligence knowing about the hijackers and how the NSA programs didn't stop the boston attack even after receiving specific information about the perpetrators from russia.

       He had to have access to all the Able Danger information. Scott Bennett says that he was in touch with Snowden during the time he blew the whistle on UBS and met Brad Birkenfeld (both thrown in jail at the time). According to Tony Shaffer in his book Operation Dark Heart, the DIA, NSA and MIDB were all aware of the active tracking of Mohammed Atta and the "Brooklyn Cell" as well as Urban Moving Systems. More info here:

       At the very least, Snowden is referring to Able Danger and the Phoenix Memo when he says that the NSA had foreknowledge of 911. Thomas Drake has corroborated this as well:

       Amazing, but more just strange.  As JumboReverseShrimp mentioned earlier "no sane person who's spent ten minutes investigating 9/11 can believe the government story" - so how can someone who knows there are cover ups and exposes them think that 9-11 wasn't covered up?!  As if it stops there because that is to extreme.  That does make me question Assange.

       Just because they have handed information to the public domain doesn't mean they have ALL information that exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone came forward with documentation of 9/11 lies, wikileaks would first have to verify its authenticity before releasing it. Journalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple answer is, nobody has come forward yet. If and when someone does hand over damaging evidence that can be verified, then it would be released. As with 'collateral damage' and 'cablegate', wikileaks didn't just publish it. They extensively investigated and researched the claims given to them in documentation/video in order to verify that it was a legitimate leak.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a logical view, you certainly can show that 9/11 was an inside job of the Bush administration. I personally believe this is the case, but i (or anyone else) cannot verify it as 100% fact unless we have hard hitting documentation, transcripts, witnesses of recorded conversations, etc it will easily be dismissed by many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas MSM (the mockery of journalism) rarely investigates, and constantly has headlines containing questions and articles of rubber crocodiles floating around mountain rivers (claimed as actual crocodiles) because they do not verify their sources or information.

       Essentially, yes. A limited hangout is a phrase that's used (coined by Nixon no less) to describe the admittance of part of classified information to make you believe it's the whole story and not probe any further.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Daniel Ellsberg (born April 7, 1931) is an activist and former United States military analyst who, while employed by the RAND Corporation, precipitated a national political controversy in 1971 when he released the Pentagon Papers, a top-secret Pentagon study of U.S. government decision-making in relation to the Vietnam War, to The New York Times and other newspapers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Pentagon Papers were "secret files" that gave the "official" history of the Vietnam War.
      </p>

       But Ellsberg was a Limited Hangout.

      <p>
       Prouty deduced that General Ed Lansdale was part of the JFK assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ellsberg worked for Lansdale who created
       <a href="http://www.douglasvalentine.com/the_phoenix_program_11712.htm">
        the Phoenix Program
       </a>
       :  a program to assassinate society's leadership all the way down to judges, doctors, teachers, lawyers, and anyone with leadership qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Phoenix Program later re-surfaced in Latin America as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor">
        "Operation Condor"

      <p>
       Snowden's files are exactly parallel and analagous to Ellsberg's Pentagon Papers:
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden's files are feeding us an "official history" of what the NSA is up to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ellsberg's Pentagon Papers told us the story of Vietnam -- without mentioning the CIA role in the Phoenix Program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ellsberg's Pentagon Papers "sanitized" the story of Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>

       What if that "military rule" Pentagon military coup is also accompanied by the NSA's own Operation Condor: assassinating U.S. judges &amp; writers &amp; professors &amp; musicians &amp; labor leaders &amp; filmmakers &amp; anyone who will create a voice of dissent against a Pentagon takeover?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Snowden-as-Ellsberg is simply a logical conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not what Snowden is "revealing".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's what Snowden is NOT revealing:  the parameters of discourse have been defined for you by Snowden.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not looking farther, because Snowden already "has the keys to the kingdom" you're told.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the definition of a Limited Hangout.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beware:  A limited hangout does NOT mean Snowden is aware of his role:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Snowden need not be aware of his role.  He could be a "witting collaborator" or an "unwitting collaborator" or a "partially-witting collaborator".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He is expendable, whether or not he is "witting" and aware of his role.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I would expect to see him betrayed spectacularly, or even assassinated, for the purposes of lending his story "authenticity".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The bottom line of a limited hangout is to feed previously unexposed SECRETS that will stop the public from looking farther.  By definition, if Snowden has "the keys to the kingdom," then we are told "there's no need to look farther."

       A limited hangout occurs when someone is trying to hide, for example a "level 100" wrong by revealing only a "level 10" wrong and passing that off as "all there is".  The "hang out" is the revealing that one DID do something wrong, but it's a "limited" hangout because the entire truth of the matter isn't revealed.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's certainly part of it - yes.  The limited hangout can be used to distract from a more important topic by revealing only a slight wrong elsewhere, or it can be used as a ruse to distract from the actual issue in question by preventing one from realizing that the problem is BIGGER and more dire than what is being revealed - which I think is the case w/the Snowden leaks, btw.

       When Ben Rich - the former President and CEO of the Lockheed Skunkworks - said "We now have the technology to take ET home", he wasn't really being metaphorical.  And that was back in
       <em>
        1995

       that he said that - almost twenty years ago when he made that statement.  Think about what is likely available today.

      <p>
       He serves the useful purpose of satisfying public desire to know what the intelligence agencies are up to. When in reality he is merely scratching the service. His leaks only confirm what many of us suspected already.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other useful purpose for Snowden is that his leaks dissuade people from stepping out of line and hunting out or publishing information that they don't want circulated - as we are constantly being reminded that we are under complete surveillance at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads to self-censorship as most people are afraid of the consequences. For example: recent Snowden leaks revealed people who search for privacy software are put on a list. I haven't worded this the best as I'm tired but I think you get the gist.

       Doubtful. I would say Russian intelligence already knows a lot more than anything Snowden has revealed. If Snowden is genuine then he would not work with them anyway. He consistently challenges anyone to present any evidence of this when they attempt to smear him. I think Russia gains enough in terms of PR by just giving him somewhere to reside. A man persecuted for revealing wrong-doing has to flee the 'beacon of freedom' that is the US to go live in Russia. That's gold!

       Amusingly, that's what the 'tards (conspiratards have a thread about this one) are categorically saying everyone here thinks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't think that's the crux of the idea - it's not like anyone expects there to be NSA documents about planning 9/11 - that's absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is more that there should be documents from
       <em>
        that time period
       </em>
       which, when taken with existing evidence, may shed new light on the subject. There are so many inconsistencies in the official story that there doesn't
       <em>
        need to be
       </em>
       any glaring evidence, because it's actually easier to further discredit it by finding additional boring procedural style evidence that exposes glaring flaws in the official story.

       I imagine because 9/11 is outside their expertise. Snowden worked for US intelligence agencies for almost a decade, so he can speak from an educated perspective on their activities. Assange is a (former) hacker who now edits and releases leaks from other people. He's probably never received any verifiable documentation related to 9/11. If 9/11 was a conspiracy perpetrated by US persons, I doubt there'd still be a paper trail to follow, if there ever was one.

       Much what Snowden leaked was already discussed here, but sadly it was limited to conspiracy forums, as no one had the whole puzzle, just pieces (secret NSA server rooms, Petraeus sex scandal, etc). Luckily with Snowden, the surveillance state is not another "tin foil hat" conspiracy theory, but a fact. It has entered public discourse, companies and governemnts are already taking measures to circumvent the Five-Eyes. 
Lastly, don't forget that 6 months prior to Snowden's leaks, everyone was cheering America (and UK, Australia, Google) for saving our "internet liberties and freedoms" from the evil KSA, Russia, China, and the UN during the WTIC-2012 !!!

       <strong>
        As for Assange:
       </strong>
       I think CIA/Mossad has threatened to assassinate Assange's Mother and/or Son if Assange releases anything that portrays Israel negatively.  (You will notice that it's not just "9/11", but further... Assange NEVER releases ANYTHING that paints Israel in a significantly negative light.)
      </p>

       <strong>
        As for Snowden/Greenwald:
       </strong>
       This crew has definitely stepped on Israel's toes -- but carefully -- having named Israel as the recipient of NSA "raw data" (which is a HUGELY significant &amp; under-reported truth).  But generally speaking, I think Israel has become the Lord Voldemort (i.e., "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named") of global politics.  9/11 is simply out of the question.  If that "unspoken" code is broken, the wrath is basically terminal -- if not physically, then "reputationally" for certain.

       Assange has said that he has documents concerning Israel, but the newspapers are not interested in them.

       Could be things about 9/11, could be MK-ULTRA mind control stuff and/or the extent that it's used or the extent of its technological capability, could be pedophile ring stuff, could be anything regarding advanced space technology or HAARP or any other technology that's far in advance of the public sector, could be information about DUMB's.  Could be something even more exotic or esoteric.

       I don't know, I'm with you - it's really hard to say.  But
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       Snowden is part of a larger "limited hangout" psy-op then
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       pretty huge is being kept from us.
