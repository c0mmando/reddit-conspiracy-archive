       I'm just finishing watching 'Adolf Hitler - The Greatest Story NEVER Told' , and I've checked out many other alternative history sources.  This is my quick summary of WWII related death camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Germany and the USSR each had millions of people in prison camps.  Hatred of Jews was a pillar of Hitler's worldview, and pervaded the land he ruled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews were systematically removed from German society, the wealthiest relocating before the shit hit the fan, others fleeing in desperation, and the majority of the poor masses of Jews without the means to escape ending up in camps.  I've met some of these people in real life.  One of them was a direct related to an ex-girlfriend of mine, with an ID code tattooed on his arm.  These people were/are certainly real.  What was done to these innocent people was an incredible injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were many other minorities alongside the Jews who shared in this tragedy.  However, if you read Mein Kampf, the Jews were unique to Hitler as a dominant alien minority which Germany needed to rid itself of.  Other persecuted minorities were either viewed as simply inferior, non-loyal, or were POWs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Millions certainly perished in these camps.  Rampant diseases took a huge toll, and the prisoners lives must have been worthless to their captors.  The details of their deaths aside, countless German prisoners in WWII had been forcibly removed from their homes and put into caged areas by people who hated them, without any specific plans for their release or rehabilitation.  I'm positive that millions prisoners were killed.  The only arguable details involve the number killed, and how they were killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The historical details of Jewish extermination under the Nazis are very hard to decipher.  Some of the most damning details of the Holocaust which were accepted as historical fact are totally unverified.  The most noteworthy unverified historical fact is that Hitler commanded the systematic extermination of the Jews.  He definitely hated them, wanted them gone, and very plausibly could have ordered their extermination, but no first hand evidence of this has been produced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other big component of Holocaust Denial is the blind eye turned to other victims of similar circumstances.  Stalin conducted organized exterminations of populations on a greater scale than the Germans, yet the Jewish victims of German are made the focus, if not the sole subject, of the popular history of WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more to say, but I don't want to write a novel.

       It's easy to fabricate things like Wannsee and Operation Reinhard after everyone's dead and/or spent time being tortured half to death in Soviet custody.  In case you missed it, Hitler was very consumed with fighting a multi-front world war (and winning) against England, France &amp; Russia until America got suckered into the fight.  People always act like eradicating Jews was Hitler's numero uno goal in life, but it wasn't.  I can assure you it was probably 5th or 6th on his list of importance.  And if all he wanted to do was kill Jews than why go through all the trouble of loading them onto trains and transporting them to the camps?  Why not just give orders to shoot Jews on sight??  Wouldn't that be more practical?  It just doesn't add up, and it doesn't make any sense what the history books say about this.  And the reason why it doesn't make sense is because the "winners" got to tell the story of how everything went down and the Germans have been so thoroughly shamed they'll never have the courage to try and correct anything.

       It's not possible to fake that level of complexity. We're talking documents, firsthand accounts, hard evidence of the plans, and more. The Soviets could not possibly have managed to fake something of this scale.

       Like that somehow means it was no big deal that the Holocaust happened? It doesn't matter how high it ranked, it still ranked, and that's the issue.

       I guess I don't know what you're trying to accomplish here.  I think we can agree the Soviets were hands down a much more brutal regime who killed and tortured untold millions more in their gulags than the Germans ever did.

      <p>
       Except that a) The Soviet regime lasted a lot longer than the Nazis, b) when you account for this, the Nazis were far more brutal, and c) no one denies the Soviets were responsible for some brutal things like the purges and Holodomor. Also, d) the Japanese were just as bad as either the Soviets or the Nazis in terms of brutality (see:
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731">
        Unit 731
       </a>
       ). As for the thing on the gas chambers, a lot of their evidence hinges on the Leuchter report, which has a lot of holes. The documentaries also never account for the deaths having any other cause than gassing (though the majority where), such as the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen">

       They're all bad, but you'll never convince me the Nazis were worse than the Soviets during that same time period.  He who killed the most takes that crown.  And that man is Stalin because his regime killed far, far more people, tens of millions it was often claimed, in the endless wastes of the Gulag.

       Do you have a source for this? Because between the Holodomor and the purges, the death toll is only around 4.3 million (which is still not exactly tiny).

       Yeah, they deported some Jews to Palestine.  I didn't mean to imply that it is historical fact that Hitler specifically intended to exterminate the Jews.

       If you read Mein Kampf, Hitler definitely wanted them out of Germany, and for the millions of poor masses, that meant going to prison camps, not hamane relocation.

       Is there really any solid evidence behind the gas chambers? Many scholars, including Jewish ones, say no. Why would they incinerate bodies pumped full of explosive gas? Why would they spend so much on lethal gas when they could have just stopped food or water rations?

       Millions of people did die in concentration camps, however 6 million Jews? No. The number is closer to between 100-200 thousand. There were not even 6 millions Jewish persons living in Europe at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there an extermination of the Jewish population? Likely not. As you said, there is no evidence. Most of the Jewish lives lost were from the Allies bombing the railroads and halting the flow of food into the camps, thus causing the prisoners to starve to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this light, did the "holocaust" really happen? Being objective, not really, but it depends how you define it. Were a lot of innocent lives lost in a horrible set of events set in motion by an evil dictator? Absolutely. Were one group of people singled out on top of other groups? Yes. Was it awful? Yes.

       The gas was only explosive in very high concentrations, higher even than was needed to kill people with.

         Hearing about Holocaust denial compelled former SS-Rottenführer Oskar Gröning to publicly speak about what he witnessed at Auschwitz, and denounce Holocaust deniers,stating: "I would like you to believe me. I saw the gas chambers. I saw the crematoria. I saw the open fires. I was on the ramp when the selections took place. I would like you to believe that these atrocities happened because I was there."

       Can you explain where these are from? Because I found numbers that completely disagree with you, and they are by the same group as your 1938 photo.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Estimates of the world Jewish population have been assembled by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (except for
the United States and Canada) and are probably the most authentic
available at the present time.1
The figures reveal that the total
Jewish population of the world has decreased by one-third, from
about 16,600,000 in 1939 to about 11,000,000 in 1946, as a result
of the annihilation by the Nazis of more than five and a half million
European Jews.
In Europe only an estimated 3,642,000 remain of the total Jewish
pre-war population of approximately 9,740,000.

       Maybe because your source is, get this, the American Jewish Archives (ha! great source there) which has no choice but to pump out any numbers it can think of to support the ludicrious 6,000,000(TM) figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think for a second: If one of the American Jewish Council's employees says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Actually boss, if we use real, independent data then there is no way we can support our 6,000,000 claim"

      <p>
       what would happen then, to that employee?

       You would have to provide an independent source, like I did, before I will treat it as worthy of replying to directly - before I respond to the substance of your claim (if you could still make the claim then).

       As the Soviets and Chinese Communists discovered, the most efficient way to kill large numbers of human beings is a single pistol round to the back of the head. That is what the Nazis probably would have used
       <em>
        if they had ever intended to exterminate the Jews
       </em>
       . But they did not use it, because there was no such extermination policy.

        In a letter dated 2 July 1941 Heydrich communicated to his SS and Police Leaders that the Einsatzgruppen were to execute all senior and middle ranking Comintern officials; all senior and middle ranking members of the central, provincial, and district committees of the Communist Party; extremist and radical Communist Party members; people's commissars; and Jews in party and government posts. Open-ended instructions were given to execute "other radical elements (saboteurs, propagandists, snipers, assassins, agitators, etc.)." He instructed that any pogroms spontaneously initiated by the occupants of the conquered territories were to be quietly encouraged. On 8 July, he announced that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans, and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot. On 17 July Heydrich ordered that the Einsatzgruppen were to kill all Jewish Red Army prisoners of war, plus all Red Army prisoners of war from Georgia and Central Asia, as they too might be Jews.

       Evil dictator? It seems to me that the two factors that primarily contribute to Adolf Hitler's supposed evilness are the The Holocaust™ and the supposed instigation of WWII. As you have established the dubiousness of the former claim, allow me to dispute the latter:
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1917 the
       <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;es_th=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=jews+and+bolshevik+revolution">
        Jews overthrew the Russian Empire
       </a>
       and created the USSR, beginning one of the
       <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Red_Holocaust">
        bloodiest two decades in world history
       </a>
       . Millions upon millions were murdered by the Bolshevik regime. The communists sought to dig their claws into all of Europe after their success in Russia, and in particular in Germany. The NSDAP was always a staunch opponent to Judeo-Bolshevism, and this view was shared by literally all the oppressed peoples of the Soviet Union (see
       <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBydokomuna">
        zydokomuna
       </a>
       , from Polska). Because Jews overwhelmingly supported the ideas of Marxism, especially as one traveled further east, the National Socialists initiated laws that limited the ability of Jews to manipulate public life. In the 1930s after Hitler's election the Jewish community worldwide organized
       <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;es_th=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=judea%20declares%20war%20on%20germany">
        a boycott of all German goods
       </a>
       . Now, being boycotted by less than 1% of the population doesn't seem to be too bad, but when that 1% controls a disproportionate amount of world business and production, it can be quite devastating.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, on to appeasement; the Germans annexed Austria and the Sudetenland, and the Munich Agreement was signed wherein Britain would allow Germany to keep it's Sudeten territories, as long as Germany pursued no policy of expansionism. Chamberlain was being hopelessly naive; the pursuit of a Greater Germany would not stop with the Sudeten Germans. Next up, the Germans living in the territory granted to the Poles following the humiliating, devastating Treaty of Versailles.
       <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Danzig#1920_-_1939">
        The city of Danzig
       </a>
       in particular was the object of German ambitions. Ethnic Germans living in the east were being subjected to terrible abuses, as the Poles believed that with Britain and France by their side, they could poke and prod the Germans. After all, the Munich Agreement prevented the Germans from retaliating in any way!
      </p>
      <p>
       Germany would not be so weak and indolent. They invaded Poland and reduced Polish territory to the region surrounding Warsaw, Krakow, and Lwow. But the "Allies" would not sit back and watch.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Polish_military_alliance">
        The British and French had both signed defensive pacts with Poland
       </a>
       , and Poland thought that even if Germany broke the Munchen Agreement and invaded, they would be aided by the British and French. Now, obviously not all Poles were so short-sighted and arrogant. But the power of those forces who wished to destroy Germany (namely, plutocratic western and Communist eastern Jews, and their goyim subjects), is difficult to overestimate in the late 1930s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the British and French help the Poles maintain their independence as the treaty stipulated? NO, and this is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_betrayal">
        one of the greatest betrayals of the modern age
       </a>
       . They allowed the Germans and the Soviets and carve up Poland's dying body, and the
       <strong>
        sole purpose of the defensive pact was to drag the British and French into a war, with the intent of destroying Germany
       </strong>
       . We can see a similar scenario in the American entry in the war; they exploited Japan and Germany's defensive pact, and provoked the Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor, in order to crush Hitler in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>

       Where are all the mass graves? If you are implying that those who supposedly were gassed in camps were instead summarily executed by the mobile-task-force, then there would be a substantial quantity of non-cremated bodies in mass graves throughout eastern Europe. What examples can you give me aside from Kathyn (done by USSR) and Babi Yar?

       The people murdered by these death squads, would be registered and processed before they were killed. There exist substantial records inside the Nazi archives of their own industrial level extermination operations. In terms of Graves there are vast and numerous sites punctuating the path of the einsatzgruppen, winding through Poland as they killed their way across eastern Europe into Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the largest Graves is located in Vilnius, Lithuania in an unfinished Soviet fuel storage site. the einsatzgruppen followed behind the Wehrmacht to clean up civilian undesirables, but their mission was to enact the final solution. At first the death squads encouraged the local population to murder the Jewish community amongst themselves, which occurred sporadically, eg in the death dealer of Kovno incident, but shortly thereafter the einsatzgruppen directed the mass killings independently for efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in terms of substantiation, the Nazis documented their own crimes. There is a vast historical record also of the attempted cover up once the war appeared lost. Either way, the truth isn't difficult to ascertain if you are interested. It's up to you to study the available records, which I assure you are thorough.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good start, if you're interested is the destruction of the European Jews by Hilberg.

        The operation also returned to the scenes of earlier mass killings such as Babi Yar, Ponary, the Ninth Fort, as well as Bronna Góra. By 1944, with Soviet armies advancing, SS-Obergruppenführer Wilhelm Koppe, head of the Reichsgau Wartheland ordered that each of the five districts of General Government territory set up its own Aktion 1005 commando to begin "cleaning" mass graves. The operations were not entirely successful as the advancing Soviet troops reached some of the sites before they could be cleared.

        The problem is that these images need to be placed in context by further information or evidence, because on their own they don't substantiate the total of 2 million non-combat Jewish civilians killed by the EG.

       I can totally agree that we should also talk about the other groups killed, such as Gypsies, Homosexuals, Freemasions, Jehovas Witnesses, Soviet POW's, and the disabled. But that doesn't mean the the Holocaust was any less of a tragedy than it was (in fact, it would be even worse, since the total death toll of all the groups was 12 million)

       The 16.5 million figure accounts for all the engineered famines that took place from 1917 until WWII. A great sin of Western historiography is to view the Holodomor as a singular event in 1933, and that aside from that year, things were fine for Christians in the USSR. This is patently false.

        this

       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Russia">
        this one

       You might be right.  I'm not super hardcore about my beliefs on the Holocaust.  My main point is that the history of the era is tainted by propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding my statement about Hitler commanding the systematic extermination of the Jews, I meant what I said very literally.  Perhaps a bunch of high-level Nazi officials oversaw the mass murder of Jews, but I haven't seen anything to suggest that Hitler himself commanded or had specific knowledge of the Jewish death factories we are taught about in history class.  This isn't to say that Hitler wasn't responsible for the Nazi activities, but its grounds for questioning that Hitler's personal agenda included the mass murder of Jews.

        <p>
         In 1922 Hitler told Major Josef Hell (a journalist at the time): Once I really am in power, my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews. As soon as I have the power to do so, I will have gallows built in rows—at the Marienplatz in Munich, for example—as many as traffic allows. Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         On 21 January 1939 Hitler spoke with František Chvalkovský and said: We are going to destroy the Jews. They are not going to get away with what they did on 9 November 1918. The day of reckoning has come.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         On 30 January at the Sports Palace in Berlin, Hitler told the crowd: And we say that the war will not end as the Jews imagine it will, namely with the uprooting of the Aryans, but the result of this war will be the complete annihilation of the Jews.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In Mein Kampf, Hitler argued that a war against Jews would have saved Germany from losing World War I: If at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas, as happened to hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers in the field, the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.

         In the following widely cited speech made on January 30, 1939, Hitler says to the Reichstag: Today I want to be a prophet once more: if international Jewish financiers inside and outside Europe again succeed in plunging the nations into a world war, the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth and with it the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Note: Hitler's choice of language in German in the final sentence of the above passage is "die Vernichtung der jüdischen Rasse in Europa" - unambiguously meaning "the extermination [or annihilation] of the Jewish race in Europe."
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         In his personal diary, Joseph Goebbels writes: "February 14, 1942: The Führer once again expressed his determination to clean up the Jews in Europe pitilessly. There must be no squeamish sentimentalism about it. The Jews have deserved the catastrophe that has now overtaken them. Their destruction will go hand in hand with the destruction of our enemies. We must hasten this process with cold ruthlessness.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When questioned by interrogators if orders for the extermination of Jews were delegated in writing by Himmler, Adolf Eichmann states: I never saw a written order, Herr Hauptmann. All I know is that Heydrich said to me: "The Führer has ordered the physical extermination of the Jews." He said that as clearly and surely as I'm repeating it now.

       Some of these are taken from the diaries of people who heard this firsthand, and would also have no reason to randomly implicate Hitler, since they were private diaries. As for all the others, I'd guess that yes, since they were all from public speeches, or to people who then gave firsthand accounts.

       You write not a single word about why the Germans did this. You do not even consider that it may have been justified, due to the power Jews held in German society at the time, and their abuse of that power.

      <p>
       On the contrary, it is obvious that the Germans went to great lengths to preserve the lives of the people in concentration camps. What do you think the gassing of clothing, or the shaving of heads, was all about? It was an effort to cut down on disease, which the Jews brought themselves into the camps, so that more people would live.

      <p>
       Wrong! There are innumerable details of the Holocaust mythology that must be questioned, and that on the face of it are absurd. The very idea that the Germans ever intended to exterminate Jews is not at all proven by any real evidence that exist, as you yourself point out.

       I can't see why the Nazis would have had compassion for the innocent Jews that they imprisoned.  What plan could have possibly had for them besides letting them die?

       If you value someone's life, why would you wrongfully imprisoning them indefinitely.  Besides eventual death or enslavement, I can't imagine what plans the Nazis might have had for their racial/political prisoners.

       Ask yourself, what was the purpose of concentration camps in the United States during WW2? There's your answer. The Germans had concentration camps for the same reason the Americans had concentration camps -- to
       <em>
        concentrate
       </em>
       the people who were considered dangerous and needed to be watched. During the War, the Germans also used those in the camps for slave labor. America, with its vast resources, wealth and mass production lines, never needed slave labor, so none was used. America was never even seriously stressed during the War, but it is telling that they, too, had concentration camps, just like the Germans.

       That plan may have been outlined, but it seems like very wishful thinking to assume that Hitler actually intended to peaceably relocate all the Jewish prisoners to Madagascar.  The only examples of forced relocations that I can think of are still generally considered as genocidal events, a la "The Trails of Tears" for the Native Americans.

       There's a lot more you could say. As regards Hitlers motivation and jewish motivation. It's something which has to be addressed, was he was a maniac or a prophet? No country in the world would  voluntary allowed themselves to be conquered. I feel you we're a little disingenous  when you omitted the jews sins when it came to the 2nd world war. Seriously? No mention of the jewish controlled Russia, or the jewish lead communist party in Germany. Let's not talk about the jewish boycott of German goods.

       Ahhhh I saw the excepts from that in The Greatest Truth Never Told.  My impression is that it is a legitimate piece of investigative journalism, but even if we assume that what the film shows is totally valid, it doesn't single-handedly disprove that prisoners were mass-murdered there--though it strongly suggests that the place was dress up to conform with a false narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard a piece of corroborating evidence in some lecture give by David Irving.  According to Irving, who has as much integrity as a historian as anyone else in my opinion, in official transcript or recording, when Hitler was told "The Soviets have taken Auschwitz," Hitler was totally undisturbed, and just proceeded to discuss other matters without giving the capture of Auschwitz a second thought.  This implies that Hitler did not himself think that Auschwitz was of any particular significance, which contradicts the popularized Holocaust history.

      <p>
       No, I'm aware of the Rudolf report. It makes the identical errors as the Leuchter report, and also has a pretty clear bias towards Holocaust denial, in how his experiments were carried out.

       What does this have to do with the actual contents of the report? Not to mention the Germany has (understandably) harsh laws against Holocaust denial, so this is hardly unexpected.

      <p>
       When you say this, are you just accounting for anything said at Nuremberg, or also later on, because there were quite a few confessions. Also, they were very accurate, and could easily be corroborated by other independent confessions.

       And even despite this, what he said can be corroborated with multiple non-tortured accounts that agree entirely, such as the diaries of Pery Broad, an SS man stationed at Auschwitz while Höss was the commandant and the diary kept by SS physician at Auschwitz Johann Kremer, as well as the testimony of hundreds of camp guards and victims.

       <li>
        SS-Oberscharführer Josef Klehr has said that anyone who maintains that nobody was gassed at Auschwitz must be "crazy or on the wrong". SS-Unterscharführer Oswald Kaduk has stated that he does not consider those who maintain such a thing as normal people. Hearing about Holocaust denial compelled former SS-Rottenführer Oskar Gröning to publicly speak about what he witnessed at Auschwitz, and denounce Holocaust deniers, stating: I would like you to believe me. I saw the gas chambers. I saw the crematoria. I saw the open fires. I was on the ramp when the selections took place. I would like you to believe that these atrocities happened because I was there.

      <p>
       First off, I find the trial of Leuchter very ... odd. The first thing that the judge does is condemn Leuchter for his "lack of qualification" to be presenting such evidence. The very first movement of the trial is blatant character assassination before any shred of evidence is even considered.
      </p>
      <p>
       That alone, to me, reeks of corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, you do mention that "holocaust denial" is illegal in several countries. Have you stopped to think about that? This is the only historical event, the "belief" in which is enforced by law and cannot, by law, be questioned. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is holocaust revisionism some kind of inquisition? You don't see moon landing conspiracy theorists, pushers of homeopathy, or other nut bags with crazy ideas being dragged before magistrates. The blatant pursuit and persecution of holocaust heretics alone lends credence to the fact that there is a powerful interest in keeping the official story intact in public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth doesn't need to be upheld at the end of a sword.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact remains that there is very little in terms of physical evidence that the gas chambers existed. The wiki page you linked mentions a few documents related to train schedules and some sparse reports of the numbers of people sent to the camps. No one denies that a lot of people were interred in the camps, but there is not a shred of any document which mentions mass extermination or gas chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The claim that most of the gassing chambers were demolished before the Allies liberated the camps is rather.... convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, all of the things you've cited do not answer the bulk of the outstanding questions brought up by Cole's investigation alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such as, why were fake holes built into the Auschwitz chamber
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the war, and why are they being shown to the public falsely as the portals through which gas was thrown? Piper himself admitted that this was not true and yet they were willfully feeding tourists false information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the fake chimneys? Again, it appears as though someone set up these "props" to make the place seem more menacing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The swimming pool? You realize there are conflicting witness reports about Auschwitz, many claim that there was a theater and the swimming pool was for use by the inmates. Why would the SS build a pool just for propaganda? That sounds like a convenient denial, and just makes no damn sense, especially being that it is never shown to anyone who tours the facility. Most people have no clue that it even exists. Propaganda my ass!
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, you have also failed to mention several key events leading up to the war. Firstly, the Jewish declaration of war on Germany in 1933. This is in conflict with information found on the wiki page for Operation Reinhard, which claims that death camps were already in operation as early as 1933.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that Hitler was not even at the height of his power in 33, he didn't even have total control over the military at that time has he had only recently become Chancellor. How could he have organized the round up and extermination of that many people in such a short amount of time?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_boycott_of_German_goods">
        this
       </a>
       page the first German act against Jews was
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "The Nazi regime protested internationally and on April 1, 1933, organized a (one day) boycott of Jewish businesses in Germany,[2] which was the first of official anti-Jewish acts by the German government."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       and of course was a purely reactionary course of action against what was seen as Jewish aggression.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the Jews who drew first blood on Germany, not the other way around, as our history lessons had us believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have also failed to mention anything concerning the resulting
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement">
        Haavara Agreement
       </a>
       , which again, conflicts with the mythology of a murderous Hitler. It is no secret that Hitler did not particularly like the Jewish people, and that he wanted them out of Germany. His solution was to strike a peace accord with the Zionists, and facilitate the peaceful transfer of Jews to Palestine with all of their wealth and personal possessions in-tact. It was an agreement that continued until the war made the transfers impossible. This was, in fact, the beginning of the state of Israel, a fact also not taught as part of the "hitler bad" discourse of WWII history.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as eyewitness testimony, there is a lot of controversy due to the fact that there are so many conflicting accounts. Some witnesses still claim there were gassings at camps which historians have concluded that no such thing occurred. I have serious doubts about SS witnesses, given that so many hundreds of thousands of their former brothers in arms were hanged, starved to death in POW camps after the war, hauled off to gulags, or hunted down by the Mossad. It makes too much sense that they'd say anything to appear remorseful in the face of the propaganda onslaught that was occurring after the war. I don't personally trust it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take away all of the emotional circumstantial narratives, and stick to things that are empirically verifiable, you find that there is really very little that holds water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a page with some information about the false evidence of German atrocity presented at Nuremberg.

       Important clarification; do we know anything about the people giving said testimonies, aside from them being holocaust survivors? It seems far more likely that there is some other reason (i.e. false memories), especially considering the overwhelming opinion by both other inmates and former Nazis (even reports written at the time). Also, you do know that the swimming pool and all that was literally made so it could be
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresienstadt_(film">

       ), right? You can even find the video if you look around. Also, how is this somehow unbelievable? The express purpose of the video was to hide the fact that they were actively and brutally murdering people from the general public (and also from people who would be sent there later).

        a short Jewish boycott of German goods
       </a>
       , due to the pretty blatantly anti-semetic laws and practices in place at the time (for reference, the Dachau concentration camp was opened four days earlier). The Nazis saw this as an act of aggression, which was why the Daily Express (which surprise! was a tabloid) sensationalized the title to claim Judea declared war. That's also why you never see the article, just the headline.

       First of all, because he had enough power pretty much as soon as the Reichstag fire happened, since he used it as a way to enact laws that essentially removed many civil liberties from the German population. Also, it doesn't take 10 years to build a single concentration camp.

       Yeah, so why don't we stop all of this semantic back-and-forth, and you can just list for all of us all of the factual empirical evidence that 6 million jews were exterminated in gas chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       That excludes anything circumstantial, including witness statements.

       Oh, and speaking of bias, you dismiss the article about the lampshade and soap simply on the basis of what site it's on? How about judge the content of the article. Most of it is taken from the written record from the Neuremberg archives.

       If you looked at what I wrote, you'd see that on top of the issue of bias (which wasn't even the main issue I had with it), there are actually some serious flaws in the article; notably that they took a single sentence of a single testimony and claimed it was something constantly brought up and repeatedly claimed.

       I showed you the link to the lampshade and soap article because you mentioned that you had never heard of them, and it's important to note that it was presented as evidence of Nazi atrocity at the post war trial and did, in fact, if you bother to look into the issue yourself, persist as a myth for many years even after it was proven to be a fabrication.

       I gave hard evidence already, in the form of documents, firsthand accounts in journals, photos, remains (both human and structural) and other things. There is already no shortage of evidence,

      <p>
       First of all, most testimonies are actually not as conflicting as you seem to think. Granted, some are probably wrong, but we're talking a vast minority. As for the commonly accepted version of events, not only do we have both sides with agreeing testimonies (including, might I add, a large number of Nazis who were
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       tortured), but we also have documents, photos and other hard evidence that is in complete agreement with said version of events.

       Which proves? When I say commonly accepted, I'm not referring to urban legends. I'm referring to actual historians who agree that this was a thing that happened, which so far is not what I've found.

       Did you even read what I wrote? Are photos now not a legitimate source? What about the many, many other documents than just "train schedules". What about the Einsatzgruppen? What about

       It's almost as if... you are required to prove your argument! Again, since you seem so hard set on this claim, I ask again what evidence there is that the Holocaust never happened. In the same way that if you claim the moon landing never happened, you need proof of your claim, the same thing goes for Holocaust denial.

      <p>
       Yes. I'm asking you to show me something that would prove the Holocaust did not happen. I'm asking you to show me the evidence that lead to your conclusion in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the only evidence you have for this is articles which mention both Jews and the number 6 million, which are taken out of context? In fact, let's look closer at these articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Article 1
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact, the actual Jewish population of the Russian empire at the time was
       <a href="http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1906_1907_5_Statistics.pdf#page=3">
        5,215,805
       </a>
       . So it's not especially out there for such a number to be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Article 2
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It actually explains how they reached this number in the article itself
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "From reports from representatives abroad it is estimated that of the 9,000,000 to 12,000,000 souls making up the Jewish population of the world, exclusive of the 3,000,000 Jews in the United States, a quarter of the number are destitute, starving, and homeless, and a full half will need assistance to become self-supporting again."
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So again, they aren't just pulling this number out of thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Article 3
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "which has deprived more than 6,000,000 Jews
        <strong>
         and non-Aryans
        </strong>
        of their birthright"
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So they didn't even specify 6 million Jews in this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Article 4
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is perhaps the only article that could be argued, however it really does look like nothing more than a well calculated estimate. On top of this, this is a single article that talks about 6,000,000 Jews in terms of casualties of the Holocaust, and if over the course of 40 years, this is all there is, then it's not exactly proof that this was all agreed upon by Jews.

      <p>
       First of all, you say that like it somehow proves the Holocaust didn't happen. Secondly, I really hope your evidence for this is more than just headlines.

       Fun fact, that's an outright lie. The actual number given is 11,266,600. Also, if you read the actual pages, you'd see that at the top it outright admits that the figures from 1939-48 were from 1939 estimates. So in other words,
       <em>
        the reason the numbers don't change is that the data didn't change either.

       Turns out, you're not wholly wrong, but there is more to this disparity than mentioned before.
      </p>
      <p>
       The estimate you are referring to is on page 204, it was provided by the American Jewish Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
       The estimate referred to earlier is from the World Almanac association itself. The fact that it coincides with the Council of Church's estimate is telling...
      </p>
      <p>
       There is already a writeup of this issue:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The World Almanac series of books sometimes provided two sets of figures for the world Jewish population. One came from the AJC (American Jewish Committee), and the other is the World Almanac's own estimation.
      </p>

1950 : n/a (AJC); n/a (Almanac)
</code></pre>
      <p>
       In 1949, the AJC didn't provide an estimation for that year, instead, they revised the number of Jews for 1939 and 1947:
      </p>
      <pre><code>1949 AJC revision for 1939 : 16,643,120, page 204
1949 AJC revision for 1947 : 11,266,600, page 204
</code></pre>
      <p>
       After 1949, the World Almanac discontinued providing their own estimations, instead, they only reported the numbers given by AJC. In 1950, the AJC didn't provide an estimation for that year, instead, they revised the number of Jews for 1948:
      </p>
      <pre><code>1950 AJC revision for 1948 : 11,373,000, page 473
</code></pre>
      <p>
       So, let's brief this quickly. The last available pre-war number comes from 1938. In 1940, they somehow got a new estimation. In 1941, they use the 1938 number, not the 1940 number. In 1942, they got a new estimation, which was then used in both the 1943 and 1944 versions, until the war ended and they made a new estimation for 1945, which was then used for 1946, 1947 and 1948. In 1949, the Almanac made an estimation of their own, whereas the AJC decided to revise the 1947 number instead.
      </p>
      <pre><code>15,688,259 - 11,266,600 = 4,421,659
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Hmm, 4.4 million missing Jews. No, that can't be right. We all knew 6 million died before the Nuremberg Trials began anyway. So what to do? Well, the AJC had a great idea! They revised the 1939 number by adding 1 million Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       895,029 to be precise. So:
      </p>
      <pre><code>4,421,659 + 895,029 = 5,316,688
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Bingo. The official Holocaust story goes that somewhere from 5.4 to 6 million Jews died. The number was predetermined and the AJC played along. Somehow they knew, 10 years later in 1949, that the 1938 and 1939 numbers were wrong. No mention of their source, no mention of their methodology used. They just changed the number. Poof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historians will tell you the added one million Jews comes from the Wannsee Conference, where the Nazis counted 11,000,000 Jews in Europe, but it is known that this number was exaggerated by roughly two million, therefore their point is moot. The additional one million are imaginary Jews, added for the sole purpose of having more Jews killed on paper. This is one of the essential bits of the lie that six million Jews died, but as we can, it couldn't possibly be six million, but 4.4 million maximum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this doesn't mean 4.4 million Jews died, because they didn't, it's just that most Jews after the war spread all over the world, took gentile names and became crypto-Jews. What's more, the AJC stopped reporting the actual number of Jews for current years, instead, they reported for two years back. Starting with 1949 when they "revised" the 1947 number, then in 1950 when they "revised" the 1948 number. They just kept "revising" the number of Jews two years back, ignoring the actual numbers. I wonder why?

      <p>
       So your argument is that it's within a million of 6 million, so it must be exactly 6 million? Also, even if we have the 4 million number, how could you possibly account for even that many deaths without gas chambers and the Einsatzgruppen? Finally, just because they revise an estimate does not magically mean that it's all a conspiracy. Numbers change, and information surfaces, which is likely what happened. Don't ask me what happened, but there are no shortage of possible reasons (i.e. didn't account for non-religious Jews).

       Probably because they were fixing any errors. It seems like you're just grasping at straws here ("They changed the number at one point! It must be a conspiracy"). If this is what your theory is based on, then you failed to account for the fact that statistics can change due to data. For example, incomplete data will give you a number that is completely off.

       <li>
        Markiewicz and his team used microdiffusion techniques to test for cyanide in samples from the suspected gas chambers, from delousing chambers, and from control areas elsewhere within Auschwitz. The control samples tested negative, while cyanide residue was found in high concentrations in the delousing chambers, and lower concentrations in the homicidal gas chambers. This is consistent with the amounts required to kill lice and humans.

       I find it interesting that despite this alleged report not being made public, deniers somehow got their hands on a copy that is of such shitty resolution, it's not even funny. Frankly, the fact that all of two sites (of which both are Holocaust denial) on the entirety of the web seem to know this makes me skeptical of exactly how legitimate this document is (especially considering how easy it would be to fake that first page, which is also the only page they show)

        You realize the arguments about different amounts of cyanide being explained by different amounts necessary to kill lice and humans is utterly retarded?

      <p>
       Are you saying that every organism is equally susceptible to everything? Because that's even more retarded. The concentrations needed to kill lice are different than that for humans, it's pretty simple.

       I read the documents, I just find that the title page seems like it was hastily typed on a typewriter, followed by a pretty much illegible stamp that's claimed to be from the Auschwitz museum, seems kinda sketchy. On top of this, the fact that there are only two sites that even acknowledge it's existence, doesn't exactly help.

       His video convinced me the holocaust is a holohoax. There's too many holes for me to give the traditionalist story any credit. Not somewhere I wanted to go, but facts are facts. It's a myth and a scam that jews have played like a fiddle for their own financial and political benefit.

       The 16.5 million figure accounts for all the engineered famines that took place from 1917 until WWII. A great sin of Western historiography is to view the Holodomor as a singular event in 1933, and that aside from that year, things were fine for Christians in the USSR. This is patently false.

       Your infatuation with the myth of 6 million means that my efforts are wasted on you. Hopefully some day you will realize that not even Jews believe that figure; they acknowledge it as symbolic, and as a continuation of the

        The operation also returned to the scenes of earlier mass killings such as Babi Yar, Ponary, the Ninth Fort, as well as Bronna Góra. By 1944, with Soviet armies advancing, SS-Obergruppenführer Wilhelm Koppe, head of the Reichsgau Wartheland ordered that each of the five districts of General Government territory set up its own Aktion 1005 commando to begin "cleaning" mass graves. The operations were not entirely successful as the advancing Soviet troops reached some of the sites before they could be cleared.

       Would you accept the photos I gave of Sonderaktion 1005 in my other response to you? If not I can use something else.

       No Im not saying I don't accept your explanations. I mean that we could go on with interpretations forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would just like to reduce the discussion to hard empirical evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for witness testimony, there are too many conflicting accounts, and like I mentioned many German confessions were extracted by torture and intimidation. All in all, I don't consider it wholly reliable. If you can't do much better than that, then a doubter such as myself could conclude that it's all just hear-say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I showed you the link to the lampshade and soap article because you mentioned that you had never heard of them, and it's important to note that it was presented as evidence of Nazi atrocity at the post war trial and did, in fact, if you bother to look into the issue yourself, persist as a myth for many years even after it was proven to be a fabrication.

      <p>
       Yes. I'm asking you to show me something that would prove the Holocaust did not happen. I'm asking you to show me the evidence that lead to your conclusion in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the only evidence you have for this is articles which mention both Jews and the number 6 million, which are taken out of context? In fact, let's look closer at these articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Article 1
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact, the actual Jewish population of the Russian empire at the time was
       <a href="http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1906_1907_5_Statistics.pdf#page=3">
        5,215,805
       </a>
       . So it's not especially out there for such a number to be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Article 2
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It actually explains how they reached this number in the article itself
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "From reports from representatives abroad it is estimated that of the 9,000,000 to 12,000,000 souls making up the Jewish population of the world, exclusive of the 3,000,000 Jews in the United States, a quarter of the number are destitute, starving, and homeless, and a full half will need assistance to become self-supporting again."
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So again, they aren't just pulling this number out of thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Article 3
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "which has deprived more than 6,000,000 Jews
        <strong>
         and non-Aryans
        </strong>
        of their birthright"
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So they didn't even specify 6 million Jews in this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Article 4
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is perhaps the only article that could be argued, however it really does look like nothing more than a well calculated estimate. On top of this, this is a single article that talks about 6,000,000 Jews in terms of casualties of the Holocaust, and if over the course of 40 years, this is all there is, then it's not exactly proof that this was all agreed upon by Jews.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As far as I'm concerned, all I see is one giant sympathy driven money machine.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       First of all, you say that like it somehow proves the Holocaust didn't happen. Secondly, I really hope your evidence for this is more than just headlines.
