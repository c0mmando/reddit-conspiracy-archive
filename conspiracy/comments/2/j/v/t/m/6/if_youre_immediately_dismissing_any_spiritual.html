        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve seen it time &amp; time again here, any mention of religion, spirituality, the supernatural, etc, and <em>instant</em> knee-jerk reactions of &quot;programming&quot;, &quot;control&quot;, &quot;idiocy&quot;. </p>

<p>The human condition IS SPIRITUAL. We are not just brains, but minds, not just hearts, but souls. This eternal battle of good vs evil, light vs dark, the elite vs the masses, it is the real crux of our current environment. Religion has been removed from our society, government, media, for an expressed purpose. Religious zealotry is pushed by the media, to be advertised as repressive, when in actuality, the message of all world religions are the same: detachment &amp; love. </p>

<p>Jesus, Buddha said the same thing: you are not your khakis... The Gods that rule our planet are Greed, Selfishness, Ego, Lust, Impatience. <em>I want what I want, and I want it now.</em></p>

<p>Keeping the masses divided, distrustful of any and all authority, pessimistic and fearful of loss or uncomfortability is the end goal. You&#39;re easier to manipulate when you&#39;re scared. </p>

<p>All these wars, throughout history; secret societies; symbolic words, dates &amp; locations; the actual imagery; all of it is very specific and intentional. It&#39;s not just about money, power, control; it&#39;s about souls. It&#39;s about energy. If you do not fear death, you possess greater power than the cabal.</p>

<p>Read sacred literature, there&#39;s more alike than differing. There&#39;s an encoded warning, set in the context of the culture at the time, eluding to the same struggle. The Bible isn&#39;t some oppressive mandate, it&#39;s a historical record and rebellion manual. Meditation techniques; dietary, clothing and housing advice;ways to settle disputes; all spiritual literature is pointing to the same goal, serve a Higher Power, by serving others, by detaching from your colonists, by detaching from your <em>things</em>, <em>by detaching from your fear</em>! </p>

<p>Many here process an insane amount of media, via the internet. Unplug for a week. Stop watching YouTube and the media, even w your skepticism. Try picking up a book, journaling, sitting in silence, walking in nature, <em>gasp</em> attending a spiritual service. Try stepping away from the incessant need to <em>know</em> &amp; move into the space of <em>being present NOW</em>. Because when SHTF, it&#39;s not going to be helpful to have stockpiled food, weapons or information; it&#39;s going to be about trusting your core instinct, knowing your soul and fearing not your own fate. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not inviting a debate here, I&#39;m asking you to pause for a moment and consider your resentment towards religion. Who does it serve? Does it make you feel more content? More connected to your neighbors, to the whole of humanity? Is the sum value of history less than or greater than your current need to feel &quot;right&quot;? Do you dismiss morality for intellectual debate? Do you dismiss religious debate, because you reject the misplaced assumption that you&#39;re being judged, rather than encouraged to fully seek the depths of human emotions and experiences?</p>

<p>Culture in general has been used as a tool of control for thousands of years. The very allegory of material existence is itself a tool of control. it goes without saying. Dismissing books like the bible because of the Catholic bureaucracy is a mistake. Even if the bible itself has been completely misrepresented with intent, one can read it with that in mind.</p>

<p>Specifically the words attributed to Jesus are completely misrepresented by those who wish to use them as a tool of control and those that attack those that use them as a tool of control. Forget the both of them. </p>

<p>It is ironic how <em>un</em>Christian the Vatican is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you have a true discussion about Christianity without acknowledging any the history of the church/corporation that speaks in its name?  That seems shortsighted.  Also, I think you&#39;re incorrect about &quot;most humans&quot; being aware of the extent of the control that exists and has existed for thousands of years.  Many are not, and this includes a lot of those who identify as religious as well as many on this sub.</p>

<p>I think a lot of Christians would be surprised if they read about the actions throughout the centuries of the Vatican, the Knights Templar, the Society of Jesus, etc.</p>

<p>I agree with that.. but what makes up the vast majority of the profound and simple truth expressed is MORE often overlooked than the failure of a church or corporation to hide it. People hide it from themselves as a final point of acceptance. I&#39;m guilty of it myself.. Sitting here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. The big subjective conspiracy is my own ego, a substance-less nothing, is keeping &quot;me&quot; from directly experiencing Truth itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is important to know architectural history. The great monuments to American Presidents are built in the tradition of Greek and Roman temples, and most churches today are usually built along the tradition of Roman courthouses.</p>

<p>Strange to most Americans is the continuity from Rome to Byzantine and then Islamic rule. Mehmed II, conqueror of Constantinople, declared himself Emperor of Rome and Caesar, and was the son of a Roman mother with imperial descent, and had a fair claim. One can see clearly that many great and wonderful Mosques are built along the same design as the Hagia Sophia, one of the greatest churches in Christian history.</p>

<p>While Europe was in a &quot;dark ages&quot; and suffered centuries of declining population and literary, economic, and scientific production, this never happened in the Islamic world which maintained its continuity and built on Roman achievements, albeit under the control of a new religion and military elite.</p>

<p>In all perfect honesty, and not skewing the facts at all, Islamic theocracy and architecture bears more continuity and relation to the late Christianized Eastern Roman Empire, whereas Americans can only evoke a relation through poor imitation. America&#39;s republican system bears little if any resemblance to that of ancient Rome or Greece, and actually has its roots in the Norse &#39;Thing&#39; as synthesized with English (Germanic) monarchy. It&#39;s no wonder that America wants to evoke images of Rome and the way it is remembered in European history, because it&#39;s always known for its vast power.</p>

<p>Christianity as a whole is being exploited &amp; actively monetized by countless false prophets. They want tithes and tribute, rather than real change. God deserves the glory, not the people of this earth - whose life can be taken away at any second.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a major in comparative religion, so my rejection of religion is hardly knee-jerk. I&#39;ve studied religions large and small in great detail. Major religions were largely shaped by political forces looking to use them for control. That is a historical fact. Look up the Council of Nicea. The &quot;holy&quot; books of the three major western religions condone rape, murder, incest, genocide, slavery, the persecution of homosexuals, and the oppression of women in the name of their god. Eastern religions have their problems too, but I won&#39;t go into that at the moment as it isn&#39;t as relevant for most people reading this.  </p>

<p>Having said all of that, I am not closed to the possibility of a spiritual aspect of reality. I simply know from extensive research than any true spirituality which may have once existed in the world&#39;s major religions has been mostly buried by forces that most certainly do not desire liberation for the human condition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, it really boils down to learning what one&#39;s soul wants, and doing it. doing what really makes one happy, disregarding all of these social/cultural &#39;rules&#39; and norms that most of us live, unknowingly or knowingly, day to day. it really is about making constant happiness achievable. it&#39;s questioning beliefs, it&#39;s changing habitual behaviors that don&#39;t serve us, it&#39;s really becoming a skeptic when it comes to what society tell us as right or wrong. there&#39;s a big lesson that i learned myself, that more-or-less says there is no right or wrong, only experiences. this might be getting more into a <a href="/r/psychonaut">/r/psychonaut</a> style post, but it&#39;s entirely relate-able when it comes to questioning our governments, questioning our society, questioning everything. </p>

<p>you ever seen the bumper stickers that say &quot;question reality&quot;? why go on, day to day with society whispering into our ears and breathing down our backs. when it comes down to it, our lives are completely and utterly about ourselves. that must not be construed in an egotistical way. hope i&#39;ve given you some insight into the world of &quot;soul coaching&quot;. some consider it silly, far-fetched, even... i don&#39;t, as it&#39;s changed my life and continues to do so. become aware, it&#39;ll change ya. </p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t mean to say that there is no value from religious books.  Certainly understanding the multitudes of paths that you can follow is of value, but ultimately, if that path doesn&#39;t take you to the deepest realms of your own personal psyche to where the &quot;you&quot; connects to the divine, I feel that you&#39;re missing out.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here is my interpretation of what God is, and how we play a role.  God is the all-inclusive infinite.  We are not only a piece of that infinite, it is impossible to separate us from it.  This idea that we are somehow removed from the infinite has clouded our minds and judgement to forget all is of the same source.  </p>

<p>This is where the idea of freedom, freewill, and individualism comes into play.  In the scope of an infinite view there are seemingly two opposing forces, creation and destruction.  Or existence and non-existence.  Existence (creation) seeks expansion of all possibilities through the means of individual points, or identities.  Non-existence (destruction) seeks to collapse individual points down to a singularity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the old battle of &#39;good vs. evil&#39;.   </p>

<p>I&#39;d argue that buddhism prescribes <em>more</em> subjugation. It is a constant effort to tame the conceptual mind which is &quot;you&quot; for the majority of us. Is this not subjugating the sinner through different methods? With good old new testament JC you take him into your heart once and you&#39;re done with the whole thing. </p>

<p>In tibetan buddhism they perform all sorts of rituals for deities, protectors and local gods. In hinduism they accept their guru as a divine incarnation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The primary goal of buddhism is to relieve subjugation. There&#39;s no effort to tame made, that action would be a manifestation of your ego. It&#39;s about liberating your point of perspective/soul/true essence from the ideas that you have and what you think makes up &quot;you&quot;, while giving no judgement or distinction, other than that those things aren&#39;t really you. </p>

<p>Tibetan buddhism also teaches, in a tenuous way, that the gods are inside yourself, and that you must recognize their appearance as you. Like it&#39;s stated in the tibetan book of the dead, when the gods appear to the traveler, they must recognize the god&#39;s presence and radiance as their own to be liberated.</p>

<p>regarding the op. It&#39;s disingenuous to say that all religions teach to serve a higher power, because buddhism does not. And I don&#39;t see christianity teaching people to how to detach from their sense of self. Detaching from material items is taught, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily go much further than that.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t so much &quot;reject&quot; them.  Instead, simply realize that they are only a <em>part</em> of the tapestry of cosmic spirituality.  It&#39;s like rejecting a tree because it is not the forest.  Doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>That is a universal, unqualified comment which quite simply doesn&#39;t apply.  Religion disseminates a <em>lot</em> of false information, but that&#39;s not ALL it does.  If it did, then it simply wouldn&#39;t be as successful as it has been.  There is a lot about many religions that have a core of truth and correctness to them.  To reject that also is like throwing out the baby with the bath water - missing the forest for the trees.</p>

<p>You must learn how to be discerning, be a critical thinker, and sift the wheat from the chaff where it regards information you come across.</p>

<p>Religion is like training wheels for those that are just beginning to understand spirituality.  Training wheels are VERY important for those who don&#39;t know how to actually ride a bike yet.  They definitely have their place.  Without them, many people would get a lot more injured than they do.</p>

<p>When you learn how to ride a bike, then you can discard the training wheels - not before though.  Similarly, after you learn some of the core truths and tenets that many religions <em>do</em> have, then you can discard with the chaff and move on to further development.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that discarding religion en toto is the wisest, most intelligent thing to do, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are intrinsically violent and take advantage of everybody</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know quiet a few people that are religiously devout who are the very <em>opposite</em> of what you describe here.  But ONE example alone does away with what you&#39;re saying here - and I know of several people and examples that prove the universality of your statement summarily wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are against the advancement of proper knowledge and scientific discoveries</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Religion is generally against that which can entirely undermine it.  Many scientific discoveries and proper knowledge DON&#39;T entirely undermine it, however - and those types of discoveries many religions actually embrace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all discoveries go against the stupid teachings from their stupid books and help debunks all the myths in which their whole structure is set up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are various extremes in life - almost any one of which should be stayed far, far away from.  There is religious extremism that doesn&#39;t understand or believe in anything that is not specifically quoted in the little books that adherents unquestioningly genuflect before.  That&#39;s not good.  On the other hand, however, there are also the types of people that just as ignorantly and unthinkingly discard anything and everything having to do with religion, not understanding the many aspects of it that are embedded in validity.</p>

<p>Both, again, should be stayed away from.  Middle-of-the-road critical thinking should be the order of the day.</p>

<p>Religion is a tool (and weapon) used to control people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds matter of fact. Familiar with Jainism? Not that I subscribe to Jainism, but I would like to see you point to how that religion is a weapon (given the negative innuendo). Your statement above is something comparable to a bit in a horses mouth. It is, in fact, sensationalism. Sensationalism is often used to manipulate aka control. Just like a bit, you steer the reader to your point of view using their emotional bias against them. That said, I have a soft spot for Christopher Hitchens.</p>

<p>Religion, in the Christian sense, is a system of beliefs (systematic theology). Belief is synonymous with doctrine according to Millard J Erickson, Karl Barth, Charles Swindol, and practically everyone else that is studied in Protestant seminaries.</p>

<p>Google definition- </p>

<p>re·li·gion</p>

<p><em>the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.
&quot;ideas about the relationship between science and religion&quot;
synonyms: faith, belief, worship, creed</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>...you need to reject all of humanity&#39;s religions and associated dogma</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for telling everyone what they need to do, but this is a silly thing to say. For one, &quot;humanity&#39;s religions&quot; will always apply to all theist systems except for the one that each particular person participates in. Obviously, they can&#39;t ALL be correct, but that is not a <em>personal</em> dilemma. It is rather a <em>collective</em> dilemma. Secondly, dogma is primarily a term used in Catholicism. Most protestants use the word doctrine. This allows people that do believe in &quot;humanity&#39;s religions&quot; to dismiss you as ignorant. Personally, I am ok with you using dogma here, but it is really a poor term to use in light of the theistic paradigm. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religion and spirituality are two separate things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course they are, but they always go together. Always. <em>Discipleship</em> is at the core of all major religions. To dismiss it, is to tell people to never study, listen, et hoc genus omne. It really doesn&#39;t make sense to say that spirituality is an exclusive term. It is different than religion, but how can one come to spiritual enlightenment without a set of beliefs (religion)?</p>

<p>I agree with the thrust of what OP says. His questions in the last paragraph are particularly well thought out and proper for self-reflection. Noping your way through the questions serve of zero value.  </p>

<p>Most all major religions, and even the occult, have end time prophecies that could be used by tptb with great results using PSYOPS. On that basis alone is it not worth considering what they are all saying, especially in light of the Bohemian Grove Club, transhumanism, singularity, etc?</p>

<p>I would expound further and say that religion (from &#39;ligare&#39; meaning to tie or bind, and &#39;re&#39; meaning again) is the antithesis of spirituality. Spirituality is a journey of self-discovery more than anything, finding freedom from dogma and a discovery of the truth no matter how strange it might seem. Spirituality is discovering one&#39;s own purpose through exploration, reflection, and contemplation. Religion is adopting a prefabricated belief system.</p>

<p>Religion was engineered for conformity, indoctrination, control, group-think, etc... These are very much opposed to any sense of individuality, which spirituality is all about in my opinion.</p>

<p>Awesome! I&#39;ve only ever had one experience with salvia but it was so intense that it completely stripped away my ego and all sense of self that I had. Being able to experience that is so humbling and definitely produces an instant change of perception. </p>

<p>All of that stuff that people say about psychadelics that sounds like bullshit is absoultely true and it usually only takes one experience to realize it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was impressive. I wrote the whole thing up here (long!): <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/2jd8ov/first_ayahuasca_ceremony_report_long/">http://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/2jd8ov/first_ayahuasca_ceremony_report_long/</a></p>

<p>But the tl;dr is that I strongly suspect there is a more fundamental layer of reality to which ayahuasca allows access. This is coming from a staunch materialist -- atheist, master&#39;s degree in mechanical engineering.</p>

<p>We are the Universe experiencing itself. Thus, we are God. So, think of it this way: God splits at the Big Bang to experience infinity in all possible combinations. This requires delusion in order for our imaginations to procure all possibilities. However, for the continuation of Self, in order to reduce entropy, it slowly becomes aware of itself, and eventually, conscious singularity occurs. Upon this occurance, &#39;We&#39;, God, Life, Nirvana, Brahman, Reality, Motion, Infinity incarnate, can move to a Type 1 civilization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> is a subreddit dedicated to new science that proves the all is within each piece, much like the allegory of Indra&#39;s Net, or DNA in a cell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each &quot;eye&quot; of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering &quot;like&quot; stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring.[7]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, you mean a soul. I would say the best answer to this would be the concept of Ta&#39;veren found in Robert Jordan&#39;s Wheel of Time. We are threads in a pattern, spun in when our time comes again. Never quite the same, but also the same in that we are serving a purpose, a function in each time we are spun in. All equally important. E.g. There is a messiah, one who can bring us to the realization of what we are. It must perform certain functions, such as the Breaking of the World as the result of revealing vernacular truth. However, other aspects of the messiah are volatile. E.g. where they are born, their name, how they are lead to their conclusions about reality, etc. The essence of the spirit, like reality itself, is both ever changing and ever the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched that whole series over the course of the year. The guy seems very earnest, a little overly credulous, but not huckstery. I think the content of his message is spot on. I fear he is too quick to accept his huckster peers. </p>

<p>For instance, I think Nassim Haramein is an obvious fraud. Its clear he doesn&#39;t know any of the math he claims his theories are based on, and his examples of proving all the physicists in the room wrong are elementary (he has a balloon example he gives in some of his lectures where he misapplies a conceptual model and states that since physicists cannot explain who is filling up the balloon, then none of the current theories of gravity/mass/cosmology can be correct.) Patchman, on the other hand, offers Nassim&#39;s &#39;theories&#39; as on par with any mainstream physico-mathematic theory of reality. </p>

<p>But, really, am I one to talk? I feel that the atlantean origins described throughout spirit science (themselves based on theosophy) are compelling if considered from the perspective of multidimensionality. For instance, the physical history/evolution of man follows a more or less standard progression, but the conscious aspect of man exists in eternity, and has actually experienced an atlantean state as it developed, prior to uniting with the current physical form. So we all got some crank in us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>except we&#39;re not... these are nice things to say to people... but time is limited... and there are people who enjoy their existence and there are those who do not.  there are people who take arms against those who enjoy their existence because they have so much and they so little. Its the classic elite / plebian dichotomy.</p>

<p>But that stems from an even more fundamental dichotomy... there are people who know things that others do not... call it the wisdom gap.  As long as someone knows something someone else doesn&#39;t know - and instead of bringing them up to their level of wisdom (which you would do if you do indeed follow the path of one mind), you use it to your advantage and their disadvantage....  then we are not one.</p>

<p>But what if we educate everyone... indeed what typically happens when one gets information that could give him what he/she desires that someone who has what he/she wants doesn&#39;t have?  in the mindset of need, an animalistic desire, they use it to eat the other one and make their stuff his/her stuff by way of their actions. its classic patriarchal hierarchy. like fish in the ocean.. you get to the top by using the tools you have to eat the fish that dont have the tools to stop you.</p>

<p>our mythology tells of this fundamental problem in the human condition over and over... one of the first tales is that of ramses versus the jews... then of cain and abel.... of the people of seth vs the people of cain...which becomes the sons of seth (noah) vs the sons of cain... when the sons of cain are wiped out... seth is given knowledge that he ddistributes amongst his sons... and the wisdom gap is formed.</p>

<p>some might think it isn&#39;t good/evil.. it isn&#39;t rich/poor  or light/dark....   its he and she.  she made him and therefor we are just drones to her. but the only way she could make he was if she had just a little bit more knowledge than he... knowledge of how to build a robot that was essentially the same as her... but limited in its ability to perceive the dimension that gave her power.  knowledge is information... and she has roughly 1/8 more DNA than we do, as well as the same DNA in all of our mithochondria. </p>

<p>We are in fact one. A lady inside a bunch of robot bodies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a very salient point. The notion of the more wise elite seems foolish. If the understanding from a &#39;higher&#39; perspective is that we are all one, then the conclusion is that hurting others is hurting the self. However, it may be the case that hurting the self is a legitimate expression of will. As such, there is no moral reason against self-harm inherent in the statement &quot;we are all one&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You hit it bang on the head! The ultimate conspiracy!</p>

<p>The elimination of true spirituality from the hearts and minds of the human beings on this planet is a NWO agenda of the first order. The NWO CANNOT survive if people have a developed conscious spiritual existence and are not focused 100% on physical material things. </p>

<p>ALL the religious organizations have been taken over and corrupted...I think the Tibetan Buddhism of the Dalai Lama and the Karmapa are uncorrupted. But the major religious <em>institutions</em> are going hard retard at repulsing people from exploring their spirituality. To lift up your spirit with some philosophical and spiritual truth please read Krishnamurti...read Rudolf Steiner...read some Thich Nhat Hanh...read Jakob Böhme or some Goethe. Nietzsche will not lift you up (but read it for an example of a &quot;retarded&quot; philosophy)...Richard Dawkins suggests that you are only an &quot;advanced animal&quot; (and just barely!) with a &quot;god delusion&quot;...doing more than suggesting that all spirituality is &quot;pathological&quot;! We should all pay great attention to the theme presented here...it truly is the ace up our sleeve and no NWO government can take it away from us. It dispels the fear which the NWO thrives on. It lifts us up and empowers us with no state control, no parental control, no academic or military control. And we can reach a true spirituality through our thinking...but we need to work harder at it and not simply accept it as a concept or thought and move on...add it to your life...make it a daily event with every breath. Be as skeptical as fuck but don&#39;t let your skepticism drive you away from being a moral and ethical spiritual human being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not unwarranted. Doing MATH is a spiritual exercise...why? Because it is NOT a material thing...it is using your <em>mind</em> within the constructs created by other <em>minds</em> in history and the &quot;exercise&quot; is purely thought based...which is a spiritual activity. Perhaps you should re-evaluate what a spiritual activity is for yourself, I think some <em>thoughts</em> are spiritual! ( I am not assuming that it is &quot;heavenly&quot; but I am assuming that it is the opposite of material) </p>

<p>&quot;Spiritual&quot; doesn&#39;t make it holy or ethical but it certainly is not necessarily something materially born. What I mean to say is that our morals and ethics need to be based on less material considerations and more on our heart and feelings...which are what makes us human and full of love and warmth. </p>

<p>But I will digress and admit that the word &quot;spiritual&quot; certainly is a little vague and I will try to be clearer next time! If you really want to get into it try this book on size...<a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/English/RSPI1963/GA004_index.html">http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/English/RSPI1963/GA004_index.html</a>
It&#39;ll blow your mind and I assure you that it will inspire a reflection of what the word &quot;spiritual&quot; really means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to support you here, Hermeticist Franz Bardon stipulated the tripartite nature of conscious existence - Spiritual, Astral, Physical. The physical is what we all take it to be. The astral is similar to platonic archetypes. But the spiritual is purely &#39;mental&#39;. In the spiritual there is no form and no time. In the astral there is form but no time. In the physical there is both form and time. Bardon made an explicit connection to the Spiritual as the raw mental plane, ie conception without form. So there is a tradition amongst metaphysical thinkers that spirit = mind.</p>

<p>Anthroposophy (Rudolf Steiner) divides man up into the physical body, etheric body, astral body and ego which then related to material measurable things on the physical plane, formative life forces in the etheric body (recharges during sleep), sensual consciousness in the astral plane as well as it is connected to our desires and passions, and finally, the EGO which is what separates us from the animals...our ability to refer to myself as an &quot;I&quot;. </p>

<p>Show me some proof, and I&#39;ll believe you. So far, there is absolutely no evidence that says that we are anything more than animals. You&#39;re telling us to read? Good idea.

    <div class="md"><p>The complex workings of the human mind and consciousness can&#39;t be so easily understood by reading a few books.  At best neuroscience has uncovered the rules of how the brain functions chemically/biologically on a basic level, but that doesn&#39;t explain everything.  It&#39;s like claiming you have a total grasp on the depth of the game of chess after simply reading the rules of the game.</p>

<p>A lot of the people suggesting that spirituality is significant are intelligent, critical thinking people like yourself.  They don&#39;t have scientific proof of their beliefs, but rather their own experiences have given them evidence to consider that our brains are capable of more than just driving our animal bodies.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s very arrogant to assume that because we belong to a civilization which has achieved high technology, that everyone who ever lived who had extra-scientific beliefs was totally misguided.</p>

<p>There is also just a huge rift with stuff between people who meditate and do psychedelics and those who don&#39;t.  I can&#39;t blame you for thinking this is all horse shit.

<p>Serious science has only been at it for a few decades. So far, we&#39;ve uncovered tons of new information.

<p>We&#39;ve spend millenia with this approach of basing ourselves on faith, with no real results and no tangible end ot human suffering. Modern scientists are less than 0.0000000001% of all humans who have lived and have produced so much in so short a time.

<p>Those two thingsd have been extensively studied. We KNOW why they affect the brain, and it&#39;s all the result of chemical reactions. The &quot;personal experience&quot; you have as a drug consumer has been extensively catalogued. Don&#39;t be condescending to people who don&#39;t use. In fact, I spend a lot of time meditating everyday, but only because a guy called Kabat Zinn has devoted years and years of his life to understand in a scientific way why meditation works.

    <div class="md"><p>But before science there was faith, and with faith, science can prevail. Whether you like it or not, a person isn&#39;t born dismissing God or faith. People don&#39;t start doing that until they&#39;re young adults and give up easily to what others tell them. People like them are the type to be like &quot;Ok, if God was real then why can&#39;t I see him? Why can&#39;t I hear him? Why isn&#39;t there a source backing this up?&quot; or give up when God doesn&#39;t give them what they want right then and there. Just like science, you can&#39;t expect answers right away. You have to invest time and look for answers yourself. </p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;ve noticed that those who don&#39;t believe in anything seem to be less happy. Let&#39;s say they wish something could happen and science tells them it&#39;s impossible, then that&#39;s it. That&#39;s the end of the road...until science says other wise, but with faith, you can at least believe what you want and that it&#39;s possible. You don&#39;t just accept no for an answer. But I must admit that I&#39;m not into religion, or going to church or believe that preaching is doing gods work. I DO believe that there is God and that it is way more complex than the human mind can handle or explain.</p>

<p>The big bang isn&#39;t a belief, it&#39;s a working model of the universe that has a lot to support it, unlike God.</p>

<p>The big bang <em>theory</em> relies on assumptions, two of which being the existence of things called &quot;dark matter&quot; and &quot;dark energy&quot; which collectively comprise (supposedly) over 95% of the universe but which cannot be measured or seen in any way or with any equipment.</p>

<p>Your placing complete faith in scientific dogma is no different than someone placing their complete faith in religion.  That was my point.</p>

<p>If you have evidence that indicates some suppressed metaphysical truth then have at it, but I personally have seen credulity abused one too many times.</p>

<p>I think the &quot;planned problem&quot; may have more to do with the spending habits and political agenda of the Western middle class (indeed if there is any remaining in the near future) than some long hidden religious secret or what have you.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think spirituality, the new age movement, Scientology and other cults, and the primary Abrahamic religions are the cause of conspiracies that are STILL happening and STILL being created? You think the Vatican is sitting there not interfering with the world, like they have been for hundreds of years?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. I would say it&#39;s rather difficult to describe in a straightforward way, and that&#39;s why typically it&#39;s described in allegory and parable. On a global level, one metaphor would be that we as humans make up humanity in the same way the cells in your body make up a human.  Your skin and brain cells are distinct, yet they are not separate.  They work together for a purpose, for your body to survive, grow, and learn, yet each part is not necessarily aware of the exact mechanisms by which they are connected.  In the same way the cells of your body die and are replaced, so too do we as humans die and become replaced by our children, yet the overall form and intelligence of the greater whole is preserved and even furthered.</p>

<p>The analogy falls apart in that unlike our cells, we have the ability to become aware of ourselves and our interconnections.  By understanding and working within such a framework, we as a species can survive, thrive, grow and learn. </p>

<p>As far as who the &quot;they&quot; are, i have an idea but this is only my opinion.  I believe &quot;they&quot; are a like a DNA transcriptase error causing a cancerous mutation.  The cells of our species body could serve the whole and therefore benefit themselves, but for some reason act on a different set of principles.  In cancer, cells rapidly multiply, consume more resources than normal, and ultimately kill the body.  </p>

<p>I believe greed in humans operates in the same way.  A man may by force or deceit get his fellow humans to accumulate resources in a way which benefits him in the short term.  He may be a king or a high priest, and have his subjects clear a forest so he may have wood to build and burn for heat. For a while, he is rich, maybe even for several generations of his sons. But eventually, The forests are bare, the soil is depleted, and the kingdom starves.  The &#39;kings&#39; of our world have used religion and other means to control the people, and have been able to delay the inevitable collapse by plundering fresh lands and peoples.  But as religion has been used as a disease, i believe it can be the cure as well.  If the people become aware that by feeding the greed of our present cancer they are destroying themselves, we can choose to stop feeding the all consuming fire.  We can choose to align ourselves a higher purpose for humanity to grow, learn and thrive.  No god is required for this to work, but it served as a useful metaphor in times past.  The downside of the metaphor is that it was corrupted and used for control.</p>

<p>Anyway, like I said these are only my opinions, what do you think?</p>

This corruption dates back to the beginning of time and will probably nvr stop. The history of secret societies is very long and detailed. I doubt I could explain it to u. I suggest u read up on it for at the very least is very interesting. Secret societies are a religion. Most if not all worship Satan So god is very real and theres no denying it. </p>

<p>Read Young&#39;s Literal Translation (YLT). I&#39;ve found that it is the most untainted translation.</p>

<p>You can also get a copy of the Septuagint, which is the Greek translation of the OT that was translated before Christ, so again, no theological bent. It&#39;s also what the apostles and Christ taught from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How would one seek out Christianity&#39;s true core when they&#39;ve been corrupt for over a thousand years?</p>

<p>Seek Christ. Learn the truth from your own reading, and let God guide you. And, just know that the core is this: Love God with all your heart, soul and might. Love your neighbor as yourself. Have nothing to do with idolatry or sexual immorality. Trust Yeshua, the Son of God and Messiah, to be your master. That&#39;s it! That&#39;s the core.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s BS. You can&#39;t trust much of what the modern church teaches, regardless of the denomination. As Paul taught, &quot;For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.&quot; When he spoke of sound doctrine, he spoke of the simple rules I listed above.</p>

<p>Anything Science &quot;proved&quot; isn&#39;t really proof it ends up being just like religion you believe if because you&#39;re told someone smarter then you who studies it believes it as such; but you u have no proof.</p>

<p>You have no proof the big bang theory happened, You Have no Proof there is no Creator, You have no proof the planet is only 4.5 billion years old. You have no proof humans built some of the wonders on this planet (Stonehenge and what lays beneath it, Pyramids...etc)</p>

<p>The thing with proof is none of it is actually proof unless you discovered it yourself, It ends up just being you believing what someone else tells you for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Science is a Religion in itself used to steer humanity and its decisions and consumption in a certain area.</p>

<p>After studying the scriptures for some time a testimony is born out of faith. The holy ghost gives you the affirmation that what you are reading is true. If you have never read the scriptures you will nvr gain a testimony unless you see a miracle of sum kind. All the evidence u require is in books. The bible, the Quran, the book of Mormon, the Torah ect. 
Religion is the answer to all of the unanswerable questions that has plagued mankind from the beginning of time. 
Where did we come from? Is death the end? Is there a god?  And so on. </p>

<p>Wrong. You do need rules.

    <div class="md"><p>I would say if you get to detachment and love without what you consider to be religion or spirituality, good job.  Religion and spirituality are just two words to describe various ways of getting to that point, but they have a lot of extra baggage too. I would say if you reach a state of love, that you are spiritual, but i completely understand if you feel that word is not accurate.</p>

<p>The holy books have been used to oppress and to liberate, to control and enlighten.  The difference is the attitude with which they are approached, or the manner in which they are taught.  When used as an instrument of fear, they form a prison for the mind.  When approached with wonder and devotion to truth, they can be the sword which severs the chains of attachment.</p>

It can be used to understand a very limited range of human experience, the physical part that we perceive through our senses. Atheists make the error of assuming that what we perceive is all there is. But human experience is much larger, and what lies beyond the senses science cannot even touch.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not an error.  It&#39;s a belief in the same way that you (and I) believe in a higher power, or soul, or whatever.  They simply want physical, repeatable evidence to back up their beliefs and there is nothing wrong with that.  I mean, we consistently try to use science and physical evidence to prove our faith when it benefits us, while at the same time throwing science aside when it doesn&#39;t line up with what we believe.  Is that not wrong in your eyes?</p>

<p>Science doesn&#39;t &quot;pretend spirituality does not exist&quot;, it just knows it&#39;s own limits.  It can&#39;t prove or disprove things like spirituality, so there&#39;s no point in even addressing it.</p>

<p>I mean, science for the most part needs concrete things to work with.  Spirituality is infinitely diverse; different for every single human being (or can be at least).  How would you measure spirituality in a way that science <em>could</em> use it in any plausible or reasonable way?  If science included someone&#39;s version of spirituality in an equation or experiment, that outcome would be wrong for someone who has a differing view of spirituality.</p>

<p>Science simply means &quot;to know&quot;.  It&#39;s a quest for truth using mediums that everyone can see, touch, use equally (for the most part) and it simply cannot rely on anecdotal experiences to drive it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a Christian since I was 14.  I was a hardcore atheist before that.  After I became a Christian, I did the typical religious things and thought science was a crock.  Dismissed everything that (I thought) contradicted my faith as quackery.</p>

<p>Now, I love science.  Seeing the wondrous and remarkable things this world, offers is awesome.  My faith has been strengthened by embracing science instead of shunning it.  We always look at all the huge things (we believe) that God has made because huge things are in fact awesome...but with that same power, He made the tiniest, most complex things in the universe that when viewed or study should send chills down your spine.</p>

<p>Anyways, all that to say that science and faith can coexist...and it&#39;s awesome.  I think you are oversimplifying atheists and science.</p>

<p>We use, or should only use, science when we need the tool of science, to determine question about material matters. Science has nothing to say of anything that lies beyond the material, because it cannot deal with it. You don&#39;t use a hammer to compose a symphony -- you use a hammer to drive nails, the function for which it is designed. The point most people fail to grasp is how limited science is, as a tool. It can deal with only a tiny portion of our reality, and the rest, it can not touch.</p>

<p>Your spirituality is also limited because you cannot prove to me that what you believe to be real is real.  What you believe to be a soul is in fact a soul.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve converted many an atheist from anti religion to pro spirituality with the following book:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversations_with_God">Conversations with God by Neil Donald Walsch</a>.  To our resident atheists I say this....it&#39;s no small wonder, given the history of the world&#39;s religions, that you are turned off to the idea of a sky chief floating up over the rainbow.  Give this book a try, it may change your life for the better, but just know that even if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s still all good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they&#39;re open-minded and the argument is sound. I moved from the standard issue militant atheism of Dawkins/Harris/Dennett to a spiritual worldview after reading, considering, and practicing the dictates of various faiths. I don&#39;t think that my desire to expand my understanding of human actions reflected weakness in my mind. Quite the opposite. My mind was sound, the materialist dogma was weak.</p>

<p>Chief among them, something both Buddha and Christ spoke of, the only reality is the present. It&#39;s folly to dwell on the past or worry about the future, you&#39;re ceding your own agency in the moments you&#39;re doing that. That&#39;s why nature is so important to me, because I can find happiness and peace in the appreciation and presence of natural beauty and settings. </p>

The reason that &quot;spiritual warfare&quot; type posts don&#39;t get as much traction as others is because there are a ton of more concrete issues that we need to wrap our minds around.</p>

<p>Is there a dark cabal of cloak-ladden figures using the occult to gain power?  I don&#39;t know, but that doesn&#39;t matter one way or the other until I can get people to realize something as clear and concrete as the fact that the dollar is a tool of theft and control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be far better if a clandestine bunch of occultists were running the world, they&#39;d probably have an aim and an ideal behind it all.   The sad fact is this - the world is fucked up, millions are starving, being raped, murdered, molested, cheated, slave-driven, living in absolute destitution all for one thing - money.  Every war has always been about money, they dress it up as &#39;for religion&#39; or &#39;for your country&#39;, but that&#39;s just to get the sheeple to sacrifice themselves.  Behind it all is just some greedy fuck who wants some more cash, land or other revenue stream.  </p>

<p>Once you realize that the only reason this world is completely in the shitter is because a tiny minority of people want more money the better.  I think they push the idea that they&#39;re all into the occult to make them appear more interesting than they really are.  They haven&#39;t got time to put robes on, they&#39;ve got wars, murder and which kids to fuck next to think about.</p>

<p>The aim of power, whether through finance or politics has just two aims - firstly the money, lots and lots of money!  Secondly - sex.</p>

<p>Nobody with any real spiritual knowledge could ever bring themselves to harm anything, yet these bastards will happily watch videos of kids being murdered.  It&#39;s all about the money for them, and that&#39;s it!  </p>

<p>They&#39;re all psychopaths.  Look at the qualities they aspire too, the man who stops at nothing to get what he wants, the man who wins against all the odds, the super-hero who is all powerful, the most successful businessman, the homeless man who puts his family on the line just to land a job and start making some real big money.  We have been programmed to admire psychopaths.  All the qualities we are meant to aspire to are symptoms of a psychopathic character.  We all do though.  I admire Steve Jobs, but I know he was a fucking nutcase.  They are all fruit the fucking loop but we still look up to them because our brains have been programmed by the professionals since the moment we squirted out of our mum&#39;s pussy.  </p>

<p>What can we do?  That&#39;s the big question.  How can we shatter the program?  However, we will have to shatter ourselves in the process, all of us are fucked in the head, stop denying it.  Admit to yourself that your brain has been worked on and start again.  However, I haven&#39;t got a clue how to do it.  They&#39;ve done a great job on us all, that&#39;s for sure.  </p>

<p>The part of you that exists even when the physical conditions necessary to your physical manifestation are not present. If you accept that you are solely matter (whatever that is) then you accept that YOU are only a configuration of that matter. The informational context in which that matter is expressed is the soul. The matter is the body. Or to put it another way, the soul is the function that produces you in the substrate of matter (and perhaps other substrates as well.) The function always exists (ie, is eternal). The configuration of matter occasionally exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can get all the evidence you need by practicing meditation techniques detailed in Franz Bardon&#39;s &quot;Initiation into Hermetics&quot; (other books as well, this one is just remarkably clear and concise). Begin by quieting the mind. Proceed to visualizing an interior space. Populate that interior space with dynamic elements. Test the interior space with interior elements tied to &quot;external&quot; spaces -&gt; clocks that keep real time, places and people you know in objective space. Project your consciousness into these spaces. Record what you experience. It is really that simple. It takes time, every step I&#39;ve described is a project in itself, but once you&#39;ve had your first self-induced out of body experience, you&#39;ll have all the evidence YOU need.</p>

I hole heatedly believe in science and, its amazballs by the way, but everything we know as fact is not actually fact. It is proven to a point and than it can no longer be proven. I understand we do not know everything and as far as we know we as people have just started to learn.</p>

<p>I think existence in its self is amazing, being aware of all of it just as crazy. Being able to almost prove a lot of what we see is crazy. I&#39;m rambling at this point. We have a sliver of information, I like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m kind of with OP on this one.</p>

<p>Whenever I was kicked out of a youth group at age 15 for having a bisexual girlfriend, I denounced christianity. For awhile I tried wicca, then buddhism, then eventually I decided I was an atheist. </p>

<p>This didn&#39;t exactly go as planned. I made a lot of bad decisions, knowing that I wouldn&#39;t have any kind of spiritual or religious punishment for them. But they were bad decisions and effected my immediate life.</p>

<p>I was a militant atheist, I scorned christians and anyone of the abrahamic religions, calling them all deluded sheep. I wasn&#39;t making friends anywhere I went.</p>

<p>Then I just gave up. There was no reason to fight. Sure, organized religions still has some shit-stains that run the gamut and butt into law-making, but those chuckleheads are a minority. The majority of spiritual people just want love and peace.</p>

<p>I was invited to a Mormon church the other week. I still haven&#39;t went, but I&#39;ve been thinking of going. Not to argue or debate, but just listen. From what I know they may be the most deluded of all religions, with a backstory that would make scientologists seem sane. But I&#39;ll tell you one thing, I&#39;ve never met an unhappy mormon. The culture of their religion is something I want to have in my life, even though I will make it abundantly clear to them that I&#39;m not going to just bow down and accept everything they tell me without question.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s all a sticky subject. I&#39;m just tired of fighting for nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate this sentiment, but I think and believe authority always has to be distrusted because it is always a shortcut to actual human relationships.  </p>

<p>Instead of having to explain yourself and answering questions, you just order people to do things like you might press an elevator button, it&#39;s mechanical not human.  </p>

<p>Things that are beliefs and can&#39;t ever be proven, that are outside the realm of science, or very far from our current level, are the least verifiable things, and thus they are the least likely we are to agree upon. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t focus on religion when discussing politics and the need for revolution because it is inherently divisive and it&#39;s what I can be the least sure about.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile I am dead certain that the power structure that is neo-thisorthat plus corporatism is going to wipe out most life on the planet and likely leave only a few of the richest people standing to write the history of their triumph, and potentially seed the galaxy, leaving the actual history of the people who were mowed down and snuffed out to be discovered, if ever, by alien archeologists who don&#39;t think the story of the remaining humans adds up.  </p>

<p>I find that a lot more verifiable than anything about jesus/moses/muhammed/shakras or anything like that.  </p>

<p>The wealthy people in the usa and most of the world are criminals who rig the political system to make themselves all powerful off the blood of millions and millions of people, under all the religions it is considered super evil yet how many anti-abortion protestors do I see protesting capitalism with me?  </p>

<p>None.  Religious people in this regard are utter sheep, excepting a few awesome nuns and unitarians.  </p>

<p>So until I see more religious people, especially from these giant mansion-like mega tv churches all over the usa, expect some derision as being part of the problem.  </p>

<p>I just picked the first reasons for all this that came to mind, but I think I could write a book on why I disagree with the proposition that &#39;the coming revolution needs to be more spiritual&#39;</p>

<p>The music of the revolution may be bob marley but it will not be the christian fucking hymnbook, that&#39;s what the police will be singing as they piss themselves.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. Unfortunately atheism tastes good because people get hung up on why suffering exists if there is some god figure and they can&#39;t get past it so they dismiss all possibilities with a petulant tantrum. It is easier than reconciling a turbulent material existence and recognizing that we are all individually responsible.</p>

<p>I rarely bother with the spiritual angle unless someone says something about it first because it has been subverted and slandered so much more than other avenues of awakening. People keep blaming religion for terrorists instead of, you know, basic ignorance, fear and greed. Human failure doesn&#39;t need complicated -isms and systems of dogmatic ideals to be explained because the inner struggle is inherent in all humans regardless of their learned background. </p>

<p>Keep fighting the good fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I happen to agree with the main part of what you write. A spiritual dimension to human life is essential for that life to thrive and be happy. The reason so many people have turned away from Christianity recently has nothing to do with their own sudden decision to reject religion -- it has to do with social conditioning imposed on them from without by an atheistic, leftist ruling class that controls what gets taught in the schools and what gets played over the television and in movies. </p>

<p>People have been trained to reject religion, and spirituality in general, over the past five decades or so, and the result is what we see -- perversion, violence, lying, corruption, all of which would be less of a problem if the general public went to church and believed in a higher spiritual intelligence from which stems a moral code of behavior.</p>

<p>Take away God, and what do you base your moral or ethical code on? Nothing. And after a while, with God missing from the equation of life, people begin to realize that their moral code is based on nothing, and they start to reject the moral code, leaving them with ... nothing.</p>

<p>In my opinion, you cannot have spirituality without a framework for that spirituality, and that framework is religion. Religions exist for a reason. Humanity needs religion.</p>

Its an anthology of writings from the major world religions, organized by topic, under the thesis rather similar to your own, namely that there is a recurrent theme that mystics throughout history all formulate in their own way, within their own cultural trappings, of an ineffable spiritual truth.  It may be pointed at but not named, as in Zen&#39;s finger pointing to the moon.</p>

<p>If you do not fear death, you possess greater power than the cabal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can attest to this.  I am much older than most of you and have been on a spiritual path for 43 years.  Those early years were mostly wasted time where I flailed about, not making much progress, but these past 15, and <em>especially</em> the past three, I&#39;ve been advancing very quickly (I give it a lot of focus.) </p>

<p>Any yes, I&#39;ve gotten to the point where death is not a great concern.  My fear level is reduced perhaps 75% from where I was 15 years ago. </p>

<p>Our fascist overlords are pushing us into an increasingly hedonistic, selfish and materialistic direction. Sex isn&#39;t about the joining of souls, it&#39;s just for the titillation of nerve endings.  And who benefits from the lack of strong love between men and women, who use each other as sex tools or props?  Exactly those who want to divide us, want to kill love and convince us it doesn&#39;t really exist, and who want us shaking in our boots at the prospect of death, and willing to do anything to prevent it.  </p>

<p>If they can get us to feel and think that way, we are putty in their hands.  Think of how different the world would look right now if all the thousands of people who sold the rest of us down the river to save their own necks, had not been so afraid of death.  </p>

<p>I am so glad to see this point being made in r/conspiracy as it is key to retaining your dignity and calm when the SHTF.  To the extent that you identify with that within you that never dies, death loses its sting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Religion is a tool (and weapon) used to control people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds matter of fact. Familiar with Jainism? Not that I subscribe to Jainism, but I would like to see you point to how that religion is a weapon (given the negative innuendo). Your statement above is something comparable to a bit in a horses mouth. It is, in fact, sensationalism. Sensationalism is often used to manipulate aka control. Just like a bit, you steer the reader to your point of view using their emotional bias against them. That said, I have a soft spot for Christopher Hitchens.</p>

<p>Religion, in the Christian sense, is a system of beliefs (systematic theology). Belief is synonymous with doctrine according to Millard J Erickson, Karl Barth, Charles Swindol, and practically everyone else that is studied in Protestant seminaries.</p>

<p>Google definition- </p>

<p>re·li·gion</p>

<p><em>the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.
&quot;ideas about the relationship between science and religion&quot;
synonyms: faith, belief, worship, creed</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>...you need to reject all of humanity&#39;s religions and associated dogma</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for telling everyone what they need to do, but this is a silly thing to say. For one, &quot;humanity&#39;s religions&quot; will always apply to all theist systems except for the one that each particular person participates in. Obviously, they can&#39;t ALL be correct, but that is not a <em>personal</em> dilemma. It is rather a <em>collective</em> dilemma. Secondly, dogma is primarily a term used in Catholicism. Most protestants use the word doctrine. This allows people that do believe in &quot;humanity&#39;s religions&quot; to dismiss you as ignorant. Personally, I am ok with you using dogma here, but it is really a poor term to use in light of the theistic paradigm. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religion and spirituality are two separate things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course they are, but they always go together. Always. <em>Discipleship</em> is at the core of all major religions. To dismiss it, is to tell people to never study, listen, et hoc genus omne. It really doesn&#39;t make sense to say that spirituality is an exclusive term. It is different than religion, but how can one come to spiritual enlightenment without a set of beliefs (religion)?</p>

<p>I agree with the thrust of what OP says. His questions in the last paragraph are particularly well thought out and proper for self-reflection. Noping your way through the questions serve of zero value.  </p>

<p>Most all major religions, and even the occult, have end time prophecies that could be used by tptb with great results using PSYOPS. On that basis alone is it not worth considering what they are all saying, especially in light of the Bohemian Grove Club, transhumanism, singularity, etc?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t so much &quot;reject&quot; them.  Instead, simply realize that they are only a <em>part</em> of the tapestry of cosmic spirituality.  It&#39;s like rejecting a tree because it is not the forest.  Doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t <em>reject</em> the tree - just realize that it is by no means the entire forest.  Look at it as what it is - part of a bigger, MUCH bigger, picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree entirely!</p>

<p>I would expound further and say that religion (from &#39;ligare&#39; meaning to tie or bind, and &#39;re&#39; meaning again) is the antithesis of spirituality. Spirituality is a journey of self-discovery more than anything, finding freedom from dogma and a discovery of the truth no matter how strange it might seem. Spirituality is discovering one&#39;s own purpose through exploration, reflection, and contemplation. Religion is adopting a prefabricated belief system.</p>

<p>Religion was engineered for conformity, indoctrination, control, group-think, etc... These are very much opposed to any sense of individuality, which spirituality is all about in my opinion.</p>
