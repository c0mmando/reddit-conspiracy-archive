       I find it more outrageous that people don't know about these issues after the fact that there's been a south park episode exposing that issue for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they made the cable company episode it was like "well this is a good 6-8 years overdue but whatever I'll take it, now people have no excuse because south park has made an episode out of it.".

       I will probably get flamed to hell for this...but I feel like getting 4 years of college education for running around holding a ball is pretty good compensation.

       I'm not sure most people know this, but it may start tipping that way. This documentary brought the debate right out into the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what would happen is the schools would refuse to pay, and would turn their programs into walk-on arrangements rather than pay scholarships and treat players like employees (with contracts, insurance, etc). There would probably sprout up a minor league for football, and the players would skip the charade of being college students. I wonder if in the long run that wouldn't be better for the schools.

       Yes the NCAA is an exploitative piece of shit, but it also happens to be the only thing standing between numerous, larger corporate entities and the complete capture of college athletics by big corporate money.  I'd think that this subreddit in particular would be more wary of the corporate-owned media (Disney-owned ESPN in particular) railing this hard against any entity.

       This is not a conspiracy, it's a well known fact. That's why students and unionizing and groups are suing the NCAA. 2014 has been rough for the NCAA and, so far and things are slowly changing for the better.

       That's what I used to think. TIL? Today you didn't learn anything. Today you just assumed you were right and already know it all. Watch the video if you can (it's streaming on netflix). The language in the title of the post was taken from IMDB, but the video explains how the NCAA behaves entirely like a cartel. It's really interesting - you'll like it.

       I think sports should be removed from institutions of learning, but that's me. It'd be nice to remove the problem. Sports do not make schools better and typically only bring down the academics overall in the name of winning.

       Foolsball should not be within 100 miles of "higher education" facilities.  It is guys running around in tights hitting each other.  School is for learning.  Gym facilities are for sports.

       I wouldn't go as far as that - obviously being a college athlete isn't compulsory. Though in the documentary one of the athletes laughed when in one of his history classes he learned about indentured servitude, because it reminded him of his situation.
