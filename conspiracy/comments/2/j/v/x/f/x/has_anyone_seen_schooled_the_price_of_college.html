    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure most people know this, but it may start tipping that way. This documentary brought the debate right out into the open.</p>

<p>I think what would happen is the schools would refuse to pay, and would turn their programs into walk-on arrangements rather than pay scholarships and treat players like employees (with contracts, insurance, etc). There would probably sprout up a minor league for football, and the players would skip the charade of being college students. I wonder if in the long run that wouldn&#39;t be better for the schools.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I used to think. TIL? Today you didn&#39;t learn anything. Today you just assumed you were right and already know it all. Watch the video if you can (it&#39;s streaming on netflix). The language in the title of the post was taken from IMDB, but the video explains how the NCAA behaves entirely like a cartel. It&#39;s really interesting - you&#39;ll like it.</p>
