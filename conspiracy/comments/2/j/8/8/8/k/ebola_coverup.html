       Hello
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . I'm not too great at posting, but I thought you guys would want this information. In Fairfax Hospital, in Fairfax County, Virginia there is a patient with Ebola being treated.  The nurses, doctors, etc have been instructed not to let the information leak but I know somebody who works in the wing where the patient was before diagnosis. I think the government is covering up this story because it is so close to the capital, people would panic. That is all, I hope to god that my information is incorrect.

       There have been reports about Inova Fairfax Hospital taking part in Ebola drills, to include fake patients. Perhaps this is what your friend witnessed.

       I'm not sure if that's the case here but drills do have a convenient way of getting everyone on their top performance and well prepared when going into it without all the panic and chaos of knowing it's the real deal.

       I can't say you have any reason to trust me at all. I just find it odd that my friend that's a nurse says that there is an Ebola patient in her hospital, but there has been nothing on the news about it. That is why it's concerning. Meanwhile, every person that has a fever is being quarantined and put in the news in other cities

       No, but interestingly enough I live in Richmond and though this was just a suspicion of ebola, it was all over the news here. So why is an actual case being hidden from the media?

       If you believe this to be fact you should tell people.  This is not something that should be kept secret.  More information would be very helpful, and you should consider posting in

       what puzzles me, you have the late dead Liberian guy who lives in a small apartment with one or two adults and five kids for several days.

      <p>
       hes shitting, pissing and vomiting, sneezing all over the place. yet the five kids go to four different schools and don't pass on the Ebola to the other kids.

      <p>
       yet one Dallas nurse (with same name as a Houston doctor) contracts Ebola despite being fully space suited up.

       I believe it because my so works in a hospital in the northeast which I won't name and they had a suspected ebola patient for the 21 day isolation period then discharged him. It was never mentioned in the news but all the staff at the hospital knew about it and were on edge. They are definitely not telling us the whole story because let's face it. We are a panicky flock o sheep

       I will do my best to explain this phenomenon known as
       <a href="http://www.newsfocus.org/media_control.htm">
        Media Deception
       </a>
       .

       Anyone who isn't a complete moron already knows that ebola is "partially airborne" meaning it can be transmitted via
       <a href="http://youtu.be/DXn4_Ncb0jA">
        coughing and sneezing
       </a>
       which as most of us know contain aerosolized droplets of bodily fluids that viruses use as transport. According to the CDC (and if you watch that video you'll see they add a disclaimer) Its not airborne by their definition of the word "airborne". This is their way to placate the masses and instill calm under the guise of a technicality. "Well technically it isn't fully airborne but you can contract it via bodily fluids". sneezes and coughing is how this disease is being transmitted mostly. If the method of infection was so simple like hiv aids is transmitted we wouldn't be seeing such a huge surge in the number of infections nor would we be hearing about entire neighborhoods being quarantined off.  Don't believe everything the mainstream media tells you. It's all only half true and if you really have a hard time wrapping your head around this possibility i recommend you watch
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/">
        Contagion
       </a>
       and get a glimpse into how agencies like the CDC and FEMA manipulate the media and lie to the public to prevent the masses from engaging in a widespread panic. And if you think it's all just science fiction.. well my friend you have a real problem. I would say god help us but i don't think he will.

       You have no proof that there's an actual case.

       Why don't you call local media and alert them?   This is ratings gold
