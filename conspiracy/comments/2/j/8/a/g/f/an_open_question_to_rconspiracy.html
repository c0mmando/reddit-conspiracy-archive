       It seems to me that most of the information used to develop a conspiracy theory is primarily found on the Internet. Mostly from sites that have recycled, embellished, removed or otherwise taken the point out of context. My question to you is; why won't anyone step forward and join the DoD, CIA, FBI, FEMA, NSA or any other organization that would have something to hide. The CIA posts on its website the basic requirements to become an analyst with them. If our world is so fucked then why is no one trying to stop what is happening and merely just past information around? Wouldn't it make sense to look at things from the inside? The employees that would run any secret program have to come from somewhere, why not you?

       Why do we need secret programs at all?

       Why would people who stand against secret programs and black budget shadowy government agencies want to be a cog in their compartmentalized machine?

       Do you really think that you join the CIA as a low level analyst and suddenly have access to all the information they are hidding?

       I'm pretty certain he actually used higher up people's credentials to get some of that info. Also I believe he was working on the tech side of things meaning he had some access that a standard employee would not have. Just like your IT guy can see your boss's emails, doesn't mean he has the power to do what your boss does.

       The things Snowden hasn't mentioned are the really interesting ones. He's acting as if it's possible to be secure on the internet from the NSA. Apparently he's a hacker who's unfamiliar with Van Eck Phreaking and that the NSA monitors "unintentional intelligence bearing signals" in the atmosphere as part of its TEMPEST program.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the very tip of the iceberg.

       3 things. First is that there are many whistleblowers. If you don't think people are blowing the whistle all the time then you need to read more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, have you seen how whistleblowers get treated?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings me to my third point. If you're already established there then you find out something is wrong you are going to have to decide if you want to give up your career and all of your experience to do "what is right". Most people aren't willing to do that or simply can't from a survival point of view.  (debit is a hell of way to live)
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, the kinds of peple youa re talking about who read about conspiracies and then want to do something are usually already in their mid 20's or older and have a career and a life. It's a pretty huge risk to give up your career to try and go into a field just so you can blow the whisle on what you think might be happening.

       Most information is "stringed" together from whistleblowers, disgruntled politicians/insiders, investigative journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the "stringing" is what draws the "theory" part until of course an irrefutable source comes forward such as government disclosure (Watergate, Iran-Contra) or whistleblowers compromising official programs (MK-Ultra)

       There is a time and a place for creating change from the inside.  This is not that time or place.  By joining these organizations (cia, fbi, military, etc) you become an accomplice to their crimes and tyranny.  We are past fixing the system... It's time to destroy it, piss on the ashes, and build something new... Viva la revolution!

       Do you know what happens to whistle blowers? They flee the country or get killed. Techically, doing what you are suggestion is treason* and I have no desire to be shot or jailed or seek asylum and be a world wide celebrity.

       Snoden supposedly put his life on the line to prove the completely illegal unconstitutional actions of the NSA.  Who has went to jail? Has the illegal actions stopped? What did it really accomplish?  Who did he save?

       My perspective is that the whole system has been infiltrated by corruption and converted into a bribery system. Therefore trying to go through the system to fix the system would be suicide.
