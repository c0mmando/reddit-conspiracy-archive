       Well that's good then. If you practice what you preach then I have 100% respect for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah I do have a card. I don't live above my means with it, I mostly have it to keep decent credit in case of the even event that I ever need it. Having a decent credit limit can be helpful in case of an emergency.
      </p>

       You could just have savings or emergencies supplies. In a real emergency, the credit card networks may not work. Bank runs happen without notice.

       Yeah if the emergency is that bad I agree that a CC will not help me. An emergency in my life could be avoided or greatly reduced with that money though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still working on building some savings and I have been gathering emergency supplies when I can. That's the plan.

       I agree with this. Something like 60% of all bankruptcies happen due to medical bills. Something like 80% of that 60% are people who actually had major health insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do the math, and youll find that roughly half of
       <strong>
        <em>
         all
        </em>
       </strong>
       bankruptcies are due to medical bills despite the individual having major insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a CC, but will only use it for medical emergencies if our savings get plundered and raped by the medical establishment in such an emergency.

       Please explain how a fictitous way of rating a human being via thier way of managing money will save someones life in an emergency?  I guess when crap hits the fan you can buy a car/house/boat... if you are making the assumption that having a credit card is the only way to be liquid enough financially to survive..then i alpologize for laughing out loud just now. I seriously cant think of why i need a cc or good rating to live.  Ive been without a cc for 5 yrs now and im WAY better off financially then before.  The belief that Americans NEED a cc or a good rating is a HUGE lie in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: debit card does not equal a cc.  People without cc's dont need to pay with checks or pay for everything with gold/silver/cash in hand.  I love how people just assume anyone doing anything different then themselves are just stupid.. ..maybe if they got off the band wagon they might learn a few things.

       Let's say for some reason I have to leave the place I am living and require first and last month's rent and a deposit to secure myself a new place to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I don't have that but I have $15k of room on my credit card I can easily make the transition to my new place and not have to worry about it or sleep on the street or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wont' save me in every situation, especially not an immediate on,e but in the event that I need money to survive and don't have it, the CC limit is always there.

       And there is your problem.  You've been trained to believe you need credit.  first and last for an apt is not a reason to need credit...i moved across country last year and im by no means considered rich. .just took planning and hard work.  and in what survival situation are you apt shopping?  Again us Americans have been taught that we deserve the right to walk into any business and walk out with anything we want even if we cant afford it.  How do you think people survived before the credit rating system??  Just like i am now.  Planning and saving and buying only what we can afford that day.  We are very liquid after just 5 yrs of living this way.  Theres a reason my dad was able to retire at 62 as a millwright... he saved and planned and now he quads every weekend anf is happy without any debt.

       What the heck? My problem? I don't know why you are telling me this stuff. You just ignored everything I've written. I've already said that I do not use my credit card to live beyond my means.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even provided you with an example of an emergency situation. You can't plan and save ahead for every emergency, that is the point. I don't get to shop around or save if it's an emergency and I'm forced to move.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already live like you do but have a card there just in case. There is absolutely no downside to this.

       He's ignoring your situation, because he needs to validate his. He obviously doesn't have much going for him, he sounds like a vagrant. You are in a situation where it's needed, but you sound like you aren't abusing it, with 15K limit you got a decent credit rating, good for you. You don't need a good credit rating to live, but it does make everything a lot damn easier.

       If you're worried about RF tracking just get one of those Faraday wallet things that block the signal.  It's not like the chip is subcutaneous... yet.

       As for the people saying you don't need credit... how the heck do you people get a mortgage without credit?

       We are a biotech firm focused on serving the needs of the biohacking and cybernetic upgrade community through development of implantable RFID systems and the cultivation of access to competent service providers. We are the first of our kind, I comment to say, unequivocally, that we do not advise users of RFID implants to associate their implant, or program them with credit cards, currency, or medical information, or sensitive information of any sort. This video and the movie it previews prey on fear that has been drilled into people. It is the product of an unhealthy culture, and an insult to progress. The user of an implantable RFID device has complete autonomy of the device's function, and is free to remove or upgrade the device at any time with minimal risk or complexity. This post, and the movie: Rumors of Wars, are steps backward, and do not reflect the reality of the technology as it exists.

       The masters of Human Chattle need not brand or tag their property, they know where it is, and what it is doing at all times, this is done efficiently and inexpensively through the use of digital instrumentation and software. It is much cheaper, safer, and more effective to surveil by merely taking a photograph with the tools available today than it is to wrestle someone to the ground and stuff a chip in their hand.

       With satellite, wifi, and cell technology; there is no where to hide, regardless of how few credit cards, or cell phones you have, you can and will be found and analyzed if the need is seen. When you understand and fully accept this as a fact of reality in this part of the 21st century, you are free to let go of the fears you have. 
Like others have said, Faraday wallets are effective for securing RFID Credit Cards. The same holds true for RFID implants; a thin film of almost any metal will make it functionally impossible to read the implant. The reality of the technology and the physics of its function at the dimensions used by implantable RFID technology also greatly limit their range, to less than 10mm; remote, or clandestine interrogation of a tag is not possible, by decree of the laws of physics. Take a breath, calm down, and keep searching.
