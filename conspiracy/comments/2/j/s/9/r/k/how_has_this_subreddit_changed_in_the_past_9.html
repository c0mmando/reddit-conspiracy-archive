       Just so you know posts are hit or miss all the time all over reddit.  You can see this very easily if you head over to an active news sub. and sit in the new section for a while. You will see one or two posts make it to that subs front page while dozens of other posts about the same thing get down voted to hell.

       Isn't this answering your own post?
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually don't think downvoting previously posted stuff is the best idea. There is actually very little, if any original content posted here. The closest thing would be some "self.conspiracy" posts that come up here and there. Technically almost everything here is a repost one form or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think there is more brigading and vote manipulating going on now than there was before which is why the "new" queue is so important to keep an eye on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do notice the main (hot) queue has been better lately on keeping too much ebola from getting on there as far as I can tell.

      <p>
       Of the two links I provided, what content could've be used for character assassination or doxxing? - I don't recall any sensitive information disclosed there.

      <p>
       Perhaps that's a reasonable criticism of the quality of content you post as opposed to an unreasonable attack on your character?

        Can I ask what this has to do with anything, and why you have taken such an interest in what I delete?

      <p>
       Because I notice when someone deletes their question or submission mere hours after I respond to it, and that irritates me.

       The word you used was reporting, not flagging. The comment may be deleted but my memory is not senile. Also it was several links you claimed to have reported, not A link - Plural.

        It makes me look like some kind of crazy asshole, when in reality, I was testing the claim (I think it was you who said this) that flagging a link makes it disappear.

      <p>
       Reporting, not flagging. But yes, that is correct. I opposed your testing because reporting should be made for legitimate reasons, not for mere tests.

      <p>
       However is it a character assassination if it's true?

        But in general, if I post to worldnews, politics, etc, and my comment gains traction, all it takes is one dickhead to check my history and say "check this guy's history, he's a conspiratard," and suddenly my comments are buried. Unfortunately, that is common.

      <p>
       I get accused of being a conspiratard / shill somewhat frequently, should I delete lots of my own comments?

       Sure, but you are obviously concerned with the way this subreddit has changed.  I think you're missing the point of Reddit.  Reddit is about change.  GLP is not.  If you want things to stay the same, create an account at GLP and you'll be much happier

       Sure it is. By merely linking to a subreddit and speaking ill of it, you could be interpreted as inviting brigades to the sub as a whole.

       When people brigade, do you really think they stick to a linked thread and don't explore other submissions?

       Did you not read my post? This is what I've noticed from my time spent on these boards. I'm not writing a thesis here, I don't need to provide proof. Why do you think I would have a bunch of proof of this gathered and ready to present to you anyways? I wasn't even commenting on the voting on this topic, just the issue of chemtrails and their response here in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemtrails is often used alongside "joos" and other stupid sarcastic memes conspiratards like to trot around.

      <p>
       EDIT: And this is extra funny considering I just refreshed this page and all of the usual suspects are here being negative as usual.

       You know what's worse? Those accounts that only take off eight hours or less from posting and commenting. I've been mulling over the idea of creating a database of the most frequent posters along with frequency of posts/comments and possibly the subject matter they seem to favor. There are definite patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this information wouldn't be used for anything other than personal knowledge and not to make attacks against said individuals.

       People don't really follow reddiquette. Your post was very relevant to conspiracy theorists. Yet, if it's a repost or just old information, a lot of people hate those and downvote. That's my reasoning for your situation, at least.
