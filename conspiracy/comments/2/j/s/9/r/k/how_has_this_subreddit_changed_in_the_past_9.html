<p>I actually don&#39;t think downvoting previously posted stuff is the best idea. There is actually very little, if any original content posted here. The closest thing would be some &quot;self.conspiracy&quot; posts that come up here and there. Technically almost everything here is a repost one form or another. </p>

<p>I do think there is more brigading and vote manipulating going on now than there was before which is why the &quot;new&quot; queue is so important to keep an eye on. </p>

<p>I do notice the main (hot) queue has been better lately on keeping too much ebola from getting on there as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>I frequently go through and delete a bunch of stuff that the average redditor could use for character assassination/doxxing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of the two links I provided, what content could&#39;ve be used for character assassination or doxxing? - I don&#39;t recall any sensitive information disclosed there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s really easy to go through my history and discredit whatever I may have said by finding a post that most people would consider crazy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps that&#39;s a reasonable criticism of the quality of content you post as opposed to an unreasonable attack on your character? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can I ask what this has to do with anything, and why you have taken such an interest in what I delete?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I notice when someone deletes their question or submission mere hours after I respond to it, and that irritates me. </p>

<p>The reason I deleted those was because it was obvious you would use the comments for character assassination, as you&#39;re doing right now</p>

<p>Except they didn&#39;t contain any information useful for character assassination.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re accusing me of character assassination by claiming you delete your own posts... Then you&#39;ve merely contributed towards that fact by deleting your posts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I realized I shouldn&#39;t have admitted to flagging a link in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word you used was reporting, not flagging. The comment may be deleted but my memory is not senile. Also it was several links you claimed to have reported, not A link - Plural. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes me look like some kind of crazy asshole, when in reality, I was testing the claim (I think it was you who said this) that flagging a link makes it disappear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reporting, not flagging. But yes, that is correct. I opposed your testing because reporting should be made for legitimate reasons, not for mere tests. </p>

<p>However is it a character assassination if it&#39;s true?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But in general, if I post to worldnews, politics, etc, and my comment gains traction, all it takes is one dickhead to check my history and say &quot;check this guy&#39;s history, he&#39;s a conspiratard,&quot; and suddenly my comments are buried. Unfortunately, that is common.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get accused of being a conspiratard / shill somewhat frequently, should I delete lots of my own comments? </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have 7-10 crossposts on the front page every day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Crossposting =/= vote brigading. If it does then the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2js6mu/well_it_happened_again_israeli_settler_runs_over/">current #5 post</a> is a vote brigade - But given the context, it kinda does in fact sound like one... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t vote brigade, so why would you insinuate that I&#39;m being hypocritical?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s called generalising - A very handy thing to do when referring to a group of people, like a subreddit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, I see one crosspost on our front page to a submission that was removed, meaning a brigade isn&#39;t even possible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure it is. By merely linking to a subreddit and speaking ill of it, you could be interpreted as inviting brigades to the sub as a whole. </p>

<p>When people brigade, do you really think they stick to a linked thread and don&#39;t explore other submissions? </p>

<p>if we had a bunch of crossposts on the front page and didn&#39;t use .np, I would agree with you</p>

<p>I use RES, which is super convenient for all kinds of things but one little thing it does is have a notice pop up for when i&#39;m in a .np link. </p>

<p>If I so desired I could just remove the .np from the url and do whatever. </p>

<p>The .np isn&#39;t some kind of saving grace. It&#39;s more of a mild inconvenience to the average troll. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The trolls in that sub are reminded several times a day to use .np and still decide not to. Why? It&#39;s because they want to vote brigade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d attribute that more to laziness/forgetfulness than anything else. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Read about .np <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/wiki/intro">here</a> and you&#39;ll learn that it doesn&#39;t actually do anything other than indicate to people they shouldn&#39;t vote. </p>

<p>Even if by the grace of god a user gets banned for their blatant brigading, it takes 30 seconds to create a new account. </p>

<p>Did you not read my post? This is what I&#39;ve noticed from my time spent on these boards. I&#39;m not writing a thesis here, I don&#39;t need to provide proof. Why do you think I would have a bunch of proof of this gathered and ready to present to you anyways? I wasn&#39;t even commenting on the voting on this topic, just the issue of chemtrails and their response here in general.</p>

<p>Chemtrails is often used alongside &quot;joos&quot; and other stupid sarcastic memes conspiratards like to trot around.</p>

<p>EDIT: And this is extra funny considering I just refreshed this page and all of the usual suspects are here being negative as usual.</p>
