        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, let me say that this will probably set off red flags in your head immediately, but I hope that you take the time to investigate these claims, because it is of my opinion that they can stand up to intense pressure. The math is written, and it works. </p>

<p>In abstract terms, Nassim has a theory and math to explain quantum gravity - however the implications from his research are entirely more important than the above claim.</p>

<p>Nassim calculates the rest mass of the proton using current models for the proton charge radius, and comes within .072% of the estimated rest mass - among other insanely accurate deductions using algebra alone (e.g. estimated particles in the universe, the strong force, the gravitational constant, among others). The equation is a simple generalized holographic principle equation.</p>

<p>Namely, though holographic principles - Nassim proves that all organized matter (be it a proton, a star, or a galaxy, etc) can be defined in terms of the Swarzschild condition - meaning they contain a black hole (or what Nassim calls black WHoles - due to the inwards/outwards flow of the torus structure he uses as the fundamental geometric flow of energy e.g. gravitation inwards, electromagnetism outwards). </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/BlfsswC.png">Scaling law graph implicating black holes at all scales</a></p>

<p>Here is the paper on the above, co-written with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Rauscher">Elizabeth Rauscher</a> - with hundreds of peer reviewed papers, not to mention working for NASA. </p>

<p><a href="http://hiup.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/scalinglaw_paper.pdf">Universal Scaling Law</a></p>

<p>The major ringer here - is that all of these systems singularities are one singularity. They are holographically represented in all singularities, but at the core - the singularity is one infinite energy, superfluid medium, that all matter is interacting with, all the time. (This is the only interpretation of a singularity that gives the word any meaning to begin with). This explains quantum entanglement, as there really is no space in between any quanta in the vacuum singularity.</p>

<p>The mass of such a singularity before it is distributed to all protons is the exact mass to yield strong force, and after it is distributed between protons/planck units in the proton yields the exact mass for gravity.  </p>

<p>When we see stars, or any other medium with these singularities, we are viewing them outside of their event horizons, at a point of balance.</p>

<p>Here is his latest paper, <a href="http://resonance.is/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1367405491-Haramein342013PRRI3363.pdf">Quantum Gravity and the Holographic Mass</a> - that is the theory in it&#39;s entirety. </p>

<p>Some open peer review <a href="http://www.sciencedomain.org/review-history.php?iid=224&amp;id=4&amp;aid=1298">here</a></p>

<p>To get to more woo - the holographic approach he utilizes means that planck units tile on the surface of event horizons, in a flower of life geometric relationship. The flower of life is a 2d representation of the geometry of the vacuum. (overlapping planck spherical units)</p>

<p>I hope this pique&#39;s your interest enough to look passed the instant dismissal of many physicists of his theory - and that you will put the pressure on it - until it gives way or confirms his thoughts. If it is true (it took me months to take it all in) the implications are enormous (a connected universe, non-locality, ancient cultures having incredible knowledge, clean energy by utilizing the vacuum energy, etc).</p>

<p>Here is a documentary that explains it all very very nicely. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of <em>some</em> of the impossible math. This is deriving the strong force interaction time and a correlated nuclear emission rate by simply calculating two Swarzschild protons orbital periods. Note, protons do not orbit anything in the standard model. The standard model also has a non-mechanical explanation for the strong force - a particle called the gluon that was plugged into equations just like dark energy to satisfy the equations and come up with a brand new force, that&#39;s never been directly observed (gluons).</p>

<p>It&#39;s dismissed without deep look - they all reference BobAThon&#39;s article called Fraud or Sage (2nd result for Nassim Haramein) however Bob&#39;s concerns are incorrect <em>and</em> answered by Nassim - for example his first is dismissing the mass of the Swarzschild proton as being too massive  - however he doesn&#39;t take into account the holographic principle at all, which is the basis of the theory and the subject of the paper. Most people google Nassim and stop after that. RationalWiki pretty much uses this as it&#39;s sole ammunition against Nassim - along with a ton of Ad Hominem&#39;s. They don&#39;t even understand the theory, honestly. </p>

<p>I hate to say this because physics is supposed to be the cleanest, least influenced, most pure science, however - it&#39;s been shown throughout history, every time a new world-view is portrayed (earth is not the center of the universe, stars are suns, etc) it&#39;s dismissed and the person is labeled a crackpot. It&#39;s a problem of human beings and hive-mind, not the scientific method - and it hasn&#39;t gone away.</p>

<p>You need to investigate why someone has been dismissed by his peers. Sure, he claims to be a groundbreaking scientist making profound discoveries using basic math and common sense, but that&#39;s because doing real math research, having it peer reviewed, and writing up your findings in clear, concise, and rigorous (disprovable) way is difficult and doesn&#39;t pay particularly well. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not willing to dismiss him, because I haven&#39;t had time to read and critique his work. However, I am willing to forego that process because some of my peers have reviewed his work and found that it does not hold up to scrutiny. Not pedantic scrutiny either, they claim his basic premises are flawed.</p>

<p>Another example of ground breaking attempts was Garret Lisi&#39;s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;ei=YspFVJ_aFeGIiwK2xIGADg&amp;amp;url=http://www.ted.com/talks/garrett_lisi_on_his_theory_of_everything%3Flanguage%3Den&amp;amp;ved=0CCAQyCkwAA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGTJu1bNVK_UPzNRk412FQBFizKUw">exceptionally simple theory of everything</a>
, which attempted to provide a grand unified theory of physics, after years and years of hard work, and barely failed to do so, much to the chagrin of mathematicians and physicists everywhere. Most of us expected him to be the next Einstein.</p>

<p>There is far less conspiracy in the hard sciences than this subreddit had a tendency to believe. As a student and aspiring scholar, I am well aware that the subject matter seems esoteric and is obscured from most of the populations comprehension. This is largely due to the accessibility of higher education in capitalist countries. However, the sheer volume of complicit individuals that would have to participate in a conspiracy in the sciences would be illogical. This is especially true considering that everyone&#39;s work is published.</p>

<p>Hold to your beliefs if you will, but don&#39;t be so hasty to assume there is a massive conspiracy in the sciences. Most of us only want to learn and share our knowledge, progress the human race, improve the lives of our fellow men, and have dedicated our lives to the pursuit of truth. We are natural skeptics and critics. And if one of us were wrong, there would be no shortage of accolades for any individual capable of demonstrating this.</p>

<p>Engineers on the other hand... Lol</p>

<p>Just a personal rant. I lurk here sometimes, and this sub is so quick to assume scientists are pulling a fast one on everyone else. It&#39;s discouraging, but that&#39;s why I posted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pressure to conform is not a conspiracy.  Many people refuse to accept or even consider any idea or thought that falls outside of accepted, orthodox thought.  This goes double for those whose entire social, economic, and psychological worth is based on the infallibility of said orthodoxy.  It doesn&#39;t take a secret cabal of scientists plotting to ignore and subvert new theories that don&#39;t jive with theirs.  All it takes is a bunch of self aggrandized jackasses sitting in an ivory tower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always enjoyed the work of Nassim, it&#39;s so immensely interesting &amp; the ties to ancient lost knowledge to myself is unquestionable. Are you familiar with Thomas Kuhn? He wrote The Structure of Scientific Revolutions back in the 60s. Although not on the topic of what Nassim discusses, it may give some light into why his views are so widely criticized. Kuhn really upset the scientific community with his views &amp; I feel we are well over due for another scientific revolution. But his arguments appear sound in describing the overall structure of the world of scientific study. 
   Just as a little personal complaint I see all the time, whenever I see someone post &quot;because science&quot;, to me it sounds the same as &quot;because said established religion&quot;. If you review some of Kuhns arguments you&#39;ll see where my view stems from.
Cheers. Keep questioning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very likely possible that people at the level of understanding required for the math can and will dispute it. Not because it&#39;s wrong.. but because focusing entirely on the nomenclature to give a whole understanding and experience of this knowledge will continue to fail.</p>

<p>What much of the scientific bureaucracy perceives as objective evidence is in fact a subjective group consensus. Why does this matter? It matters because you need to experience the objective truth objectively. Objectivity resides in the reality you are describing. Not in the material subjective experience. You cannot <strong>subjectively</strong> experience the interconnectedness and eternal nature of Reality. </p>

<p>When you suggest ancient cultures had access to this profound knowledge you are correct. And so do people right now. Modern bureaucratic science relies heavily on subjectivity and subjective tools like telescopes and microscopes that enhance a subjective sense like sight (as an example). But we have an &#39;ancient&#39; science of introspection/meditation that presents an objective tool which offers (the possibility of) a DIRECT experience of the true nature of Reality. The &quot;illusion&quot; of the material world, the truth of the underlying singularity, eternity. </p>

<p>No one can make someone meditate or present someone with undeniable objective truth. It&#39;s the folly of math and science. The truth has to be experienced. Ultimately the people who are developing the science and the math are the one&#39;s that are benefiting most from it in that it is a practice not unlike meditating. It is a mental exercise that produces profound experiences of truth. But.. if you aren&#39;t directly pursuing those experiences through the mental exercise of the math, more so just consuming someone else&#39;s experience second hand, you are likely better off meditating. There are 100s and 100s of years of research done and doesn&#39;t require a stale nomenclature or any language that can be expressed subjectively. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people on reddit who have taken the time to explain to you, in a point by point fashion, the mistakes in the hypothesis, or why the notable results aren&#39;t all that notable.

What I see from you, on the other hand, is continual dismissal of their deconstructions, or you just simply moving onto another point, seldom acknowledging the discrepancies.</p>

<p>To be honest, I&#39;m just kind of sick of seeing this stuff on all the subreddits that I frequent.

<p>not at all. everything in the universe is connected in space-time by the virute of a common origin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in this theory, that common origin is still ever-present, matter is simply the framework-shadow that comes out of the energy and structure of the vacuum structure of space, what you&#39;re referring to as a common origin.</p>

<p>It&#39;s insignificant because it is the pull of the vacuum after it is distributed across all planck spherical units in a proton (the planck units are representative of one proton, e.g. each are like quantum tunnels to every proton.)</p>

<p><strong>Solving for quantum gravity</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental structure of space-time is a quantized infinite scalar lattice geometry in the pattern of The Flower of Life. In other words, space itself is made of discrete super tiny tiny tiny packets of energy: the smallest little vibration that the electromagnetic spectrum does. These tiny packets are what you could think of as the &quot;pixels&quot; that make up the universe and since they are not square, but spherical, they are actually called &quot;voxels&quot; that organize in a 3D flower of life perfect sphere-packing geometry.</p>

<p>First discovered by Max Planck, the smallest distance you can possibly measure is the length of this universal fundamental wave-from called the Planck length: 0.0000000000000000000000000000000001616cm
(10 to the -33cm)</p>

<p>It is nearly impossible to visualize how small the Planck length is. However if you picture a little dot that is .1mm (or about the smallest thing the unaided human eye can see) and blew up that little dot like a balloon to the size of the observable universe, the Planck would then be about a .1mm dot in that universe. Or in other words, that original .1mm dot is about 1/2 way in scale between the size of the observable universe and the Plank!</p>

<p>Nassim Haramein calls these tiny energy packets Planck Spherical Units (PSU) because they are spherical, like most other structures the universe creates at all scales. These spherical waveforms overlap and perfectly pack together to form the 3D flower of life structure of space itself.</p>

<p>Using these universal voxels, Nassim calculates how many of them fit on the inside of a proton volume compared to how many are present on the outside surface area of the proton (or any black hole). This ratio, a geometric relationship, is the gravitational field!</p>

<p>Gravity is essentially a ratio of information on the inside to information on the surface of black holes in a holofractographic space-time manifold.</p>

<p>Nassim has discovered a discreet, quantized, pixelated (voxelated) way of describing gravity in which all you need to do is essentially count these little Planck Spherical Units without having to use highly complex tensor equations normally needed to solve Albert Einstein&#39;s field equations. You could place a flower of life tiling pattern around the Earth and the same geometric ratio would yield the gravitational field you are feeling right now as you read this!</p>

<p>A geometric solution for gravity.</p>

<p>The irony of it all is that this solution has been right under our noses this whole time thanks to many ancient cultures encoding this geometric relationship right into their monuments and documents in the form of the flower of life symbol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://vacuumsingularity.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/holo-flower-2.jpg?w=425&amp;amp;h=398">This picture will help you visualize the internal planck spherical units and the tesselating, holographic planck circles.</a></p>

<p><strong>More specific calculations</strong></p>

<p><strong>Holographic Gravity</strong></p>

<p>The Planck circles naturally distributes across the surface area of the proton horizon in such a way that they are space-filling, like the PSU’s inside the proton, creating an holographic interference pattern often called “the Flower of Life”. Now that we’re equipped with the basic structure of the proton and its relation to the quantum vacuum we may proceed to calculate essential facts about our universe.</p>

<p>We begin using our renormalized value for the vacuum density (5,1×10<sup>93</sup> gm/cm3) to derive the mass/energy available within the volume of a proton sphere; the resulting answer is 4,9×10<sup>55</sup> grams. Using the renormalized vacuum density of 10<sup>93</sup> gm per cubic centimeter, 10<sup>55</sup> gm is how much vacuum energy is permitted within the tiny proton volume.</p>

<p>We proceed by dividing the total surface area of the proton horizon by the holographic Planck circles, to learn that the proton horizon is covered by 4,72×10<sup>40</sup> intersecting equatorial circles forming the interference pattern mentioned above.</p>

<p>Now we divide 4,72×10<sup>40</sup> with 10<sup>55</sup> - that is, the number of Planck circles on the proton surface with the number of PSU’s within the proton volume – receiving the result of 5,91×10<sup>14</sup> – the exact gravitational mass needed for the proton to obey the Schwarzschild condition generating a black hole!</p>

<p>(This mass is extremely large, and for a reason. This is the mass of the totality, inside the event horizon, before it is distributed to all other protons yielding the exact standard mass of the proton).</p>

<p>Now we have derived the holographic gravitational mass of the proton (its Schwarzschild mass) from Planck units and geometry alone, without involving the Schwarzschild equation or the gravitational equations of Einstein’s general relativity at any point. Thus Gravity has been described as a ratio of mass/information to surface area and has been accounted for completely in algebraic terms without involving space-time curvature, only through pixelation of the structure of the vacuum itself. For the first time we have mathematical proof and a functioning description of Quantum Gravity!</p>

<p><strong>Finding the Standard Proton</strong></p>

<p>We have seen how the proton achieves its holographic gravitational mass due to vacuum fluctuations within the proton volume, now we need to find its measured value when viewed from outside its horizon. This brings us to a deeper understanding of the proton wherein its quantum entanglement to all other protons is revealed.</p>

<p>The internal volume of the proton relates to its surface geometry in such a way that one PSU holographically expresses all energy/information entangled with it. If we divide the circular surface tessellations (4,72×10<sup>40)</sup> with the volume of the proton itself (10<sup>-39</sup> ) the result comes out 1,67×10<sup>79</sup> – which is the currently estimated number of particles in the universe. The result reveals a quantum entanglement through mini-wormholes with all other protons in our universe; every single Planck circle at the proton surface can be understood as a mini-wormhole internally connecting it with another proton.</p>

<p>To find the actual expressed mass of a single proton in this worm-hole matrix we must map the mass influence of one proton on a single Planck circle. We do this by dividing the Schwarzschild mass of the proton by the number of protons in the universe, which gives us 10<sup>-65</sup> (this number equals the proton mass distributed into all other protons). Then we multiply this number with the number of Planck circles on the proton surface, namely 4,72×10<sup>40,</sup> to reveal the mass influence by one single proton – one tiny wormhole connection. The result is 1,672295215 x 10<sup>-24,</sup> which is the proven Standard mass of the proton! </p>

<p>Simple holographic principles. Information can be encoded on a 2d surface (the proton event horizon) that encodes the volumetric information contained in planck spherical units.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take it from me - here&#39;s the equations:</p>

<p>(Notice, this is and older deriviation with an older proton radius, there is an addendum where a new proton radius is used (from Paul Scherrer institute) that gives a much closer result for the proton mass.</p>

<p>As for gravity, there&#39;s no interaction at the subatomic level. the electroweak and strong nuclear forces are orders of magnitude more dominant.</p>

<p>The strong nuclear force <strong>has the same source</strong> as gravitation. It is simply the force distributed. It&#39;s mechanical in nature, not magical (gluons).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a depiction of the geometry:

<p>there is a correspondance between the surface area and information content, and the universe can be treated as a hologram.. well partly so anyway. </p>

<p>what that has to do with gravity, an inertial force, eludes me.   if you can derive  F = Gm1m2/r<sup>2</sup> and the universal gravitational constant from this theory, then you might sell me.  until then, I&#39;m satisfied it&#39;s all explained by inertial force.</p>

<p>Just imagine the doors it will open if someone can prove that a shape like the flower of life represents an important part of our existence. It will instantly give credence to all of those people studying alternative archaeology/history.</p>

<p>My understanding of quantum physics is basic at best, but using the power of technology, I was able to follow what he was trying to say.

    <div class="md"><p>What? Every doc and book on quantum physics I&#39;ve ever read says that gravitational equations (in their present form) simply do not work with quantum field equations. There is a fundamental incompatibility and to the best of my knowledge, it&#39;s the holy grail of physics to find some way of harmonizing them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying what you said is wrong, but our mathematical models of reality are what need to be &quot;unified&quot;.... if not tossed out and started fresh.</p>
