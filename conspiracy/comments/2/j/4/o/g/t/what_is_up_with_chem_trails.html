       So yesterday something really weird happened over my town and the surrounding counties and cities. The entire day was nice out and sunny about 55 degrees. And around 4 o'clock I was cursing down a locks high way to see these really odd flight patterns in the sky. There were x's squares random trails just about everywhere in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to about a half hour later, at this point the trails started spreading really far out creating what looed like formations of clouds. Within the next 2 hours the sky had gone from sunny and minimum clouds to pitch dark. Literally everywhere. As far as you could see it was ark as could be. Other than a few patches of sky where you could actually see light. It was nice above the clouds but underneath looked like Armageddon. Wtf was going on?

       That website is ground zero for tinfoil hat wearing paranoid conspiracy theorists. By all means, soak it up - they have a very compelling tale to tell. But then balance it up by reading the non-chemical, non -conspiracy explanation

       With "Global Dimming" admitted to, how can you keep believing that the phenomenon this guy just described as accidental? He says it was a sunny day when a bunch of jets started making criss-cross patterns and then it went dark. The flight patterns are unexplainable as "persistent contrails". Why would so many jets be crossing paths at the same time? That's intentional.

       What OP relates describes classic contrail conditions - an approaching cold wet front.

       So in that picture we can see the beginning and the end of the contrail. You are telling me that this was formed because the plane passed through a "wet cold front".
      </p>
      <p>
       And this contrail that turns on and then off:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfhEtAH0sYA
       </a>
       . This is because the plane is passing through air that is colder where the contrail is? Just want to be clear on what you are saying here.

       It is possible to see Banding' in clouds. It happens a lot. We even call some of them Mackerel clouds'. This Marble Cake effect can happen in air which is clear, but only shows when an aircraft passes through it. So yes, it's the aircraft passing through alternate wet and dry regions.

       I like to have an open mind. But I am indeed a conspiracy theorist. Although you have given more info I think feoengonerring most certianly is occurring as we speak, and in a way that is going to destroy the human civilization in time.

       There is an international ban on geoengineering with an exemption for local cloudbusting and 'Experiments', so the military are probably doing all sorts of things to the upper atmosphere. But it's all small scale because there isn't a delivery system able to lift more than a few hundred kilos into the stratosphere. Geoengineering is not responsible for the c-trails in the troposphere.

       I live in western Kentucky. I have been noticing several things going on near the Tennessee border to Metropolis, IL (Yes, the home of Superman). This may just sound like crazy talk, but I've spent a lot of time observing the sky both day and night. If anyone in the area would like to see these oddities, msg me. The below events were witnessed by myself and those with me on different dates. Some are one time events. Others are normal.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Rainbow colored clouds. I saw two small cumulus clouds among dozens that displayed the light spectrum/prism phenomenon. This was just a few days ago. Zero rain or signs of rain were evident. I noticed this after it was pointed out by a friend. If typical rainbows could be described as an arch seen as red facing up and violet down, these were red/east/ and violet/west. It was about 3-4 pm CST.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Songbirds flying thru clouds and other daily observations that defy the textbooks regarding cloud altitude.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Triangle clouds. I think this may be a HAARP phenomenon, after considering the formations in water after exposed to a vibrating wave source. The purplish hue associated with HAARP could be seen on the horizon. This went on for several weeks, sometimes alternating with disc shapes. That may or may not be significant.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cobb web clouds, almost ghostly in appearance often linger or even seem attracted to one another at times. I have seen them touch the ground in Metropolis. They are especially low.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Using binoculars I have seen large 747 or 757, dust croppers, and even drones over the area. One drone (ufo) was white, with a black stripe, and pill shaped. I reported this to MUFON some time back. It did not have any visible motor/engine or wings. I've also seen one particular jet spray something bright white which pulled cob web type clouds into cumulus clouds.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I have seen metal, foil-like confetti rain from clouds. These pieces seem to be about 3-6" in length and width, but scale is a tough thing to gauge. I can say that these things turn to particulates by the time they hit the ground. I watched my neighbors get rained on while in their pool. They had no clue.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Purple night sky. Clear night, cloudy night, full moon, new moon, street lights, and no lights have all yielded this same oddity. That lasted for over 30 days, but I haven't seen it in weeks.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         South winds. After 30+ years of the majority of wind and rain coming from the north, the opposite has been true for at least six months.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This one may get me a visit, but I've seen a two very large dark or cloaked triangle shaped craft wrangle clouds - like cowboys wrangle cattle - and make all of them disappear. They displayed the typical lights described by UFO witnesses. The clouds were backlit by a full moon, and the one craft hovered directly over a friends house. It took 10 minutes total. I could taste metal on my tongue, and my lips felt slightly numb. The person with me also described those sensations.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I could say more, but I'll just stop while I still sound somewhat sane. I only want to mention all the cellphone towers that appeared overnight, and my gut feeling that its all related somehow. Maybe ELF or GWEN? If you live in this area, I can most certainly show you UFO and geoengineering phenomenon.

       Persistent contrails require specific weather conditions in regards to temperature and relative humidity. Cooler, crisper days are more conducive to contrails.

       Chemtrails certainly exist in the form of cloud seeding and and solar radiation management experimentation.  MAYBE there are even programs to spray heavy metals to make you stupid (however unlikely). But chances are that what you saw were contrails.

       Don't contrails dissipate though? I have seen contrails before and after some time they are gone, but chemtrails seem to linger in the air for quite some time.

       Contrails drift over time, forming what appears as grid patterns. They linger for extended periods of time in air that is supersaturated with moisture.
