        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A friend of mine just gave me a call kind of losing his shit. He claims that FEMA has been buying up tons of supplies here in Florida. Everything from MREs to medical supplies.</p>

<p>He also claims that a friend of his that has ~10 acres of farm land just had all of his crops bought by FEMA for double the price. </p>

<p>Has anyone heard anything about this or have some insight?</p>

<p>He&#39;s making a connection to an ebola outbreak. I tend to think that it may just be the beginning of October and the start of the new federal fiscal year and FEMA is just making all of their supplies purchases. I haven&#39;t been able to find any news on the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s due to the fact that they are buying so many supplies and items while this &quot;ebola&quot; scare is gaining traction. It causes people to think that something may happen here in America and that FEMA is just getting what they need for the coming up event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How would your friend know that FEMA is buying up supplies? Ask him where he is getting his sources from and study those. You can start googling for information. Look at the FEMA website and there is a section for business solicitations. Also google FedBizOps and start digging through solicitations by state. Also google FEMA purchase orders. As far as someone having their land purchased for twice the price, I am highly suspect of that. Again google FEMA purchasing land and look into it. Let us know what you find after you research it and please post relevant links. Edit- just reread your post and saw you said the land itself wasn&#39;t purchased but the crops were. What were the crops purchased? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the direction.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very skeptical of what he had told me, especially given that he kept dodging my questions about his sources.
I had tired finding some information with no luck. I&#39;ll try what you mentioned and post back.</p>

<p>Edit: About why he may potentially know, he&#39;s a physician and he was buying supplies for his practice and he claimed they were out of stock of some normally readily available items. Wether or not his vendor claimed FEMA was the cause, no idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far to date all of their purchases have been on the books. Everything from coffin liners to bullets, hazmat suits in huge quantities, vaccines and anything in between. Like I mentioned in my comment, the details that matter are in the fine print of the contracts. An example being a solicitation for ________ (fill in the blank) where a company/corporation/manufacturer must deliver X amount of solicited goods to multiple cities and states in an ongoing contract and also be able to fulfill a huge order on demand in addition to the original solicitation. Those are solicited items to follow closely. </p>

<p>This may have slipped by you in January of this year. FEMA Seeks BioMedical Disposal Capability To Support 1,000 TENT HOSPITALS, On 24 Hours Notice</p>

<p>And here is one the solicitation on their website. Pay attention to the contract details in this particular solicitation. </p>

<p>FEMA intends to establish an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with one or more contractor(s) for a base period of 1-year plus four twelve-month option periods. Large and Small Businesses are welcome to respond. The contractor(s) must be available and capable of meeting FEMA&#39;s emergency response task orders for delivering 40-yard size dumpsters with waste removing services and establishing bio-medical hazard waste removal services within time requirements, throughout the full duration of the contract.
Contractor(s) will have the choice to submit a proposal for dumpster service only, bio-medical waste removal service only or both dumpster and bio-medical waste removal services. </p>

<p>Most of these were posted late in 2013. They are not all &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; per say. But the fine print in the contract is to be scrutinized along with delivery dates and locations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Executive Order Gives Obama control of all &quot;resources&quot; during times of &quot;crisis.&quot; Now we know why: Ebola!</p>

<p><a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/sean-hannity/2012/03/20/real-obama-absolute-power">http://nation.foxnews.com/sean-hannity/2012/03/20/real-obama-absolute-power</a></p>

<p>The order essentially gives the president of the United States absolute power over any and all American resources during both times of peace and national crisis. Now, this includes, but it&#39;s not limited to food and livestock, water, plants, energy, health resources, transportation and construction materials and gives the government the ability to, quote, &quot;control the general distribution of any material, including applicable services in this civilian market.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this says nothing about &quot;taking resources&quot;. This executive order removed these sections from a previously used Reagan executive order that designated Interpol as an International Organization:</p>

<p>• Section 2(c), which provided officials immunity from their property and assets being searched and confiscated; including their archives; 
• the portions of Section 2(d) and Section 3 relating to customs duties and federal internal-revenue importation taxes; 
• Section 4, dealing with federal taxes; 
• Section 5, dealing with Social Security; and 
• Section 6, dealing with property taxes.</p>

<p>I guess section 2(c) is kind of scary, but it&#39;s the same rights extended to the  Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission... Your friend in the link is worried that Interpol is going to be Obama&#39;s foreign gestapo, despite the fact that there&#39;s only a staff of ~700 people for Interpol...  </p>
