        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">72</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-10-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/jzuspiece.html">jzuspiece</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> There is a pattern indicative of bias in moderation by certain moderators at r/worldnews.</p>

<p><strong>Test:</strong> Do you have examples of this bias? Please post your analysis - or cases you notice (especially if you have information about the mods involved) at <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/isrworldnewsbiased/">http://np.reddit.com/r/isrworldnewsbiased/</a></p>

<p>In the past two days, I&#39;ve seen three articles, several with karma in the 3 digit range, get removed. The recurring theme in each of those articles? They all brought up Israel - and they all did so in a not-so-positive light. I&#39;ve never seen the moderation team act so swiftly and I must commend them for staying ever-vigilant. At the same time, it&#39;s a bit troubling that articles critical of Russia, China and ISIS keep seeming to get accidentally missed by their moderation team even when the articles are from (a) baseless sources or (b) opinion pieces. It&#39;s also troubling that in spite of the vigilance of the moderation team with respect to articles that point out terrorism practiced by Israelis, that they seem to keep missing other articles that their logic for removal would apply to. I&#39;ve set out to help our friends at r/worldnews. They&#39;re probably just dropping the ball because they&#39;re super-duper busy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started the above sub to keep track of cases like this. Here are the benefits to having a sub for this purpose:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When somebody asks you why you referred them to <a href="/r/worldpolitics">/r/worldpolitics</a> when there&#39;s a default sub with over a million subscribers that even Google picks up, you can link them to <a href="/r/isrworldnewsbiased">/r/isrworldnewsbiased</a>. Rather than break it down explicitly for them, you can tell them why alt subs are healthy for the ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p>When somebody asks you why you&#39;re being a such a crazy tin-foil hat wacko and criticizing the immaculate moderation team at r/worldnews that has never done anything but uphold the principles Reddit was founded on - you can again direct them to the above sub which ought to be completely empty as a demonstration of how fair the moderation team at r/worldnews is.</p></li>
<li><p>When you (falsely) criticize r/worldnews and somebody accuses you of using an isolated example to cast doubt on the credibility of the mods at r/worldnews and their commitment to the free flow of information - you can also link them to the above sub rather than digging for other (false) pieces of evidence.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>...</p>

<h2>Examples of what brought this on below:</h2>

<p>Israeli Terrorists set fire to Mosque in Palestine (removed under the pretense of being in the wrong sub, should be in the country-specific subs and for being &quot;local crime&quot;)</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2j8ak5/jewish_settlers_set_fire_to_mosque_in_palestinian/">http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2j8ak5/jewish_settlers_set_fire_to_mosque_in_palestinian/</a></p>

<p>Israeli Terrorists Destroy Several Palestinian Water Wells (censored under the guise of this cross border terrorism being mere &quot;local crime&quot;)</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jdng2/israeli_settlers_damage_seven_palestinian_wells/">http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jdng2/israeli_settlers_damage_seven_palestinian_wells/</a></p>

<p>Shlomo Sand Criticizes Israeli Racism and Renounces his &#39;Jewish&#39; Identity (removed for being &quot;opinion analysis&quot;)</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jfj0l/shlomo_sand_i_wish_to_resign_and_cease/">http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jfj0l/shlomo_sand_i_wish_to_resign_and_cease/</a></p>

<p>These are just some of the examples over the last few days that I&#39;ve seen. In each case, articles were removed under a few (generally about 3) hours.</p>

<p>...</p>

<h2>Meanwhile the following is r/WorldNews-worthy:</h2>

<p>Brazilian Man Kills Many People In Brazil (7 hrs to date - not censored for being a local crime)</p>

<p>An author&#39;s opinion/analysis about prison (Several days now - not censored for being opinion/analysis)</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1piwnk/prison_clearly_does_not_work_fresh_from_jail_the/">http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1piwnk/prison_clearly_does_not_work_fresh_from_jail_the/</a></p>

<p>Opinion Article Decrying Anti-Semitism (Several days now - not censored for being opinion/analysis)</p>

<p>...</p>

<h2>Here&#39;s an example of a Story not tied to Israel, that was rightly removed for being a local crime - given that this is what it was (Indian Farmer burns alive another Indian):</h2>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jezyd/a_lowcaste_teenage_boy_in_india_has_been_burnt_to/">http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jezyd/a_lowcaste_teenage_boy_in_india_has_been_burnt_to/</a></p>

<p>Notice the difference. It took them almost a full day to act on this clearly local crime story that built its way to the front page. Meanwhile, they deleted stories of open terrorism (in 2 of the cases near the top of this post) under the pretense of &#39;local crime&#39; in less than 3 hrs. The story regarding Shlomo Sand was actually removed <strong>while they left this particular story about an Indian crime up</strong> - only to take it down much later.</p>

<p>This is absolutely, categorically false. Please do not spread lies in this manner. You can and will cause other users to get shadowbanned. Ask the admins if you need further clarification please. </p>

<p>...of over 50 submissions over 500 upvotes made to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> over the last year that portray Israel is a disparaging light... with many being much more incendiary than the ones OP claims were censored for being anti-Israel. I know many of you are concerned that you think the sub is censoring content that is unfavorable to Israel, but I think this list should be sufficient evidence to convince you that sub engages in NO censorship of that particular subject.</p>

<p>Edit: also, keep in mind that this is just the 50 I could find with a quick search that were over 500 upvotes... there are probably hundreds more than I missed and that did not exceed 500 upvotes. So, while I know this one or two isolated examples OP is providing may seem like conclusive evidence to you, there is a <em>wealth</em> of evidence that demonstrates no censorship of anti-Israeli stories is occurring whatsoever on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. Straight news stories of ANY type are accepted, so long as they follow the rules of the sub. I know many are riled up over this topic, but I just wanted to provide some evidence that showed that things could actually be otherwise.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really claim anything in this thread. I proposed a well-known hypothesis, and presented 3 examples over the last 3 days that were snubbed by your team in under 3 hours once they&#39;d reached 3 digits of karma/visibility while many other articles - that would fall under the inane removal reasoning were completely ignored.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I think this list should be sufficient evidence to convince you that sub engages in NO censorship of that particular subject.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I appreciate it, but this doesn&#39;t prove you lot aren&#39;t censoring articles. I don&#39;t expect a highly racist person with a hard-on to stalk and kill every single black guy they pass in the street. I do expect them however, given circumstances, to pull a Trayvon if they think they can get away with it.</p>

<p><strong>Almost all the stories you dug up are from the time period during the last major operation against Palestine</strong> - in fact, literally all but 1 article you posted are from over 2 months ago. You can&#39;t possibly just censor every single article about something that&#39;s being covered by every single media outlet in the Western world in some way. At the same time, now that the primary aggression has seemingly died down, any new cases of terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism by non-state actors, are summarily removed by you guys (fact evidenced in 2 of 3 cases above). Similar actions by non-state actors in other countries however are not.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s not the only thing, you guys made an extremely <strong>obvious</strong> and extremely unpopular attempt to siphon off information about the conflict while the conflict was ongoing by relegating any posts about it to a single thread. Let&#39;s not pretend that was for any other reason than to get those stories off the main page - the problematic stories for Israel that were consistently hitting 4 digits in karma/visibility. You&#39;ve been a mod for at least four months - the &quot;innovative&quot; filter concept as an alternative sprang out of how obvious your team&#39;s attempt was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To begin, I wanted to thank you for your thoughtful reply and also, I wanted to let you know that I do take your voicing of concerns seriously. I want to do my best to explain things to you in a way that reassures you that things are not as you think they are.</p>

<p>Let me explain the removals you used as examples of this &#39;censorship&#39;. Firstly, the mosque fire submission, when it was first popped up, was determined to be local news because of the fact that the fire in question was a small one and only destroyed a <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/vandals-set-fire-to-west-bank-mosque/">few rugs and books</a>, and also the fact that there was graffiti involved as well, which made the whole thing seem like a situation of local vandals causing trouble, which is not generally something that garners world attention. Therefore, when it and any similar submission were posted, they were removed. However, the next day, reports about the Palestinian PM getting involved made the situation seem more appropriate for the sub, so they were allowed after that point, as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2jcyek/palestinian_pm_hamdallah_calls_for_protection_of/">seen here</a>. This was hardly an instance of censorship. As I proved in the list provided, we have allowed plenty of stories about Israeli settler atrocities in the past. However, every single holy building vandalization in the world is not an appropriate story for the world news sub. There is a general unrest in the area with many things happening like this daily... this incident was simply part of that general unrest and unease. </p>

<p>For the second submission example you provided of the wells being damaged, it was a similar situation as for the story above, accusations from locals of settlers damaging some well-heads is part of the general unrest and unease that is plaguing the area, and does not represent a major development or international issue that would be appropriate for the sub... it is a local scuffle and, while awful, is not yet an issue of global significance. </p>

<p>As for the 3rd example you use, that is clearly an opinion piece written in the first person. No opinion pieces or op-eds of any sort of allowed in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> whatsoever. Any article written in the first person, no matter what it is about, will ALWAYS be removed.</p>

<p>So, there you go, I feel like I explained the rationale of those removals to you very well. If providing 50 HIGHLY upvoted articles to you that paint Israel in a disparaging light is NOT sufficient evidence to demonstrate that we are not censoring content of that type, then I am not really sure what evidence if ANY will convince you that we do not engage in that practice. </p>

<p>As for the examples you provided that you did NOT consider to be worthy of <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brazilian Man Kills Many People In Brazil</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...admittedly a man killing almost 40 people is something that very much could be considered an appropriate story of world interest. Mostly, local murders/rapes/robberies/etc of individual people and criminals incidents of minimal global significance are the type of local crime we normally remove.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Vatican is Installing LEDs in the Sistine Chapel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...the Sistine Chapel is one of the most famous works of art in the world. Something like this, while maybe not necessarily be hard-hitting news the whole world cares about, is relevant to many people and was of great interest to the users of the sub. We felt the submission was appropriate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saudi Arabia to Reward Good Teachers with BMWs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...while admittedly not the most relevant piece of world news, there are many times submissions which are borderline or slightly inappropriate get upvoted so fast and escape notice before a mod is able to evaluate them, we leave up simply because it would be more trouble than it would be worth to remove them. I don&#39;t remember this submission specifically, but I would guess that this is the reason it was left up. Personally, if I saw this in the new queue, I would remove it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Inflatable Sex Toy in Paris is Actually a Christmas Tree</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...similar to the above example. Got upvoted very fast. All further mentions of this story have been removed. It is not relevant to the sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Millionaire Slave Owners Penalized</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...that is very much a widely reported world news story and is appropriate for the sub. Yes, it is a local crime, but it is one that has attracted international attention and long-term coverage due to the mass issue in parts of Europe of rich people owning slaves. In many cases, a local crime story can evolve into a world news situation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>An author&#39;s opinion/analysis about prison</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...that is not an opinion/analysis piece. This is a journalist <em>covering</em> the opinions of an expert in the field. If it is a straight news article covering the opinions of an expert in the field or a globally significant player in a certain event, these are very much appropriate for the sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Opinion Article Decrying Anti-Semitism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...as far as this article, it only received 12 upvotes at all, which means it never got anywhere near the frontpage. Many times, unless a mod is literally camping out in the frontpage watching all news submissions, inappropriate low voted submissions many be entirely missed and unnoticed. That does NOT mean that it is condoned, I actually went ahead and removed this submission as &#39;not appropriate&#39;. It means that since we have 100s of submissions a day, we don&#39;t always have time to investigate submissions that never make it anywhere near the frontpage. That is unfortunate, but it is the case sometimes. It is hard enough to focus on all the posts on the frontpage, so sometimes these things will slip by. However, if they are ever pointed out to us, like you are now, we remove them.</p>

<p>As far as the story about the Low caste teenage boy being killed, it was unfortunate that it was allowed to stay up for as long as it did, especially since it was in clear violation of the rules, for being local news. Sometimes, submissions like this are made that quickly rise to the top, as I said above, and are not properly evaluated for a time. Especially if they are posted in the early hours of the US time zones, which will mean they may not get looked properly at by a senior mod by the morning. Then, once they are recognized as inappropriate, they may have already reached over 1000 upvotes, then a discussion happens amongst mods whether removing it should happen or not. In this case, we decided to remove it. We are working to have better coverage over US timezone night hours, as we hired a new batch of international mods about a month ago. However, they are still in training and are only just now getting to the point where they can approve/remove submissions. This should help issues like this out a lot.</p>

<p>As far as your statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost all the stories you dug up are from the time period during the last major operation against Palestine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...I am not sure what that has to do with anything. Articles which are disparaging to Israel are something that users have been posting to this sub ever since it existed. Yes, of course there were more during the recent conflict, but that really proves nothing. Furthermore, you claim the examples you used above of the removed articles were &#39;<em>terrorism</em>&#39;? None of the articles about those situations classify those issues as cases of terrorism. They have been described as vandalism thru and thru with all the coverage I have seen. It is a massive distortion of the truth to call these incidents &quot;<em>cross-border terrorism by non-state actors</em>&#39;. I described to you the reasons they were removed above, because they were not, at their initial reportings, considered to be of global relevance. However, like I said, many stories evolve over time TO BE.</p>

<p>...so hopefully thru this explanation, I have sufficiently demonstrated to you the error in your thinking. I feel like I have been MORE than forthcomming and willing to provide you evidence and explanations of everything you brought to the table. You won&#39;t find any other mods of any other subs doing that. I mean really, think about it. We are about 20 mods from all over the world. Do you really think that we could carry on sub a blatant and obvious censorship without any of the mods saying anything? If we were 1 or 2 mods, maybe we could keep it quiet, but with 20? Really? That in itself would be a feat, especially with AATA on the team, he would be the first to blow the lid on it. We spend much of the day explaining our removals to users who ask, so, it would be impossible for us to conceal a removal which did not violate the rules. Like I have said, please provide me with evidence of submissions that were removed which painted Israel is a disparaging light that did NOT violate the rules of the sub. Search thru <a href="/r/undeleteworldnews">/r/undeleteworldnews</a>, that should be a good place to find any, if they do indeed exist. If you do have any questions about any, please ask. I will respond. And please, I hope you respond to this thoughtfully and unbiasedly. All I want to do here is help explain things to this group which CLEARLY has a misunderstanding about what is going on. We are as transparent and open of sub as you will find. Please just ask us about things in the future instead of starting these sort of silly unfounded accusatory threads about how evil and corrupt we all are. That is about as far from the truth as you can get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I noticed nothing came up on my front page anymore. That&#39;s why I said you might be able to find some stuff by trolling through the top postings. Just things to highlight the bias in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks OP for shedding some light on this. This is simply terrible of the mods in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. I&#39;ve noticed a very strong pro-Zionist feel in worldnews for quite some time since joining reddit back. </p>

<p>Yeah, you can sense that anything showing Israel, the IDF, MOSSAD, or the Likud party in a negative light is either removed, or the pro-Zionist shill-force immediately jumps on the &quot;Down-Vote to Hell&quot; bandwagon, and nothing&#39;s ever heard of again of the article(s). </p>

<p>Like, my God, it was only thanks to this subreddit, or through some other subreddits, that I only learned the other day that Likud&#39;s founding members were part of a terrorist group! So the foundation/basis of this party is one based on terrorism, yet they were hailed as freedom-fighters. But Hamas is considered terrorists!? (Yes, I know they&#39;ve killed innocent people, so they&#39;ve got blood on their hands, and all warmongering parties need to be held accountable) </p>

<p>Anyways, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> is totally biased, and I only go there to see what&#39;s generally being upvoted. </p>

<p>Thanks for putting this thread/post together, and keep up the good fight. </p>

<p>p.s. I dont feel or believe all Jews are bad. There are both good &amp; bad in all nations/races/groups. But the peace-loving Jews are having their voices of reconciliation being drowned out by warmongering Zionists. I&#39;d say it&#39;s the same for the peace-loving Palestinians too by Hamas or other fanatical groups. </p>
