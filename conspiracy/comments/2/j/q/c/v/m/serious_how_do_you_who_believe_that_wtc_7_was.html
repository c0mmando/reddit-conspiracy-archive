        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The world record for tallest building ever demolished by explosives is 26 stories. That building required 12 people working full time for 24 days to wire. It needed 4118 charges placed in 1100 locations, 2800 pounds of explosive and 36000 feet of detonating wire. The men that wired it had unfettered access to a completely empty building and had to take out walls to gain access to support columns.</p>

<p>WTC7 was 21 stories taller than this world record demolition. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>How was the building wired up without anyone knowing? Support columns were buried behind drywall, desks, cubicles and office equipment.</p>

<ul>
<li>How did the most involved and elaborate demolition wiring job in history survive fires burning on 12 floors? Wire tends to stop working when it&#39;s burnt to a crisp. This doesn&#39;t even take into account the damage done by falling debris.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In order for your theory to have any legs at all, you need to explain how a building that would have shattered the world record for demolition by 21 stories was wired up surreptitiously without disturbing any of the employees or alerting security, then set on fire for 7 hours, then still went off without a hitch. </p>

<p>So can anybody give me their best logical, factual (not assumptions) reason why WTC7 could even possibly be considered to have been brought down by controlled demolition? Because 13 years later that hypothesis still makes absolutely no sense. WTC 7 being bought down by aliens even seems more plausible. </p>

<p>You make a good point. How <em>could</em> the building possibly have been prepared and wired for demolition without anyone&#39;s knowledge?</p>

<p>But consider the alternative: That the building collapsed symmetrically - at near free-fall speed - just like in would have in a controlled demolition - and NONE of the walls, support columns or other key structural components were weakened or prepared at all!</p>

<p>Does that not seem unlikely?</p>

<p>Wow, that was an amazing wall of text. Indeed, it looks a lot like WTC7 did immediately prior to collapse. Would you mind posting it again, only this time without punctuation or capitalization? </p>

<p>That post makes me suspect that you and <a href="/u/Beneneb">/u/Beneneb</a> are actually undercover agents working for Johnson &amp; Johnson - trying to increase the demand for Tylenol.</p>

<p>What I have gleaned from reading your comments in this thread is that you have <em>no clue</em> with regard to the subject matter, rather, you appear to be a sycophant simpleton mesmerized by those who you believe to be authority figures, and have taken it on yourself to proselytize with a level of blind zeal that is usually reserved to religious fanaticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incorrect on all front, you are the one ignoring evidence.  I acknowledge both sides and reserve judgement till more evidence is presented, although there are more and less convincing arguments, of which NIST is clearly pretty far on the BS side. The minority does not always detonate incorrectness (which should be obvious...I have no idea why you wouldn&#39;t understand this), but against your baseless assumptions about my &quot;ideas&quot; lead you to make more bad assumptions ex. that I would be in a minority.

You have such horrific comprehension skills that even after I have clearly stated where I am coming from you still cannot piece it together.  You should probably get an adult to explain it to you, as I doubt you will ever possess the necessary intellect to grasp my position.  I will however attempt to explain it as simply as possible for you, though I fear it will be futile.  My position, and that of any ration human being, is that there is no consensus on what really happened, but we can still draw some basic conclusion ex. office fires cannot cause building to fall like this etc.  One possible explanation is non-traditional CD.  There are others, but none are completely provable due to lack of evidence (which is a story unto itself).  What is very easily proven however is that the NIST version is complete BS, as has been shown countless times throughout this thread, but you choose to ignore due to your many mental deficiencies.  Was that simplified enough for you?</p>

<p>In addition the video you link is complete BS as all your links have been.  This kid has no relevant degree, is not an expert of any kind, and is as useless in this debate as a random stranger off the street.  The mere fact that you linked to it proves that you not only have no idea what you are talking about, but also that you have not a clue on what is and isn&#39;t good information, which again calls into question your mental abilities.  This has been repeated again and again in this thread by many people, who again you ignore with the most pathetic &quot;deflection&quot; due to your cognitive dissonance.  And as these others have pointed out, you still have yet to provide a scrap of evidence that ae911 is anything but credible.  </p>

<p>I will admit it is amusing to watch you spiral continually downward, and your incoherent arrogant pretentious but above all ignorant and baseless comments get down-voted into oblivion just like they do on all the other subs you post in.  You&#39;d think by now it may have prompted some introspection, but I&#39;m sure your mental sicknesses prevent any such personal growth. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I ever said I &quot;believed&quot; it? There&#39;s no question that it&#39;s more plausible than NIST&#39;s explanation or the FEMA report claiming pancaking. (Even your government agencies couldn&#39;t agree on how it happened). Especially in light of the Jones/Harrit paper on thermite in the dust, watching actual demonstrations of energetic chips igniting and thermite cutting structural steel. I also consider a lifetime (I&#39;m 68) of watching the US government (other governments too) lie about everything under the sun in order to increase their power. There&#39;s also the issue of the towers&#39; condemnation with them due for billions in repairs/renovations by 2007. Let&#39;s not forget the 5 Dancing Israelis and the &quot;art students&quot;, the power outages days before the events, security system shutdowns, security dogs removed, construction on several floors, unusual truck deliveries at night etc etc etc. And that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg preceding the events. The stuff that&#39;s happened afterward is another major issue. The PNAC report: &quot;the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event––like a new Pearl Harbor&quot; (Sept 2000). The planned invasion of 7 Muslim countries that have since come to fruition as a result of 9/11.  It&#39;s not all just based on one single issue. There&#39;s a myriad of events and they all point to the destruction being planned.</p>

<p>&quot;Structural engineer here.</p>

<p>It is impossible for a steel building the size of WTC7 to topple over like the building in the video you showed. It is neither strong nor rigid enough to be able to form a pivot point about which to topple. The NIST report does a very good job of explaining the mechanisms that led all of the columns to fail in a short time. I recommend you read it if you haven&#39;t and I can answer any questions you have about it. I actually wrote a big post a while back explaining building 7, specifically how it is possible for it to collapse at free fall without the use of explosives (that seems to be the argument they always fall back on). Unfortunately I just got more typical responses basically telling me that I am wrong and my sources are bad without any legitimate rebuttals. Anyway, if you are curious to read it I have pasted it below and tried to add a bit more explanation of some concepts, hopefully it&#39;s not too boring. Let me begin by referring you to this article by Dr. Zdenek Bazant, considered the worlds foremost expert on solid mechanics. This is an article he wrote shortly after 9/11 where he mathematically proves a progressive collapse of the twin towers was inevitable. I recommend you read the entire article if you haven&#39;t already, but for the purpose of this argument just read the section on inelastic energy dissipation. Now before I go any further, I realize you are referring to WTC 7, not the twin towers, but I&#39;m simply using this as a proof of concept. To sum up the points he is making, essentially what happens is that as the tower falls it quickly gains an enormous amount of kinetic energy, and after falling as few as four floors: the percentage of the kinetic energy dissipated plastically is then of the order of 1%. The percentage continues to decrease further as the upper part moves down. If fracturing in the plastic hinges were considered, a still smaller (in fact much smaller) energy dissipation would be obtained. So the collapse of the tower must be an almost free fall. That means that the resistance of the building was significantly less than 1% after falling only a short distance, and the resistance of the building only continues to decline as the collapse progresses allowing the collapse to occur at free fall. And please don&#39;t say &quot;well this is almost free fall, not free fall&quot;. We are talking about resistance that is on the same scale as air resistance, so small you can&#39;t detect it from the methods used to calculate the WTC 7 decent. Now to WTC7. The same concept applies here, although the one major difference is that in WTC1 and 2, to lower portion of the buildings was largely undamaged, whereas with WTC7, it was heavily damaged by the time the collapse began. Before I talk about why WTC7 collapsed I need to briefly go over the concept of column buckling. Buckling is a stability related failure as opposed to a strength related failure. This means that buckling failure occurs not because the material is too weak, but because the column is not stable. The stability of a column depends on two things; the unsupported length, and a cross sectional property known as the second moment of area. This means that you can have two columns which are identical except for their length, that will have different load capacities. You can demonstrate this to yourself with a straw. If you have a straw (say 10 inches long) and you cut it into two pieces one 9 inches and one 1 inch, then stand these straw up on a table and push straight down on them. You will find that the taller straw will buckle with much less force. Now take the 9 inch straw and do the exact same thing again, except take the hand you aren&#39;t pushing with and use your thumb and index finger to hold the straw half way in between the table and your other hand, to prevent it from buckling at this location. You will now find it is more difficult to buckle the straw because you have provided &quot;lateral support&quot; and effectively reduced the length of the straw in half. We use the same concept in steel design. You will have a column which is continuous all the way up a building, but each floor gives lateral support, meaning that the effective length is only 12ish feet. It is also worth noting that doubling a columns length reduces the force a column can support to 25%. Sorry if this is a boring lesson, but it is essential if you want to understand why WTC7 fell. In case you are unfamiliar I will go over the sequence of events leading to collapse. It started with a main girder collapsing due to thermal expansion from the fire which caused the local collapse of about 7 floors around a main core column. This removed the lateral support for the column, significantly reducing it&#39;s ability to carry load and causing its collapse. As it collapsed, it took out a truss on the second and third floors which was supporting two more core columns, causing there collapse. This then created a chain reaction causing the entire core to collapse, resulting from increased laterally unsupported length. It is now important to note that the entire core collapses before you actually see the global collapse of the building from the outside. So when you watch those videos and see the building begin to come down, the entire core is already gone. Now we are left with just the perimeter columns. The floors are supported on girders which span from the core to the perimeter columns, and because the core is gone, so are the floors. This means that the perimeter columns have now lost most of there lateral support. Needless to say, these columns were now overloaded and had only a small fraction of there initial capacity. As they begin to collapse they still do provide some resistance, hence the initial period of less than free fall decent. However, similar to what is described in the article above, the rapidly increasing kinetic energy of the falling structure combined with the fact that the buckled columns would quickly fracture means that it soon provides negligible resistance, hence your 2.25 seconds of free fall. As the collapse continues, more of the structure impacts the ground, which means there is less mass above and less kinetic energy, combined with the fact that the top half of the building was less damaged means the rate of decent begins to slow down. This fits all observations of the building collapse, fits in with the official story, and I didn&#39;t have to break physics to do it. If you believe in the CD hypothesis then I would like to ask you why there was only 2.25 seconds of free fall. Shouldn&#39;t free fall begin almost immediately and last almost the whole way down?&quot;</p>

<p>On the contrary, the vast overwhelming evidence disagrees with the NIST report. The NIST report includes a model that <em>prima facie</em> does not jive with what is clearly visible in every video of the actual event. Secondly, NIST refuses to make public the computer model they used to generate this model. When they were forced, eventually, to make some of the data points available, the only way their model worked was by fudging the numbers. So, if you review the structural models that the 1,900 members of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth produced, it is clear that the NIST explanation is and must be a myth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTC 7 was 571 ft, the official world record is 439 ft. Not quite as dramatic, and was done by a low cost bidder. Where the C.I.A, NSA, Mossad , ect.. would have 100&#39;s of Billions of dollars and top secret explosives research at their disposal.

<p>As to gaining access that would be easy for the nations spy agencies. Posing as facilities to do work on the building is an easy ploy. I&#39;ve worked in a corporate office, and hearing building maintenance is a constant presence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate your response, but you have major gaps in your reasoining. I don&#39;t think you truly understand that task of bringing down a building with explosives. It requires extensive wiring and access to colums, tons of explosives. You failed to address the bombs would not explode after 7 straight hours of fire, nor the logisital issues to even get the massive amounts of explosives and bombs planted in there. There are many claims you failed to address.</p>

<p>Yea I knew someone was going to bring this up..thermite. Sorry, laughable again as thermite cant be directionally controlled (or controlled really at all)</p>

<p>I&#39;d really appreciate if someone offered a step-by-step refutation with no gaps in reasoining. </p>

<p>You&#39;re also making assumptions that an office fire would destroy a top secrete explosive device. You don&#39;t know the location of the fires in comparison to the explosives anyway. Nano thermite wouldn&#39;t need wires because of wireless detonators.</p>

<p>If you can not accept obvious proof that you are wrong and admit it, you have no integrity.</p>

<p>The following is cut and paste from United States Military Field Manual FM 5-250; </p>

<p>Explosives and Demolitions, </p>

<p>June 1992: </p>

<p>Page 86 </p>

<p>3-6. Steel-Cutting Charges. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(d) Nickel-molybdenum steel. This type of steel cannot be cut easily by conventional steel-cutting charges. The jet from a shaped charge will penetrate it, but cutting requires multiple charges or linear-shaped charges. Nickel-molybdenum steel shafts can be cut with a diamond charge. However, the saddle charge will not cut nickel-molybdenum shafts. Therefore, use some method other than explosives to cut nickel-molybdenum steel, such as <strong>THERMITE</strong> or acetylene or electrical cutting tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FM 5-250 @<a href="http://www.thefrontiersmen.org/pdf/Field%20Manuals/FM%205/FM_5-250.pdf">http://www.thefrontiersmen.org/pdf/Field%20Manuals/FM%205/FM_5-250.pdf</a> (careful) </p>

<p>So if you care to look into it, the military has been using thermite to bring down hardened structures since at least 1992, I have seen sources that said they used in in WWII.</p>

<p>Man up dude and admit you are wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The world record for tallest building ever demolished by explosives is 26 stories. That building required 12 people working full time for 24 days to wire. It needed 4118 charges placed in 1100 locations, 2800 pounds of explosive and 36000 feet of detonating wire. The men that wired it had unfettered access to a completely empty building and had to take out walls to gain access to support columns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so asymmetrical damage and asymmetrical fire can cause a symmetrical collapse? this seems implausible to me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>WTC7 was 21 stories taller than this world record demolition. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>buildings have life expectancies, with contingencies for demolition built into construction. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How was the building wired up without anyone knowing? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How would you know what was not known? Your presumption is that &quot;someone would talk&quot;, yet there are many 9/11 whistleblowers you will refuse to listen to. </p>

<p>Support columns were buried behind drywall, desks, cubicles and office equipment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did the most involved and elaborate demolition wiring job in history survive fires burning on 12 floors? Wire tends to stop working when it&#39;s burnt to a crisp. This doesn&#39;t even take into account the damage done by falling debris.</p>

<p>In order for your theory to have any legs at all, you need to explain how a building that would have shattered the world record for demolition by 21 stories was wired up surreptitiously without disturbing any of the employees or alerting security, then set on fire for 7 hours, then still went off without a hitch. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>a) you are still relying on the &quot;without people knowing&quot; fallacy by claiming to know what people didn&#39;t know, which is not knowable to you. b) if the fire/damage is asymmetrical, how does it cause a collapse that is more symmetrical than some <em>known</em> controlled demolitions? random damage does it cleaner than the pros? <em>without a hitch</em> implies you are ignoring the <em>hitches</em> like the BBC reporting the collapse 20 minutes early, then conveniently misplacing the video in the archive. or Larry Silverstein admitting he watched WTC7 collapse, implying his <em>eyes</em> were on the building when it collapsed, which is a rather convenient place to have your eyes focused at the exact right time to <em>see</em> it collapse in under 10 seconds. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So can anybody give me their best logical, factual (not assumptions) reason why WTC7 could even possibly be considered to have been brought down by controlled demolition? Because 13 years later that hypothesis still makes absolutely no sense. WTC 7 being bought down by aliens even seems more plausible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>one assumption you and others seem to rely on is the old &quot;it would take too many people&quot; fallacy, then grossly overestimate the number of people it would actually take, as if a covert demolition would be magnitudes more work than an overt demolition of the same building.</p>

<p>as you claim you are an engineering student I will leave you with one last question to ponder. how much physical labor would it take to turn a concrete block to dust. if you had a hammer, how much work would it take to pulverize a block? now ask how much energy it would take to turn WTC 1 and WTC 2 to dust. </p>

This aspect of WTC7 hypothesis has been sadly thouroughly discussed and debunked, I&#39;d direct to this (source)[<a href="https://www.metabunk.org/threads/thermite-has-historically-been-used-for-demolition-at-least-twice.2856/">https://www.metabunk.org/threads/thermite-has-historically-been-used-for-demolition-at-least-twice.2856/</a>] since its been greatly discussed there. </p>

<p>The site you are referring to: <strong>&quot;metabunk.org&quot; has been completely discredited</strong>. It is run by persons with NO SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND named Mick West, Jay Reynolds and Ross Marsden.</p>

<p>This same site is heavy into the vigorous denial of Climate Change. So, the mere fact that you have referenced metabunk.org as a site casts scorn on your entire post.</p>

<p>So, you are an engineering student at Long Beach City College, someone who has taken second semester Calculus, and you are trying to refute the professional judgement of the 1,900 members of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth--who categorically disagree with you. You have admitted here on reddit that you grew up with a chip on your shoulder based on your difficult upbringing. So, is that why you&#39;re trying to stick your finger in the eye of all these people who question the official line on WTC Building 7? Your logic is not making sense in the comments you&#39;ve made here, you cite a discredited source to back up your claims, or the original single guy who wrote the NIST report as your single bit of scientific evidence. In short, guy, you&#39;re digging yourself a deeper hole and it&#39;s apparent that your -100 link karma is heading further South...</p>

<p>I am and always have been completely on topic.  The mere fact that you do not see that is troubling by itself.  The evidence has been provided by myself and many others on this thread.  As I (and most others here) said its not that it MUST be traditional CD or nothing, just that the NIST version is clearly incorrect and non-traditional CD is a possible explanation, as has been pointed out to you countless times in this thread.  Again the fact that you ignore this points to the cognitive dissonance etc. all by itself.  It&#39;s rather pathetic how many times you have ignored ae911 and others evidence that contradicts your extremely limited view.</p>

I have linked ae911 so many times, and the best you could do, as many others have pointed out, is link to a completely BS youtube vid of some other random completely unqualified kid spewing nonsense.  Since that is the best you can do, and you have yet to refute a thing, and I have literally thousands of experts on my side, the burden of proof is on you.  In addition I am 100% sure that with a de-politicized discussion every logical and ration person on any forum you can name would agree that the NIST fabrication is BS and that it is possible to non-standard CD towers of that size, as have been made completely evident by ae911, 911truth and many many many others. </p>

<p>But office fires provide the logic you seek? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="/u/benthamitemetric">/u/benthamitemetric</a></p>

<p>First, many are not aware of this, but NIST&#39;s WTC 7 report has itself been independently peer reviewed by and published in the Journal of Structural Engineering, the ASCE&#39;s flagship publication and one of the oldest and most prestigious peer reviewed engineering journals in the world: <a href="http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?286345">http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?286345</a></p>

<p>Second, NIST&#39;s findings re the collapse initiation of WTC 7 were all corroborated under oath by several preeminent experts (e.g., Guy Nordenson, Joseph P. Colaco, and Jose Torero) who independently created and analyzed their own collapse model at Edinburgh University: * <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/a3c33b98-9cbf-4b82-b557-6088e207c8f6/1/doc/11-4403_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/a3c33b98-9cbf-4b82-b557-6088e207c8f6/1/hilite/">http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/a3c33b98-9cbf-4b82-b557-6088e207c8f6/1/doc/11-4403_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/a3c33b98-9cbf-4b82-b557-6088e207c8f6/1/hilite/</a></p>

<p>The testimony of those experts is of special salience because Aegis Insurance, the plaintiff that retained them, was liable for hundreds of millions of dollars could it not present the strongest possible case as to negligence on the part of 7 WTCo., Tishman, and other related parties. In other words, it had every possible incentive to argue that there were controlled demolition devices used (which, if proven true, would far exceed the standard for negligence). Yet it&#39;s experts simply confirmed what NIST had concluded re a fire-induced progressive collapse that initiated at column 79. EDIT: And here are links to the specific sworn affidavits of those experts:</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Since there is no copyright on these materials, I&#39;m going to just post full text in the comments.</p>

<p>Third, there have been many, many peer reviewed engineering articles published that directly analyze, draw upon, and confirm or otherwise independently corroborate NIST&#39;s methodology and conclusions. Here are links to those that I could find and review in about 3 hours of searching (remember, these are just the papers that include support for NIST&#39;s WTC 7 model; there are many, many more that only explicitly support NIST&#39;s WTC 1 &amp; 2 collapse hypotheses):</p>

<p>&quot;Also notable is that, in my search for peer reviewed articles that cited to the NIST WTC 7 report, I could not find a single paper that was critical of NIST&#39;s methodologies or conclusions. Not even one. Fourth, there is not a single major professional engineering organization that has spoken out against the NIST report&#39;s conclusions and many that have explicitly endorsed it: * The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitats explicitly endorsed NIST&#39;s WTC 7 findings: <a href="http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/TechnicalGuides/CommentsonNISTWTC7/tabid/739/language/en-US/Default.aspx">http://www.ctbuh.org/Publications/TechnicalGuides/CommentsonNISTWTC7/tabid/739/language/en-US/Default.aspx</a> * The AIA (American Institute of Architects) not only explicitly endorsed NIST&#39;s WTC 7 findings, <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2009-08-22/letter-aia-president-richard-gage-aia">http://911blogger.com/news/2009-08-22/letter-aia-president-richard-gage-aia</a>, it explicitly rejected Richard Gage&#39;s contrary claims: <a href="http://www.architectmagazine.com/architecture/architects-shy-from-truther-conspiracy-theory_1.aspx">http://www.architectmagazine.com/architecture/architects-shy-from-truther-conspiracy-theory_1.aspx</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The ICC (International Code Council) has also accepted NIST&#39;s conclusions as valid and commenced debate on NIST&#39;s recommendations: <a href="http://www.iccsafe.org/cs/CTC/Pages/NIST-WorldTradeCenterRecommendations.aspx">http://www.iccsafe.org/cs/CTC/Pages/NIST-WorldTradeCenterRecommendations.aspx</a></p></li>
<li><p>Stanford&#39;s Engineering Department has also endorsed NIST&#39;s conclusions, <a href="https://blume.stanford.edu/content/collapse-performance-assessment-steel-framed-buildings-under-fires">https://blume.stanford.edu/content/collapse-performance-assessment-steel-framed-buildings-under-fires</a>, and engineers there continue to research based on NIST&#39;s findings: <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-engineers-study-911-lessons-how-help-buildings-withstand-threats">https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-engineers-study-911-lessons-how-help-buildings-withstand-threats</a></p></li>
<li><p>And many other prominent structural engineers and building code experts are on record explicitly endorsing NIST&#39;s conclusions: <a href="http://enr.construction.com/news/buildings/archives/080903.asp">http://enr.construction.com/news/buildings/archives/080903.asp</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In short, the support for NIST&#39;s WTC 7 conclusions is incredibly extensive, robust, and nearly universal among actual structural engineers. In contrast, there are ZERO peer reviewed critiques of NIST&#39;s WTC 7 report, ZERO PhD structural engineers on record supporting an alternative collapse hypothesis, and ZERO high-rise specialized structural engineers with any level of degree on record supporting an alternative hypothesis. (For example, there are less than 50 members of ae911truth who claim to be structural engineers, none of them claim to be high-rise experts, none of them have PhDs, and less than half of them even have masters degrees: <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/signatures/ae.html.">http://www.ae911truth.org/signatures/ae.html.</a>)</p>

<p>The support for NIST&#39;s WTC 7 report&#39;s methodologies and conclusions is thus overwhelming among those qualified to truly evaluated it. If that isn&#39;t a scientific consensus, I don&#39;t know what one is.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, duh. Those critical of the NIST report are called names and might risk losing government contracts if they question the official story.</p>

<p>There are at least 2000+ architects and engineers not dependent on public contracts who question the official fairy tale:</p>

<p>sigh ae911truth is a bunch of ill-informed landscape architects. Half of them arent even Structural Engineers yet alone Civil Engineers so half of their credentials aren&#39;t even the right ones. Secondly, their are over 200,000 Mechanical Engineers, over 200,000 electrical engineers, 200,000+ Civil Engineers, and 80,000+ Licensed Structural engineers, but yet that crackpot of a group called AE911 truth only managed to squeek out 2000 signatures, most of which who arent even structural engineers.</p>

<p>Like I said, their is no evidence to support their hypothesis, the NIST report did a good job of explaining what happened, and Scientific Peer reviewed papers by Banzant did a good job of explaining why the towers fell without the need for the controlled demolish hypotheses. If their was such an obvious case for controlled demo hypothesis, then you would of seen an out cry from physicist and engineers everywhere, but you don&#39;t. Ask yourself why?</p>

<p>More food for thought: Ae911truth has made well over a million dollars. Why hasn&#39;t it used that money to publish a single peer reviewed paper supporting even a single one of its claims about the NIST model? It&#39;s silly in the face of the other published literature. And you wonder why Conspiracy Theorist get a bad rep, it because of people who think exactly like yourself.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t qualify as logical, factual refutation, what it does qualify for is a nonsensical statement.</p>

<p>Please reread the original post, and offer refutation and explain every step of the way with no gaps in your reasoning please.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t start at the end and pressuppose that explosives were there in the first place. You have to start your theory from the beginning as to how such a job was even possible.</p>

<p>You should rephrase your argument. <em>&quot;If the 12 stories were partially on fire, wouldn&#39;t this mean some of the explosives were ruined? Also, if a small percentage of the explosives in the building were ruined, do you think the rest of them were sufficient to bring down the building?&quot;</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, it certainly does. <em>Occams Razor</em>. I don&#39;t know what emotional attachment you have to CD hypothesis, but there are a gluttony of scientific literature peer reviewed, that supports Progressive Collapse theory and none that support CD hypothesis. Not one scientific article in 13 years has ever put forth a hypothesis for CD.</p>

<p>So why are you trying so hard to believe in CD? I just don&#39;t understand why you believe in that hypothesis when there is no substantial evidence for it, yet plenty for the contrary. Why aren&#39;t you following the evidence?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted many scientific peer reviewed literature that does this, look down in the comments.</p>

<p>Also his reply wasn&#39;t logical by any standard, maybe only to those like yourself who are too emotionally invested in a particular narrative.</p>

<p>You do know there are many peer review articles in the 13 subsequent years that has passed since 9/11 that has come to the same conclusion as NIST right? Reputable Academic Journals and World Renowned Structural Engineering journals, countless independent investigations that came up with the same results as NIST. So if you think you know something the Engineering and Physics community don&#39;t, then why not put your money where your mouth is and do your own investigation and publish it for peer review?</p>

<p>You can insult me all you want, how about insult the facts? Just a note to anyone who reads this, this isn&#39;t how to conduct an argument. My opponent is exhibiting classic symptoms of ad hominem fallacy. Its when a party chooses to insult the debater instead of responding to the facts. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>My opponent failed to address 1) How the biggest explosive job in history could be conducted, not only conducted, but conducted in SECRECY on top of that. </p></li>
<li><p>My opponent failed to address 2) The extreme logistical complications that would arise and how to reconcile it with their CD theory accusations. </p></li>
<li><p>My opponent failed to address 3) The huge volume of peer reviews scientific research conducted by many independent organizations that came to the same conclusions as NIST and why not one found NISTs account incompetent nor did my opponent address why not one CD hypotheses has ever been rigorously put forth. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let him be an example of how <em>not</em> to conduct an argument. If you have a case, please use facts, logical extrapolation voided of insults and emotional appeals and use hard evidence with no gaps in your reasoning. Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putting the burden of proof on this sub will probably work, because the truth is that no one has the facts that refute the official explanation. I don&#39;t know what happened, and honestly think that building 7 is kind of a distraction. But I don&#39;t trust that the conspiracy or confirmation bias hasn&#39;t infiltrated the corroborating sources you&#39;ve provided thus far. </p>

<p>As for the time/access it takes to wire a building, if it&#39;s being assumed that people pulled off the most massive conspiracy in history, it follows that it took several years of clandestine operations to set it all up. After certain black ops were exposed in the 80&#39;s, they didn&#39;t stop they just got better at concealment and compartmentalization. Can I prove this? No, of course not.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but before I respond just to make sure I don&#39;t put words in your mouth; Are you saying you don&#39;t trust the independently investigates peer reviewed scientific research sources that came to the same conclusions as NIST?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but facts stand alone. There are many peer review independent investigation done in the subsequent 13 years since 9/11 other than Stanford that came to the same conclusions. Besides, you not trusting the character of Stanford or accusations of supposed allegiance to government/military contractors have no bearing on the validity of the research done by Stanford. Peer review research is put out there for the public to see. If you want to refute the specific claims they put forth in their analysis, then do so, because these &quot;backdoor&quot; refutations that you have, and others on this topic that fail to address the facts, but instead attempt to smear the image of someone/agency, isn&#39;t how to conduct logical argument. You&#39;ve still yet to attempt to explain why a progressive collapse which has independently been the conclusion by many organizations came to isnt plausible but yet a controlled demolition of accounts never seen is before.

<p>Well you claimed that the scientific peer reviewed literature aren&#39;t &quot;Trusted&quot; sources, so based on that I can conclude that your on the side of the CD hypotheses correct? I sense you may be frustrated that you cannot come up with no substantial evidence that can validate your CD, if thats the case why believe something with no substantial evidence? And If you aren&#39;t interested in debate, why make a claim for a opposing side?</p>

Perhaps there is an issue with access.  But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tenants_in_Seven_World_Trade_Center">Salomon Smith Barney</a> had offices on almost every floor.  So it was certainly not impossible.</p>

<p>You seem to be stuck on this idea that it was carried out by a handful of people, surreptitiously, without disturbing anyone in the buildings themselves.  That&#39;s probably not the case, and not even really a requirement.  There could have been thousands of people involved in 9/11, and simply paid off.  The Federal Reserve printed trillions of dollars after 9/11.  Most of the workers in those buildings were bankers.</p>

<p>If you can not accept obvious proof that you are wrong and admit it, you have no integrity.</p>

<p>The following is cut and paste from United States Military Field Manual FM 5-250; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(d) Nickel-molybdenum steel. This type of steel cannot be cut easily by conventional steel-cutting charges. The jet from a shaped charge will penetrate it, but cutting requires multiple charges or linear-shaped charges. Nickel-molybdenum steel shafts can be cut with a diamond charge. However, the saddle charge will not cut nickel-molybdenum shafts. Therefore, use some method other than explosives to cut nickel-molybdenum steel, such as <strong>THERMITE</strong> or acetylene or electrical cutting tools.</p>

<p>So if you care to look into it, the military has been using thermite to bring down hardened structures since at least 1992, I have seen sources that said they used it in WWII.</p>

<p>Explosives are removing chunks of metal and any delays in the explosions are the intentions of those doing the demolitions. A nano-thermite demolition works by melting junctions in the metal and the timing is entirely up to the persons firing the switches. </p>

<p>&quot;Structural engineer here.</p>

<p>It is impossible for a steel building the size of WTC7 to topple over like the building in the video you showed. It is neither strong nor rigid enough to be able to form a pivot point about which to topple. The NIST report does a very good job of explaining the mechanisms that led all of the columns to fail in a short time. I recommend you read it if you haven&#39;t and I can answer any questions you have about it. I actually wrote a big post a while back explaining building 7, specifically how it is possible for it to collapse at free fall without the use of explosives (that seems to be the argument they always fall back on). Unfortunately I just got more typical responses basically telling me that I am wrong and my sources are bad without any legitimate rebuttals. Anyway, if you are curious to read it I have pasted it below and tried to add a bit more explanation of some concepts, hopefully it&#39;s not too boring. Let me begin by referring you to this article by Dr. Zdenek Bazant, considered the worlds foremost expert on solid mechanics. This is an article he wrote shortly after 9/11 where he mathematically proves a progressive collapse of the twin towers was inevitable. I recommend you read the entire article if you haven&#39;t already, but for the purpose of this argument just read the section on inelastic energy dissipation. Now before I go any further, I realize you are referring to WTC 7, not the twin towers, but I&#39;m simply using this as a proof of concept. To sum up the points he is making, essentially what happens is that as the tower falls it quickly gains an enormous amount of kinetic energy, and after falling as few as four floors: the percentage of the kinetic energy dissipated plastically is then of the order of 1%. The percentage continues to decrease further as the upper part moves down. If fracturing in the plastic hinges were considered, a still smaller (in fact much smaller) energy dissipation would be obtained. So the collapse of the tower must be an almost free fall. That means that the resistance of the building was significantly less than 1% after falling only a short distance, and the resistance of the building only continues to decline as the collapse progresses allowing the collapse to occur at free fall. And please don&#39;t say &quot;well this is almost free fall, not free fall&quot;. We are talking about resistance that is on the same scale as air resistance, so small you can&#39;t detect it from the methods used to calculate the WTC 7 decent. Now to WTC7. The same concept applies here, although the one major difference is that in WTC1 and 2, to lower portion of the buildings was largely undamaged, whereas with WTC7, it was heavily damaged by the time the collapse began. Before I talk about why WTC7 collapsed I need to briefly go over the concept of column buckling. Buckling is a stability related failure as opposed to a strength related failure. This means that buckling failure occurs not because the material is too weak, but because the column is not stable. The stability of a column depends on two things; the unsupported length, and a cross sectional property known as the second moment of area. This means that you can have two columns which are identical except for their length, that will have different load capacities. You can demonstrate this to yourself with a straw. If you have a straw (say 10 inches long) and you cut it into two pieces one 9 inches and one 1 inch, then stand these straw up on a table and push straight down on them. You will find that the taller straw will buckle with much less force. Now take the 9 inch straw and do the exact same thing again, except take the hand you aren&#39;t pushing with and use your thumb and index finger to hold the straw half way in between the table and your other hand, to prevent it from buckling at this location. You will now find it is more difficult to buckle the straw because you have provided &quot;lateral support&quot; and effectively reduced the length of the straw in half. We use the same concept in steel design. You will have a column which is continuous all the way up a building, but each floor gives lateral support, meaning that the effective length is only 12ish feet. It is also worth noting that doubling a columns length reduces the force a column can support to 25%. Sorry if this is a boring lesson, but it is essential if you want to understand why WTC7 fell. In case you are unfamiliar I will go over the sequence of events leading to collapse. It started with a main girder collapsing due to thermal expansion from the fire which caused the local collapse of about 7 floors around a main core column. This removed the lateral support for the column, significantly reducing it&#39;s ability to carry load and causing its collapse. As it collapsed, it took out a truss on the second and third floors which was supporting two more core columns, causing there collapse. This then created a chain reaction causing the entire core to collapse, resulting from increased laterally unsupported length. It is now important to note that the entire core collapses before you actually see the global collapse of the building from the outside. So when you watch those videos and see the building begin to come down, the entire core is already gone. Now we are left with just the perimeter columns. The floors are supported on girders which span from the core to the perimeter columns, and because the core is gone, so are the floors. This means that the perimeter columns have now lost most of there lateral support. Needless to say, these columns were now overloaded and had only a small fraction of there initial capacity. As they begin to collapse they still do provide some resistance, hence the initial period of less than free fall decent. However, similar to what is described in the article above, the rapidly increasing kinetic energy of the falling structure combined with the fact that the buckled columns would quickly fracture means that it soon provides negligible resistance, hence your 2.25 seconds of free fall. As the collapse continues, more of the structure impacts the ground, which means there is less mass above and less kinetic energy, combined with the fact that the top half of the building was less damaged means the rate of decent begins to slow down. This fits all observations of the building collapse, fits in with the official story, and I didn&#39;t have to break physics to do it. If you believe in the CD hypothesis then I would like to ask you why there was only 2.25 seconds of free fall. Shouldn&#39;t free fall begin almost immediately and last almost the whole way down?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me make this clear, your position is not based on hardcore evidence of any sort. Your position is totally based on your ignorance of science and engineering. You dont understand the science so instead you want to make shit up. Your just like the idiots who deny evolution. You don&#39;t understand the scientific process nor respect it, but that is not excuse to make shit up and ignore the wealth of peer reviewed scientific data.</p>

<p>Any engineering department across the country will laugh at your extraordinary claimd with the extreme lack of evidence. You think nist is false? Well you have a shit ton of explaining to do of which you have not done. No math, nothing.</p>
