<p>interesting. i imagine that every phone tablet pc&#39;s camera is always on and recording literally everything</p>

<p>the good news is that, sure there&#39;s no secrets.... but we have to all understand that <em>nobody</em> has secrets. so, its a collective feeling of shame. but its better that way because &#39;&#39;fuck it, i know you&#39;re shit, you know my shit&#39;&#39; </p>

<p>I acutally believe that they record every phone call and sweep up most e-mail out there, but I&#39;m pretty sure this is simply impossible.</p>

<p>First of all, if it was a physical thing where they had to intercept the hardware and install the spy device then why would they do that to every single phone and tablet? There are literally hundreds of millions of them. </p>

<p>Secondly, that&#39;s audio and video to store. It&#39;s just too much.</p>

<p>The physical intercepts would be for specific targets or specific types of hardware (enterprise level stuff for example). Not the most popular consumer product that literally everyone has.</p>

<p>In Foucault’s words “…the major effect of the Panopticon; to induce in the inmate a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power. So to arrange things that the surveillance is permanent in its effects, even if it is discontinuous in its action; that the perfection of power should tend to render its actual exercise unnecessary” In short, under the possibility of total surveillance the inmate becomes <strong>self regulating.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that there&#39;s just one thing the NSA is not lying about: the Snowden revelations have done <em>real, lasting damage</em> to the NSA&#39;s little con game! Look at the latest news about Apple and Google encrypting their phones - it doesn&#39;t matter even if they&#39;re lying, the fact that it plays with the public is a major blow to the US-and-allied-intel establishment! The person on the street is supposed to feel like &quot;I ain&#39;t got nothing to hide&quot; but Snowden <em>broke</em> that narrative! That&#39;s the damage, and it&#39;s the most damage that could be done to these guys because for all their supposed whiz-bang gadgetry and super-compute farms, they still can&#39;t break modern crypto, so they need to <em>dupe</em> people into trusting them when they should not be trusting them. Snowden did not reveal - and almost certainly never had access to - info regarding the specific cryptanalytic capabilities of NSA. <em>Those</em> details are the &quot;keys to the kingdom&quot;, nothing else is even close to being as valuable as that. But who cares? All we really need to know is this: <em>Trust the NSA and get screwed</em>. The rest is just details.</p>

<p>They would like the public to believe they can... but, seriously, they cannot. They may have had a breakthrough on RSA 1024 which would compromise a lot of modern cryptosystems, but even &quot;weak&quot; symmetric crypto is effectively impenetrable.

    <div class="md"><p>yeah frankly most americans who use the most popular websites are already using encryption by default. they don&#39;t even know they&#39;re using it, in fact most don&#39;t even know what HTTPS is. and all it takes is one family member or friend to help them out and they&#39;ve got tons of privacy/security features that they won&#39;t even notice. tons of people are also using computers paid for by their company, which often have encryption suites installed.</p>

<p>a couple years ago, when my life was pretty different, i introduced quite a few of my drug dealers to crypto.cat too. some of them were too stupid to put a password on their iphone, yet they could figure out cryptocat. really hope they expand it to an overlay program/app that you can use as a general instant messenger, so that the average person can replace facebook chat with a safe alternative. but as it is right now, it&#39;s perfectly usable by even the dumbest bricks in the country. not that they&#39;d have much to hide, but if everybody starts using it, NSA&#39;s productivity will go down, and perhaps their funding will get cut off.</p>

<p>But this is still good news... every backdoor that is closed is a backdoor that Russian and Chinese hackers and wannabe blackhat script-kiddies no longer have access to.</p>

<p>I think you are right they have better backdoors - namely, they have <em>hardware</em> backdoors. There are a large number of very big computer hardware corporations that are <em>conspicuously</em> absent from any mention in the Snowden documents. Unless we are to believe that NSA&#39;s &quot;gentle persuasion&quot; techniques - e.g. gagging NSLs - only work on Internet and software tech companies but don&#39;t work on hardware tech companies. In other words, there&#39;s a lot more penetration of US companies than Snowden was either willing or able to reveal. And if your CPU is compromised, for example, all the software updates in the world don&#39;t mean shit.</p>

<p>But we gotta start somewhere, and Step One is closing the software vulnerabilities. It is possible to operate even compromised hardware in secure ways, though it&#39;s a lot of hassle. And I think we&#39;re going to see increased market demand for Blackphone-style products.</p>

<p>The real lesson here is that security is not a technological phenomenon. UL rates bank safes in hours... the number of <em>hours</em> required to penetrate the safe given things like thermite cutting torches and roto-hammers. Given unfettered access to any secure system, <a href="https://xkcd.com/538">it can always be broken</a>. This is why security is both a technological <em>and politico-legal</em> phenomenon. Security requires a combination of technical measures and legal protections. Yes, that means that we need to bring back the natural right of the individual to flip the bird to Federal Inquisitors when they demand his password.</p>

<p>Great post, and I enjoyed it. But I&#39;m not worried about them, I&#39;m worried about the NSA, etc. who have input into crypto standards.</p>

<p>I really liked the comparison to physical safes. Companies will go as far as employing multiple vendors firewalls without properly deploying and monitoring tamper detection technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>idk man. if you understood how encryption worked you wouldn&#39;t even be asking that question. the best mathematicians in the world, working together with the best supercomputers in the world, could not break even RSA-4096. private-public key generation equations are based on the best pseudorandomization mathematics in existence right now. they would literally have to violate the laws of mathematics, which is far more fundamental than breaking the laws of physics, to consistently decrypt RSA-4096 or really any other common encryption protocol. at the existing rates on the best supercomputers on the planet it would take hundreds of millions of years. obviously in that time our computing technology will get faster and faster. but because computing will get faster, it will be more reasonable to use much more powerful encryption. unlike computing speed, there aren&#39;t any limits to the depth of an encryption protocol. you can use as many bits as you want... making it exponentially more difficult and slower to decrypt with each one. if our computers get faster, we can use more tedious encryption standards. so really there will never come a time when it&#39;s easier to crack encryption, because the same process that makes it easier to crack also makes it stronger, and thus more difficult to crack.</p>

<p>the idea that there&#39;s some secret hacker mumbo jumbo strategy to break true, sound encryption is only propounded by those who don&#39;t get how it works. when you take a look at the mathematics that make it possible, you realize that it&#39;s based on processes that are extremely difficult for computers <em>or</em> human brains to do efficiently. the difficulty of deriving a private key from a public key, for example, is simply incomprehensible. to someone who understands the underlying math, it&#39;s quite obvious that the only possible way the NSA is going to break the great wall of encryption is by somehow building undetectable or unfixable back doors into everything. they have tried and failed. people were claiming that they did it with android OS a few years ago. it&#39;s funny because android&#39;s source code has always been open. anyone who&#39;s ever looked at it knows that this is a joke.</p>

<p>if you really believe that they can already crack PGP standard encryption protocols, then how do you reconcile the fact that the director of the CIA is begging congress to pass a law that mandates all encryption technology have back doors built into it? if they can already get in, what&#39;s the point of installing back doors? that would only do two things: 1) make the technology more susceptible to hackers, and 2) make people freak the fuck out and cause a political tidal wave against the NSA.</p>

<p>the only reason it would be worth making those two enormous sacrifices would be if it was the <em>only</em> way they can get in. this is supported not just by logic and reason, but by the scientific, mathematical evidence collected by massive amounts of independent, scholarly research on the extremely complex equations that govern virtually all standard encryption protocols today. and let&#39;s also keep in mind that your computer, for example, does not use private/public key encryption. it&#39;s a much sturdier protocol. whereas with private/public key you get a headstart, because it is technically possible to derive the private key from the public key, (although extremely difficult) regular drive encryption leaves you with literally nowhere to begin. there is nothing to derive the key from.</p>

<p>decrypting both protocols requires several supercomputers running brute force attacks. for the private/public key decryption, they would simply be using dictionaries, narrowed down by the known public key. i won&#39;t even pretend to fully understand it, but it is based on the difficulty of calculating the discrete logarithm of a massive elliptic curve on a graph basically. my buddy is involved in writing a steganography suite based on elliptic curve encryption and he actually wrote some of the wikipedia page for it. you can check it out and understand more if you have a better mathematical background than i do. anyway, that&#39;s private/public key encryption. with respect to drive decryption, you&#39;re dealing with totally different protocol, and it&#39;s impossible to tell which one because there are many floating around. if you break down the protocols enough though, most of them rest on these fundamental computing problems that are based on the difficulty of factoring immense numbers. obviously this difficulty decreases as computing power increases, but as computing power increases, the feasible size of the numbers to be factored can increase! so you have a never-ending back and forth. but since the growth of the difficulty can grow exponentially, while the size of transistors is predicted to be logarithmically asymptotic, it will simply get harder and harder to crack encryption as computers get better.</p>

<p>the only way to crack someone&#39;s drive is to start with a dictionary that leaves basically nothing out, because you have nothing from which to derive a set of variable possibilities. in fact, if you apply the encryption deep enough, through an external box that is required to even access the computer BIOS, the adversary won&#39;t even know what language to use lol. indeed there are boxes like this, and many of them give you the choice of using a set with millions of characters, which is why they&#39;re so expensive. the language is totally unique, and features basically any character you can display in HTML5, probably plus more. this means not only is the computing power required to crack the encryption exponentially higher, but there is the possibility that the adversary&#39;s dictionary is missing crucial characters. i&#39;m sure this is unlikely for the NSA, which probably compiles dictionaries for all the products available on the market, but as long as new character lists are developed we can basically play cat and mouse with them. this would certainly throw off more novice hackers, especially if you build the box yourself so that its branding or appearance cannot give away the character set.</p>

<p>that actually gives me a brilliant idea, and i think it&#39;d be a great DIY project. if everybody has their own custom encryption box, each with completely unknown features, it would really change the world.</p>

<p>but yeah this post is getting way out of control. i got way off topic... the point is that the NSA is totally helpless when it comes to encryption. that is why they are begging for congress to effectively ban true encryption. still this shouldn&#39;t be seen as much of a threat for 2 reasons. 1) congress voted earlier this year to cut funding for the NSA project dedicated to building backdoors in consumer encryption products, and 2) even if they did pass such a law, i can&#39;t imagine any scenario where they create a backdoor that is completely impossible to close. if it&#39;s software or BIOS based, you can just add another layer of open source encryption on top. if it&#39;s hardware based, which is more likely, then there must be a hardware fix. there&#39;s really no way they can put a back door into everything without cutting off imports from the rest of the world. even then people could make and sell their own parts.</p>

<p>i also don&#39;t really think edward snowden is part of a conspiracy to trick us. and i&#39;m a pretty paranoid guy. i think he&#39;s completely genuine, honestly. he said himself that he was withholding tons of documents, to show the US government that he was not flagrantly tossing out secret international data. this was supposed to prove that the information he released did not create any substantial risk to national security. it&#39;s possible that a lot of the documents he stole actually did contain vital secrets. it&#39;s also possible that most of them contained inconsequential bureaucratic white noise. we really can&#39;t say for sure but that wouldn&#39;t surprise me. also, understand that he has to analyze and study each document that he plans on releasing, completely alone. if he lets the wrong things out, it could be dangerous, right? and he can&#39;t even have somebody to help him, and split the work in half, because that would be effectively the same as risking the release of half of the documents before they&#39;ve been confirmed safe.</p>

<p>i&#39;m not trying to say that these documents are vital to national security. i&#39;m just saying you kind of have to give him the benefit of the doubt. he&#39;s released a ton of documents already, and frankly i&#39;m shocked that you would claim that they don&#39;t contain any technical or consequential information. that&#39;s just not true... again it sounds like you haven&#39;t even bothered to look at them. you&#39;re just kind of accusing him of blowing smoke when you haven&#39;t even looked at what he&#39;s done. i&#39;ve read a lot of them, spent a ton of time on it in fact, and i still haven&#39;t even seen half of the pages. i seriously doubt that you&#39;ve seen all of them. but i have seen a ton of extremely technical docs, so i don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting this idea that it&#39;s all fluff. i came to a completely different conclusion - but we&#39;re all entitled to our own opinions.</p>

<p>i can&#39;t really see any real motive for doing a puppet show of this scale. it&#39;s one of those things that i can&#39;t prove or disprove. but i think the rationale you gave to support it is reallllyyy shaky. the defense you gave is pretty rooted in your philosophy. i actually admired that you quoted foucault, and i totally see your point, but i don&#39;t see it really relating to whether edward snowden is an agent provocateur. i see that concept active in a thousand other places though, absolutely. i just don&#39;t see snowden as a concession or distraction. but again this is something that can&#39;t be disproven or proven. it basically comes down to my gut feeling about a lot of things. and there&#39;s no use arguing about that. but if throwing edward snowden at us was supposed to help out the surveillance state, it failed miserably. it has made a fuck ton of sheep stop and think about things, honestly...</p>

<p>So, you think something is up with Snowden ? </p>

<p>here&#39;s why you should be skeptical</p>

<p>1) Snowden&#39;s documents.... Told us what they did 20 years ago. Don&#39;t give me this shit about &#39;us having a debate&#39; or &#39;now everyone knows!&#39; ... No, fuck that. Limited hangouts... tell you old stuff, while keeping the good stuff secret</p>

<p>they told us their level 10 stuff, they didnt tell us their level 100 stuff</p>

<p>they tell you they only record all phone calls in afghanistan in the bahamas... yea fucking right. they record them worldwide</p>

<ul>
<li>snowdens doc&#39;s only give us code names of shit. </li>
</ul>

<p>ECHELON told us this 25 years ago, minus code names</p>

<p>2) He was given a fucking 40 minute interview on NBC by Brian williams. case closed. ANYTHING in msm/corporate media.... like NBC.... is there for a reason.</p>

<p>you can ignore everything else, just the fact that they let williams interview him means they want u to know who he is</p>

<p>3) 5% of doc&#39;s released. Greenwald clears every store with the us govt. . wel have to wait 30+ years for all of it to come out</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He won&#39;t even touch on anything that hasn&#39;t already been know for 20+ years. The cutting edge right now is: nanotech, gangstalking, and remote neural monitoring. Do you think that will ever hit the news? No. The chemtrails spray the nanotech into the sky, we breath it in, the satellites can see each human&#39;s specific neural fingerprint, and can be gangstalked if they&#39;re noisemakers, whistleblowers, or dissidents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bottom line of a limited hangout is to feed previously unexposed SECRETS that will stop the public from looking farther. By definition, if Snowden has &quot;the keys to the kingdom,&quot; then we are told &quot;there&#39;s no need to look farther.&quot;</p>

<p>nowden&#39;s files are feeding us an &quot;official history&quot; of what the NSA is up to.</p>

<p>Ellsberg&#39;s Pentagon Papers told us the story of Vietnam -- without mentioning the CIA role in the Phoenix Program.</p>

<p>Ellsberg&#39;s Pentagon Papers &quot;sanitized&quot; the story of Vietnam.</p>

<p>At least <a href="http://scotthorton.org/interviews/2014/08/05/080514-philip-giraldi/">one ex-CIA station chief in 2014 has wondered whether there is an even bigger CIA/NSA &quot;program&quot; that has not been discovered</a>.</p>

<p>What if the entire purpose of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/opinion/the-national-security-agencys-domestic-spying-program.html?_r=0">William Binney&#39;s &quot;there&#39;s-an-NSA-file-on-every-American&quot; NSA program</a> is to detect and identify future targets for a domestic (U.S.) Operation Condor?</p>

<p>What if <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;amp;q=cheney+military+rule&amp;amp;oq=cheney+military+rule&amp;amp;gs_l=serp.3...25470.27692.0.27843.20.9.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.55.serp..20.0.0.YXd7ub5W2no">Cheney&#39;s I&#39;m-making-it-happen &quot;prediction&quot; of &quot;military rule&quot;</a> happens?</p>

<p>What if that &quot;military rule&quot; Pentagon military coup is also accompanied by the NSA&#39;s own Operation Condor: assassinating U.S. judges &amp; writers &amp; professors &amp; musicians &amp; labor leaders &amp; filmmakers &amp; anyone who will create a voice of dissent against a Pentagon takeover?</p>

<p>Then Snowden-as-Ellsberg is simply a logical conclusion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not what Snowden is &quot;revealing&quot;.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s what Snowden is NOT revealing:  the parameters of discourse have been defined for you by Snowden.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not looking farther, because Snowden already &quot;has the keys to the kingdom&quot; you&#39;re told.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the definition of a Limited Hangout.</p>

<p>Beware:  A limited hangout does NOT mean Snowden is aware of his role:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Snowden need not be aware of his role.  He could be a &quot;witting collaborator&quot; or an &quot;unwitting collaborator&quot; or a &quot;partially-witting collaborator&quot;.  </p></li>
<li><p>He is expendable, whether or not he is &quot;witting&quot; and aware of his role.  </p></li>
<li><p>I would expect to see him betrayed spectacularly, or even assassinated, for the purposes of lending his story &quot;authenticity&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>The bottom line of a limited hangout is to feed previously unexposed SECRETS that will stop the public from looking farther.  By definition, if Snowden has &quot;the keys to the kingdom,&quot; then we are told &quot;there&#39;s no need to look farther.&quot;</p></li>

<p>3) Process everything for &quot;topic/content&quot;... discard topics known to be of no interest (e.g. &quot;I broke up with my boyfriend again today&quot;), archive everything else... all of it, forever, along with machine-generated summarization data</p>

<p>4) Model everything - this is the part they&#39;re still working on... the rest is already fait accompli; we&#39;re talking Minority Report, here. Make no mistake, they are working feverishly to implement an AI-driven, Minority Report-style prediction system that will at least be able to detect any unusual activity by all persons simultaneously, in real time and possibly even predict unprecedented actions by individual persons, as depicted in MR. It is my hunch that the R&amp;D for this system is being done in Israel.</p>

The letter included an incriminating audio cassette that they could use to inform the public of his extramarital affairs, which would badly hurt his reputation, being a preacher and all...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the solution to this is <em>widespread use of encryption</em> - we just need to make it too expensive for them to store all encrypted communications for all eternity by encouraging all Internet users to have all their communications encrypted by default. Of course, we can&#39;t really reach Joe Sixpack, but we can reach the software devs that write the software that Joe Sixpack uses... and that&#39;s why the Snowden revelations are so damned important. Sure, Joe Sixpack doesn&#39;t give a hoot in hell about NSA spying because he still thinks &quot;he ain&#39;t got nothing to hide&quot; but that&#39;s irrelevant. What matters is whether the software developers who write the software he uses think that he needs default, always-on, strong encryption on all comm channels. A lot more devs today realize that this is the case, than pre-Snowden. The era of doe-eyed trust in NSA is over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a post lately about the CDC lying about the number of swine flu cases in the US during the outbreak.  They said it was over 60 million people.  This was because the fact was being exposed that the &quot;overwhelming&quot; majority of the tests were coming back from the labs negative so they didn&#39;t know what to do. The best thing they could do was tell a lie so big that it drew attention away from the FACT that the results were negative.  1 in 5 Americans.

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Snowden was not a limited hangout. However, he did not act alone. </p>

<p>Remember, intelligence agencies and secret services are the foremost consumers of privacy and anonymity... NSA&#39;s programs had become so broad in scope that they were actually stomping on other agencies&#39; - who will remain unnamed - turf.</p>

<p>We already know that Snowden did not &quot;reveal it all&quot;, nor could he have, and he has not claimed to. The reason for the selective release of information is that the agencies behind the leaks do not want a &quot;data dump&quot; - after all, they are organs of the US establishment (and possibly some foreign allies of those organs, as well).</p>

<p>The purpose of the leaks has already been served - the scope of NSA&#39;s ambitions is now <em>proven</em> and private security researchers and private security products companies no longer have any excuse that &quot;we don&#39;t need to secure XYZ channel because they wouldn&#39;t care enough to spy on that&quot;. They spy on World of Warcraft in-game messaging, for crissake... there is <em>nothing</em> they do not intend to collect.</p>

<p>One of the biggest hammers in the NSA&#39;s spy-toolbox was just a con-game: duping security researchers and standards bodies (such as IETF and NIST) to believe this fairy tale that &quot;we&#39;re just focused on foreign terrorists, we don&#39;t care about domestic stuff and we don&#39;t care about people&#39;s nudie photos&quot;. This was always false and the Snowden leaks have proved that. Thus, they have served their purpose: that hammer has been destroyed, for good.</p>

<p>The Internet security industry has been permanently scarred... this is a lesson they will never forget. No more Pollyanna-ish assumptions about NSA&#39;s intent to crack hash algorithms, intercept &quot;low-value&quot; communications channels, target domestic communications or security products of domestic companies, no more happy-go-lucky trust of NSA&#39;s input on encryption standards and IETF standards. If NSA says X, that&#39;s a good reason to doubt X is really true. They even have a class on offer in their training catalogue on the art of deception... these are literally professional liars. Never again will we let NSA get on our 6.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, we don&#39;t actually know how many documents Snowden took - he&#39;s never said! The numbers released from NSA have ranged from a few thousand to millions - in other words, NSA has no idea how many documents he took. </p>

<p>Second, Snowden was always up front that this was not a data dump - he hand-picked journalists to deliver the documents to, <em>on condition</em> that they would agree not to release any documents that could harm USG employees or the targets of USG surveillance, especially innocent targets.</p>

<p>I followed the Snowden story blow by blow as it developed, starting from Sep. 5th, 2013 when the BULLRUN program was revealed - prior to September 2013, the Snowden revelations had been rather pedestrian and just confirmations of things we already knew. But BULLRUN got to the heart of the matter: NSA&#39;s mission and goal is to subvert Internet security and render all non-USG communications - including those of private US citizens - plaintext to the eyes of NSA.</p>

<p>Since they can&#39;t crack widely-available, state-of-the-art encryption, this means subverting encryption before it&#39;s applied, either by corrupting the encryption standards, corrupting encryption software (implementation), snarfing channel keys or backdooring the local machine on which the encryption is being performed. Only the most paranoid among us (such as me!) suspected that this was what NSA was doing all along, but the BULLRUN revelations did two very important things: 1) it proved that <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/on-nsa.html">even the most paranoid people had not been paranoid enough</a> [a] and 2) it branded the minds of the Internet security industry forever with the dictum they should always have been following all along: <em>trust the NSA and get screwed</em>.</p>

<p>Snowden was and is the NSA&#39;s worst nightmare. The agency of your namesake is my first suspect, but who knows. Maybe it really was the Russians. :)</p>

<p>[a] &quot;After all, if I got quoted sounding too much like an NSA conspiracy nut, my colleagues would laugh at me. Then I might not get invited to the cool security parties. ... Not only does the worst possible hypothetical I discussed appear to be true, but it&#39;s true on a scale I couldn&#39;t even imagine. I&#39;m no longer the crank. I wasn&#39;t even close to cranky enough.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I stand somewhat corrected - I had not heard that interview of GG before. In any case, I think the premise of cryptome&#39;s claim - that it will take &quot;42 years&quot; for the Snowden leaks to be complete - is flawed. Snowden released the documents <em>on condition</em> that the reporters he entrusted them to would not reveal names of individual USG employees or the targets of NSA surveillace, innocent or otherwise. He also placed other restrictions on the use of the documents as a condition for their release. The documents which have not met the condition for release will <em>never</em> be released... not in 42 years, not ever. Whether you or I like it or not, <em>those</em> are the conditions under which the leaker chose to release his documents. I don&#39;t see what all the grousing and complaining is about.</p>

<p>Well, they are different and competing power centers, that&#39;s for sure. People often say to me - naively - &quot;but don&#39;t they both answer to the President?&quot; to which I ask how many Presidents does the average lifer in an intel bureau work through? A Federal bureaucrat retiring in late 2009 a year after Obama took office could have served under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Let&#39;s see, that would be Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, Bush II and Obama. So, this idea that &quot;the bureaucracies answer to the President&quot; is hopelessly naive.</p>

<p>In my view, both the CIA and NSA are formidable power centers that align with different national and international interests. And the power of the NSA has been growing exponentially over the last 3 decades, with the rise of the personal computer and the Internet basically funneling exabytes of data right into their hands. I am inclined to agree with you that the CIA is still more powerful than the NSA but I think that the power ratio has shifted... they are not as much more powerful than the NSA today as they used to be 3 decades ago, and I don&#39;t think they like that.</p>

<p>So. The idea [as I get it] of a limited hangout is to tell people a thing that they might not; probably not, understand. If it&#39;s a limited hangout, if it&#39;s intentionally leaked [another part of limited hangout as I understand]. It&#39;s also tech from two to four decads ago. Meaning in the 70s/80s the US was doing what Snowden&#39;s limited hangout is implying. I&#39;m saying if that&#39;s true and this is a LH we&#39;re fucked. If they had that tech decades ago, encryption no longer holds them at bay for anything they actually want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the solution to this is <em>widespread use of encryption</em> - we just need to make it too expensive for them to store all encrypted communications for all eternity by encouraging all Internet users to have all their communications encrypted by default. Of course, we can&#39;t really reach Joe Sixpack, but we can reach the software devs that write the software that Joe Sixpack uses... and that&#39;s why the Snowden revelations are so damned important. Sure, Joe Sixpack doesn&#39;t give a hoot in hell about NSA spying because he still thinks &quot;he ain&#39;t got nothing to hide&quot; but that&#39;s irrelevant. What matters is whether the software developers who write the software he uses think that he needs default, always-on, strong encryption on all comm channels. A lot more devs today realize that this is the case, than pre-Snowden. The era of doe-eyed trust in NSA is over.</p>

<p>Great post, and I enjoyed it. But I&#39;m not worried about them, I&#39;m worried about the NSA, etc. who have input into crypto standards.</p>

<p>I really liked the comparison to physical safes. Companies will go as far as employing multiple vendors firewalls without properly deploying and monitoring tamper detection technology.</p>
