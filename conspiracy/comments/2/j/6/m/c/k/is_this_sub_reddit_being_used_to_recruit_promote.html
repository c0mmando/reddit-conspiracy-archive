<p>The Nazi government gave it&#39;s army film cameras to take to the front where fascists army personal were encouraged to take footage of their crimes, killing and hanging civilians etc. </p>

<p>Making the crimes of the NAZIs some of the most well documented in the history of mankind. </p>

<p>Some readers of this will say &quot;well people should be allowed to post any conspiracy theories here&quot; well i claim it is a conspiracy of Neo Nazis trying to recruit sympathy on this sub reddit by posting their bullshit here. </p>

<p>The conspiracy sub reddit for me is very useful in informing me to some of the corruption going on now and allows me to filter the bullshit of the MSM, i&#39;d hate to see this sub reddit ruined by Neo Nazis and hiter lovers and racists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I was a liberal -- voted for Obama the first time -- before I figured out what the government is up to. Government is literally controlled by corporations and bankers. They start wars and finance both sides, killing thousands to make a profit and/or improve their own strategic position. Israel is using Gaza as some kind of test lab for human oppression, then exporting the techniques and weapons to the US and other countries&#39; governments via police training. </p>

<p>No, police are not there for your safety! They are there to control you, to dominate you. That is their role, and in many police forces around the country, they have been trained as such by Israeli training schools. And many police forces are actively involved in running drugs. And you flat out perform highway robbery with your asinine asset forfeiture laws. We know it. You know it. You&#39;re a bunch of goddamn criminals. But I digress.</p>

<p>So it turns out these same asshole bankers are in charge of the corporate media. The same corporate media that lied to us about 9/11, JFK, Iraq War, Afghanistan War, Vietnam War, Monsanto... They essentially own public education, too, so we&#39;re never taught about things such as the role of private bankers in starting wars to spread the use of their fiat currency. They run most of TV networks and dominate the music industry. They even spread their propaganda through churches. And perhaps most insidiously, they hire shills to steer the narrative online, on what is supposed to be a free and open exchange of ideas. (And yeah they killed Aaron Swartz.) They have most Americans captive within an artificial reality, where they think a bunch of muslims with box cutters knocked down 3 towers with 2 planes. Most Americans don&#39;t question this, and they chant for war against innocent people. Good people, cheering on the slaughter of children. We have been made their slaves.</p>

<p>The elite bankers can literally dictate culture, and that is scary because they are abusing that power badly. Boy do I feel stupid for ever trusting our government <strong>and</strong> trusting our &quot;news&quot;. I actually thought I was getting a wide variety of news by watching CNN, BBC, and the occasional FoxNews for teh luls. Sure, I was getting two political sides of a false reality. Nice one there, Illuminati shitheads! </p>

<p>The only thing we can count on them for is to deceive us for their own benefit and our detriment. (Want to know how the very rich get very rich while the rest of us don&#39;t? This is how.) It actually makes them fairly predictable: They will lie when it benefits them. They are consistent in this.</p>

<p>So why is it so preposterous to question whether a consistently dishonest source, proven to be dishonest on history ranging from the US Civil War to the as-yet failed coup in Syria.. might be being dishonest about WW2? There is evidence that much of the media was manufactured, and they had the means, motive, and opportunity.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say for sure what happened in WW2 because I wasn&#39;t there. But I, for one, will never take these assholes at their word for as long as I live.</p>

<p>Seek independent news. Dig hard, dig deep for our real history. I suspect it&#39;s more amazing than they&#39;re letting on. Oh and fuck Nazis and all sociopaths. And Illuminati shitheads.</p>

<p>edit: As I was saying: <a href="http://redd.it/2j7041">http://redd.it/2j7041</a> Sketchy as fuck. Healthy skepticism is warranted.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Really? How did the Nazis benefit from documenting their &quot;crimes, killing and hanging civilians&quot;. Did Goebbels use those films in his propaganda? </p>

<p>So if &quot;this filming made crimes of the Nazis some of the most well documented in the history of mankind&quot;, where is this material now? The internet should be full of videos of Nazis making themselves look bad killing and hanging innocent civilians. If allied propagandists were more than happy to flood the market with films of piles of naked bodies of typhus victims of Bergen-Belsen and Buchenwald bulldozed to mass graves, they surely would not sit on better, directly incriminating material that should have been presented at Nuremberg.</p>

<p>Sources and links?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve not seen you in here. Doesn&#39;t mean you haven&#39;t been here.</p>

<p>In the Oklahoma bombing there was a woman that pulled up short, seeing people and faces that she didn&#39;t recognize. These strange faces were as white as she was. Her intuition is haunting.</p>

<p>In the Oklahoma bombing there was a black man that did a massive gut check and he was tortured to death.</p>

<p>Each of these persons were dedicated to family, community, co-workers, their jobs. </p>

<p>Nazi, Neo Nazis: Do you have a firm definition in your mind as it relates to these Boogie Men?</p>

<p>So your take away from the Oklahoma bombing was Neo Nazi White Skin Head KKK&#39;s because that is what MSM told you, right?</p>

<p>You go research the Oklahoma bombing. Dig. Dig hard.</p>

<p>I&#39;m old and running out of time: A Nazi can be a  Black Leader that rolls into Ferguson and starts fires. A Nazi can be a white skinned man that concentrates a people into a ghetto and demands that <em>Christian America</em> send them more money, more armament! A Nazi can be a Mulatto figure head. </p>

<p>A Nazi might be you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not asserting any sympathy. I have answered your question.  Your snap judgements and slander have an irony I think you are missing. What is a nazi sympathizer to you and what sympathetic opinions have I expressed? Is pointing out your weak argument a nazi trait? Questioning the official narrative and sympathizing with violent ideologies are different things. I am guilty if divergent thought for sure but to make the leap that I sympathize with a nearly century old political movement which I am fairly certain neither if us is familiar with enough to fully understand is a bit presumptuous.</p>
