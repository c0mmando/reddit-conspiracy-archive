    <div class="md"><p>Why is a distraction necessary, and what makes you think that it&#39;s working? </p>

<p>Do you believe that without Ebola, the American people would stand with one voice to oppose military action against Iran or any other country? It seems like most people either don&#39;t care, or generally support the military. If the government wanted to go to war with Iran, they could make up any reason and just do it. They don&#39;t need to divert anyone&#39;s attention. People are still reporting on Iran every day, either professional journalists or bloggers or people on twitter.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why the US government would need to distract people, and if they do they aren&#39;t doing a very good job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I do think Ebola is a legitimate concern, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong about the other things mentioned. The U.S. has had its sights set on Iran for some time now, for a number of reasons, namely its resources and geostrategic location. That&#39;s going to be useful when things come to a head with Russia and/or China.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iran and Syria have a mutual defense agreement. Watch - we won&#39;t shift to Assad and Iran engages with ISIS. Then, they will can&#39;t just double back and fight the US and ISIS. They&#39;ll have to just sit.</p>

<p>Once Assad falls, Iran will be the only one left. The plan originally was most likely to have Russia distracted with Ukraine, but it looks like Putin is diploing that one up as well.</p>

<p>We were supposed to sell EU our newly acquired gas fields via pipelines being setup to take a chunk of Russia&#39;s exports, but it may still be foiled. This is certainly being more clear IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ebola is so great, it&#39;s a break from the normal State Department bullshit. I mean what do you think of when you hear Ebola. Fucking PERFECT. Ebola is so scary and all the scary is already built in you don&#39;t have to make little news pieces about how Ebola is raping 14 year old girls everyone is already scared of Ebola. </p>

<p>So what happens when we send 3k or 4k troops over to Liberia? No one cares, Ebola is better than ISIL cause you can send guys over with a shit ton of guns and no one even asks- Hey you gonna use those m16s to shoot Ebloa?
And guess what Liberia has besides Ebola, OIL. So who controls the oil in Liberia you may ask? National Oil Company of Liberia who happened to be located in Monrovia and who are just now opening a new round of bidding for offshore drilling. </p>

<p>All these plays are meant to grab a big part of the European energy market away from Russia and cement  the US a the dominant force in the western world. Ukraine, lifting the ban on LNG exports, pipelines in Syria and Iraq, dividing up the African oil fields to coalition partners.  Meanwhile  the protest in Hong Kong is looking more and more like  the old State Department trick and the Pacific fleet is going HAM on the military exercise with South Korea and Japan while bureaucrats hammer our a trade deal. </p>

<p>This is the New American Century alright. </p>
