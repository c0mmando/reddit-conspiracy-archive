       So,  i believe that the Illuminati exist. They created ebola and caused 911. But I have a question.  If I watch these conspiracy vids, the clues leading to the illu proof is so obvious.  Why is it so obvious? I mean,  the illu has got experts all over the pace,  how could they make such dumb mistakes? Or is this part of their manipulation? Let me know what you guys think.

       People who believe in the modern Illuminati say several things:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's conditioning or bragging.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's communication to other members or shadowy societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's probably a couple more reasons people think it happens.

       All symbols used by the luciferians (eye, pyramid, obelisk, pentagram, skull, circle + x in it, etc) are shared openly for two reasons. First, it is to show us what they control, this is mandated by their contract on earth. Secondly, they do it to give the images energy. The more conscious energy that is put into a symbol, the more powerful thought-forms are created in ritual.

       Illuminati are convenient disinfo for the real Zionist long term Great Work conspiracy. Their place is not on the floating eye part of the pyramid.

       edit: btw, you can't assess whether power uses zionism as a tool to dilute and occlude their responsability into a larger godly plan (which it could ditch tomorrow if a better scheme comes up), or as a true believed ideology. Could be either.

       Well the Illuminati get all the conspiracy "publicity" and even occasional mainstream mention, criticism of Israel and Zionism in the mainstream is not tolerated or printed. Anyone who does so gets labeled anti-Semitic, and neither political party dares to go against AIPAC or speak against Israel's human rights abuses, the politicians are only allowed to lick the Israeli boot.

       Let's put it this way, if i was a knower looking to protect my source of power (be it illusionism, sacred texts &amp; relics, money printing ...), i would definitely create a buffer race/cast of believers to help me protect and expand my power, exploiting in the process the loyalty of blood. I would have done that today or 5 centuries before Christ, just like some did ;)

       Think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Ignorance is a bliss"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't dive into conspiracies, you lead a happy, ignorant life.
      </p>
      <p>
       You start uncovering some truth, you see the total control if the media, the us, the wealth, the world.. You learn most to all of what you worked so hard for means literally nothing, the history you've learned tainted beyond logical belief.. Things that big strike paranoia in our minds considering we've been living in what the rest of the world sees as a movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing "The truth" is certainly no bliss. I'm sure they want us to know so that we realize how small we actually are. They know they can silence just one or a small group, so if you want to be heard, you have to unite, but most people aren't ready to let everything go and bathe in ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they just continue on with their day (aka distractions).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's literally way to simple,
       <strong>
        Come together, as one, you would be astounded at the power you then hold

       I would suggest that focusing your energies locally (yourself, then family, then close friends and neighbors) is a far more pressing priority. Build up your social networks - you're going to need it.

       Yes i do. Loads of people do. The US government own a patent on Ebola... I dont know, but how come Americans get cured, but the cure cant be released for africans? And there is a video of a infected US doctor who got transported by plane to another hospital. She was assisted by 3 men in those sealed costumes,  but then there was a man completely uncovered helping her too... This proves it is not infectious. In fact,  the people in africa get infected by vaccinations. If it was natural and spreading by body fluids etc. then why arent loads of people infected? Why only a few thousand? If it was infectious, the disease should spread exponentally.  Since the outbreak in december, there should be millions infected right now, especially in the poor conditions in Africa. It is clear to me. Im not trying to convince you. Do your own research but please do not instantly believe everything the government and media says.

       Don't forget which sub you're posting in, I'm pretty sure most of the people here already know the government and media is not to always be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know enough about ebola or infectious diseases to claim that I know how to expect or predict the rate they should be spreading, and I don't think that you really do either. It's possible the current outbreak could have been intentionally started, it's also possible that it is being largely exaggerated and that some cases may be staged entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have already heard every fact that you've mentioned about this myself, either from this sub or on youtube. Whenever a major event is reported in the news there are always new theories that come up about them, some may be right but most are not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am almost always skeptical of what is coming in on the mainstream news, but you need to realize that it is important to be equally skeptical from information you come across on the internet and in youtube videos. There is certainly disinformation put out online, both by professional liars like on the mainstream news but also by people who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about whatsoever, and choose to see a conspiracy in every single aspect of life or are just looking for attention from others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing your own research is important, but please don't instantly believe everything you find online.

       Doesn't that help deflect the finger pointing? If it's so obvious, it makes people think it can't really be them. Hiding in plain sight, if you believe that sort of thing.

       edit: btw, you can't assess whether power uses zionism as a tool to dilute and occlude their responsability into a larger godly plan (which it could ditch tomorrow if a better scheme comes up), or as a true believed ideology. Could be either.

       I would suggest that focusing your energies locally (yourself, then family, then close friends and neighbors) is a far more pressing priority. Build up your social networks - you're going to need it.

       Alternative forms of communication arise. They always do.
