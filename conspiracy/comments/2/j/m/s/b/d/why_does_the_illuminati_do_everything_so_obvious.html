If I watch these conspiracy vids, the clues leading to the illu proof is so obvious.  Why is it so obvious? I mean,  the illu has got experts all over the pace,  how could they make such dumb mistakes? Or is this part of their manipulation? Let me know what you guys think. </p>

First, it is to show us what they control, this is mandated by their contract on earth. Secondly, they do it to give the images energy. The more conscious energy that is put into a symbol, the more powerful thought-forms are created in ritual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it. </p>

<p><em>&quot;Ignorance is a bliss&quot;</em></p>

<p>You don&#39;t dive into conspiracies, you lead a happy, ignorant life.</p>

<p>You start uncovering some truth, you see the total control if the media, the us, the wealth, the world.. You learn most to all of what you worked so hard for means literally nothing, the history you&#39;ve learned tainted beyond logical belief.. Things that big strike paranoia in our minds considering we&#39;ve been living in what the rest of the world sees as a movie.</p>

<p>Knowing &quot;The truth&quot; is certainly no bliss. I&#39;m sure they want us to know so that we realize how small we actually are. They know they can silence just one or a small group, so if you want to be heard, you have to unite, but most people aren&#39;t ready to let everything go and bathe in ridicule. </p>

<p>So they just continue on with their day (aka distractions).</p>

<p>It&#39;s literally way to simple, <strong>Come together, as one, you would be astounded at the power you then hold</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes i do. Loads of people do. The US government own a patent on Ebola... I dont know, but how come Americans get cured, but the cure cant be released for africans? And there is a video of a infected US doctor who got transported by plane to another hospital.

In fact,  the people in africa get infected by vaccinations. If it was natural and spreading by body fluids etc. then why arent loads of people infected? Why only a few thousand? If it was infectious, the disease should spread exponentally.  Since the outbreak in december, there should be millions infected right now, especially in the poor conditions in Africa.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget which sub you&#39;re posting in, I&#39;m pretty sure most of the people here already know the government and media is not to always be trusted.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about ebola or infectious diseases to claim that I know how to expect or predict the rate they should be spreading, and I don&#39;t think that you really do either. It&#39;s possible the current outbreak could have been intentionally started, it&#39;s also possible that it is being largely exaggerated and that some cases may be staged entirely. </p>

<p>I have already heard every fact that you&#39;ve mentioned about this myself, either from this sub or on youtube. Whenever a major event is reported in the news there are always new theories that come up about them, some may be right but most are not at all. </p>

<p>I am almost always skeptical of what is coming in on the mainstream news, but you need to realize that it is important to be equally skeptical from information you come across on the internet and in youtube videos. There is certainly disinformation put out online, both by professional liars like on the mainstream news but also by people who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about whatsoever, and choose to see a conspiracy in every single aspect of life or are just looking for attention from others.</p>

<p>Doing your own research is important, but please don&#39;t instantly believe everything you find online.</p>
