       It was supposed to contain a list of Americans being spied on by the NSA.

       He ended up naming 5 people.

       That was it? That is nothing to fuss over. Jesus. I thought it was going to be something more than that. It was pretty safe to guess that many Muslims were being spied on anyways.

       One thing to remember is that these 5 now have pending lawsuits against the Federal government. So while it may not seem like the biggest deal, and while the courts may be rigged against them from the start, the fact is that these illicit surveillance programs will have to face scrutiny in a court of law. Kind of important.

       Naming everyone or a big list was probably seen by Glenn as invading their privacy. I'm pretty sure he got permission from the people he named before publicly naming them.

       Yeah and even then he confirmed with the government to verify it.

       My guess is there was more to the story and they were able to pressure him into not publishing what he was going to let out.

       Most of what he has come out with has been disappointing to me. Not much of it was not highly suspected or leaked previously. The only new thing is power points.
      </p>

       Also the way he is doing it and pushing his book and the guy who funded first look. All of it just seems odd.

       Glenn Greenwald signed a contract with a subsidiary of Sony. Yeah, his "street cred" is over. Asking permission from the government to publish something is little more than a formal acknowledgement of something already known.

       It is documented that lots of people were spied on. Just about anyone involved in Occupy or who goes to political type meetings. All of those people would be suspect, and their friends, etc.

      <p>
       I recently saw a number that it was up to over 1 million people in the US of A who were under this sort of surveillance. I know I was. Some of the signs of it were terribly obvious.

       But, if we look things from a different perspective...
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden said the NSA are actively trading naked pictures from their database. A week or two we later the Fapception occurred. Also sometime in that period we learn of a "second" whistleblower. I'm of the opinion that we're seeing Snowden leaks done in a less obvious manner instead of straight from Greenwald. Or I could be completely off base on this. Either or, we live in interesting times where people are beginning to truth seek...

       I have been documenting what it is like as a US citizen to be under their damaging surveillance since 2004.

       I'm sure he and I have argued about it at one point or another, he would consider me radical and unproven. I do remember being very frustrated with him on more than one occasion about how completely clueless he seemed to be about the whole situation.
