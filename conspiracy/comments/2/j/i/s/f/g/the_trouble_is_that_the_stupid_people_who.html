       In Mark Twain's day, newspapers were the popular mass media. They shaped public opinion. The difference is, they were not controlled by a small alien group. There were numerous independent newspapers, and to a large extent they were owned by white Christians (the population of the US was largely made up of white Christians). Today, television and other forms of mass media are owned by a small number of corporations, and they are run and controlled by wealthy Jews.

       The Greeks had an 80/20 rule: 80% of the population is just plain stupid. Not incapable of learning, just uninterested in making any effort at it - easier to have a newspaperman or Sean Hannity or Jon Stewart think for you.

       I agree. The internet has awaken a lot of people to the corruption of government and corporations. It has also caused a lot of people to get involved. But...there is also a ton of

       The trick is learning how to differentiate one from the other. This can be done the slow way, with hours and hours of experience, or the faster way which it to fact check the information and research the reliability of the site and person producing the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means we should simply be doing our due-diligence and we should do that no matter what medium is used to get information. Be it network television, cable television, satellite, newspapers or the internet.

      <p>
       Science is not always a sure bet on truth. By it's very nature the profession of science results in scientists that or either wealthy or just making a living. This means that many scientists can and have manipulated results if the money is right and they are in dire financial straits. Even peer reviewed results can be corrupted if the agenda is important enough to the right parties. This is exactly the problem I have with Climate Change. The government and some of the 0.01% stand to gain far too much if Climate Change can be proven a fact. So I have to doubt any science if the grants the scientists are receiving are coming from the government or select corporations.

       Not too many years ago, the Internet was a free forum of ideas, and it was run by geeks and nerds who valued freedom of speech. Increasingly, the Internet is coming under the control of big money Jews, just as all the other mass media is controlled by big money Jews. This is making the Internet more like other forms of mass media -- vapid propaganda, where genuinely free voices (such as mine) are maliciously suppressed.

       As a physicist, no. I actually don't "believe" anything because of how toxic that whole area is in discussion. I just go with the scientific papers and studies and side with those (which, again, I wouldn't call "belief").

       So you admit that you do no due diligence and "just go with the scientific papers and studies and side with those"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize how incredibly moronic that is?  And by the way, nobody cares that you are a "physicist".  A title is meaningless and if you think that anyone should bow down to your great scientific proficiency because you call yourself a "physicist", then you clearly do not understand your profession by nature of your argument from authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's garbage thinking no matter what you call yourself.  Address the ideas with facts and do not be swayed by the surrounding sophistry.

       The topic can get toxic, agreed. The toxicity stems from the emotional attachment people have to their own theories or the sources of those theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       To remain honest, none of us can know what actually transpired beyond witnessing the results and drawing our own conclusions. But if history is any guide, we can be reasonably certain the-powers-that-be are certainly being less than forthright about their version of events.

       The trick is to not back any side and be willing to change one's opinion as research and learning indicates.

       The mainstream media is in the hands of a very few people.  They have an agenda.  There is good information, but much more misinformation and disinformation, as they promote propaganda in the form of "news" and entertainment to line their pockets.  Highly paid actors read their lines off the tpt to convince you that what is being reported is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  The only dissenting views are controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet is owned by the users.  There is good information, as well as misinformation and disinformation, but you have access to other sources to help in determining.
