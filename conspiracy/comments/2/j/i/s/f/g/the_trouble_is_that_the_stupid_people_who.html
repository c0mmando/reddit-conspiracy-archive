    <div class="md"><p>In Mark Twain&#39;s day, newspapers were the popular mass media. They shaped public opinion. The difference is, they were not controlled by a small alien group. There were numerous independent newspapers, and to a large extent they were owned by white Christians (the population of the US was largely made up of white Christians). Today, television and other forms of mass media are owned by a small number of corporations, and they are run and controlled by wealthy Jews.</p>

<p>I agree. The internet has awaken a lot of people to the corruption of government and corporations. It has also caused a lot of people to get involved. But...there is also a ton of <strong>B</strong>ravo <strong>S</strong>ierra on the internet. </p>

<p>The trick is learning how to differentiate one from the other. This can be done the slow way, with hours and hours of experience, or the faster way which it to fact check the information and research the reliability of the site and person producing the information. </p>

<p>That means we should simply be doing our due-diligence and we should do that no matter what medium is used to get information. Be it network television, cable television, satellite, newspapers or the internet. </p>

<p>Science is not always a sure bet on truth. By it&#39;s very nature the profession of science results in scientists that or either wealthy or just making a living. This means that many scientists can and have manipulated results if the money is right and they are in dire financial straits. Even peer reviewed results can be corrupted if the agenda is important enough to the right parties. This is exactly the problem I have with Climate Change. The government and some of the 0.01% stand to gain far too much if Climate Change can be proven a fact. So I have to doubt any science if the grants the scientists are receiving are coming from the government or select corporations.  </p>

<p>Not too many years ago, the Internet was a free forum of ideas, and it was run by geeks and nerds who valued freedom of speech. Increasingly, the Internet is coming under the control of big money Jews, just as all the other mass media is controlled by big money Jews. This is making the Internet more like other forms of mass media -- vapid propaganda, where genuinely free voices (such as mine) are maliciously suppressed.</p>

<p>So you admit that you do no due diligence and &quot;just go with the scientific papers and studies and side with those&quot;?</p>

<p>Do you realize how incredibly moronic that is?  And by the way, nobody cares that you are a &quot;physicist&quot;.  A title is meaningless and if you think that anyone should bow down to your great scientific proficiency because you call yourself a &quot;physicist&quot;, then you clearly do not understand your profession by nature of your argument from authority.</p>

<p>It&#39;s garbage thinking no matter what you call yourself.  Address the ideas with facts and do not be swayed by the surrounding sophistry.</p>
