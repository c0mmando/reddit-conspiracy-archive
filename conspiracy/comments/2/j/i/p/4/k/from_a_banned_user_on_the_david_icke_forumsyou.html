<p>JEWISH CHILD PORN / SNUFF FILM RING DISCOVERED</p>

<p>NOTE: According to the Talmudic En-cyclopedia: &#39;He who has carnal knowledge of the wife of a Gentile is not liable to the death penalty, for it is written: &quot;thy fellow&#39;s wife&quot; rather than the alien&#39;s wife; and even the precept that a man &quot;shall cleave unto his wife&quot; which is addressed to the Gentiles does not apply to a Jew, just there is no matrimony for a heathen; and al-though a married Gentile woman is forbidden to the Gentiles, in any case a Jew is exemp-ted.&#39; This does not imply that sexual inter-course between a Jewish man and a Gentile woman is permitted - quite the contrary. But the main punishment is inflicted on the Gentile woman; she must be executed, even if she was raped by the Jew: &#39;If a Jew has coitus with a Gentile woman, whether she be a child of three or an adult, whether married or unmar-ried, and even if he is a minor aged only nine years and one day - because he had willful coitus with her, she must be killed, as is the case with a beast, because through her a Jew got into trouble. The Jew, however, must be flogged, and if he is a Kohen (member of the priestly tribe) he must receive double the number of lashes, because he has committed a double offense: a Kohen must not have inter-course with a prostitute, and all Gentile wo-men are presumed to be prostitutes. - Israel Shahak, Jewish History, Jewish Religion, Pluto Press, London 1994, page 87</p>

<p>Rome, Italy -- Italian and Russian police, working together, broke up a ring of Jewish gangsters who had been involved in the manufacture of child rape and snuff pornography.</p>

<p>Three Russian Jews and eight Italian Jews were arrested after police discovered they had been kidnapping non-Jewish children between the ages of two and five years old from Russian orphanges, raping the children, and then murdering them on film. Mostly non-Jewish customers, including 1700 nationwide, 600 in Italy, and and unknown number in the United States, paid as much as $20,000 per film to watch little children being raped and murdered.</p>

<p>Jewish officials in a major Italian news agency tried to cover the story up, but were circumvented by Italisn news reporters, who broadcasts scenes from the films live at prime time on Italisn television to more than 11 million Italian viewers. Jewish officials then fired the executives responsible, claiming they were spreading &quot;blood libel.&quot;</p>

<p>Throughout history, various groups have accused sects of Jews of ritually murdering small children. One such account, that of Hugh of Lincoln, led to the expulsion of all Jews from Britain in the 13th Century. Such accounts have generally been discounted, but are so wide spread that Jewish organizations have developed a name for them -- &quot;blood libel&quot;.</p>

<p>The American group the ADL was founded to defend a Jew, Leo Frank, accused of raping and murdering a five year old girl, Mary Fagan, in his Atlanta pencil factory in 1913. The ADL claims he was innocent. A mob lynched him after the governor commuted his death sentence to life in prison.</p>

<p>Though AP and Reuters both ran stories on the episode, US media conglomerates refused to carry the story on television news, again saying the story would prejudice Americans against Jews.</p>

<p>Jewish gangsters in Russia have become increasingly linked to traffic in &quot;white slaves&quot; and prostitutes through Israel, according to a recent report in the Jerusalem Post. Israel turns an official blind eye to forced prostitution, and does not punish Israeli citizens who choose to own &quot;sex slaves&quot;, as long as the slaves are foreign and non-Jews.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/01/ameliagentleman.philipwillan">British link to &#39;snuff&#39; videos</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Britain is a key link in the biggest ever international investigation into the production and supply of paedophile &#39;snuff&#39; movies - in which children are murdered on film - an Observer investigation can reveal.</p>

<p>The key suspect in the inquiry, a Russian who was arrested last week in Moscow for distribution of thousands of sadistic child porn videos and pictures, was traced following the seizure of his products from British paedophiles.</p>

<p>Dmitri Vladimirovich Kuznetsov, a 30-year-old former car mechanic in Moscow, was identified after British Customs and police traced the origin of violent child porn videos found in the UK back to Russia.</p>

<p>Last week Italian police seized 3,000 of Kuznetsov&#39;s videos on their way to clients in Italy, sparking an international hunt for paedophiles who have bought his products. The Italian investigators say the material includes footage of children dying during abuse. Prosecutors in Naples are considering charging those who have bought the videos with complicity in murder. They say some may have specifically requested films of killings. </p>

<p>I saw that the Guardian link the OP posted was not functioning, so I did a google search for </p>

<p><strong>italy snuff child russian</strong></p>

<p>The VERY FIRST link that poped up was the Guardian article I linked to. </p>

<p>Here is the link to the Guardian article:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/01/ameliagentleman.philipwillan">http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/01/ameliagentleman.philipwillan</a></p>

<p>Here is the link that the OP posted</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/oc...n.philipwillan">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/oc...n.philipwillan</a></p>

<p><strong>it is the same link</strong> but for some reason part of the URL didn&#39;t show up when the OP posted it:</p>

<p><strong>t/01/ameliagentlema</strong> was missing.</p>

<p>I have made no claims regarding the validity of the material the OP posted. </p>

<p><strong>ALL I DID WAS DISCOVER THE ARTICLE</strong>, which is clearly the one the OP intended to link to.</p>

<p>Ah, but they are. The Guardian story I linked to was the same one that the OP tried to link to. Compare:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/oc...n.philipwillan">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/oc...n.philipwillan</a></p>

<p>You and others whined that there was no source. I provided a working link to the story that the OP intended to link to.</p>

<p><a href="/u/qmechan">/u/qmechan</a> then proceeded to raise non-issues in an attempt to further discredit the OP&#39;s claims (attacking Israel Shahak), and with a few more google searches, I shot him down as well.</p>

<p><strong>I have not implied that everything the OP said was valid</strong>, but I did find the story, and I did deconstruct <a href="/u/qmechan">/u/qmechan</a>&#39;s ad hominem attacks against Shahak.</p>

<p>Were the people guilty REALLY JEWS? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily important, but if you&#39;d like, I&#39;ll search further.</p>

<p>Is that really what you want?</p>

<p>Very true - but even if they were, it would be highly irregular for the Guardian to sat that, wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>B) The OP referenced <strong>Israel Shahak</strong>, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He did?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who doesn&#39;t have a lot of credibility with most of the Jewish establishment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the same can be said for many people. Let&#39;s see whether mentioning Shahak is relevant to your complaint, shall we?</p>

<p>OP&#39;s quote said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jew, however, must be flogged, and if he is a Kohen (member of the priestly tribe) he must receive double the number of lashes, because he has committed a double offense: a Kohen must not have inter-course with a prostitute, and all Gentile wo-men are presumed to be prostitutes. - <strong>Israel Shahak, Jewish History, Jewish Religion, Pluto Press, London 1994, page 87</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this has any bearing on the matter at hand, but since you seem to think it&#39;s a &quot;smoking gun&quot;, I did a google search and what do you know, the book is on line in PDF:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iamthewitness.com/books/Israel.Shahak/Jewish.History.Jewish%20Religion-The.Weight.of.Three.Thousand.Years.pdf">http://www.iamthewitness.com/books/Israel.Shahak/Jewish.History.Jewish%20Religion-The.Weight.of.Three.Thousand.Years.pdf</a></p>

<p>This appears to be the relevant quote: (Page 74 of the PDF)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This does not imply that sexual intercourse between a Jewish man and a Gentile
woman is permitted - quite the contrary. But the main punishment is inflicted on the
Gentile woman; she must be executed, even if she was raped by the Jew: &#39;If a Jew has
coitus with a Gentile woman, whether she be a child of three or an adult, whether
married or unmarried, and even if he is a minor aged only nine years and one day -
because he had willful coitus with her, she must be killed, as is the case with a beast,
because through her a Jew got into trouble&#39; (45) The Jew, however, must be flogged,
and if he is a Kohen (member of the priestly tribe) he must receive double the
number of lashes, because he has committed a [88] double offense: a Kohen must not have intercourse with a prostitute, and all Gentile women are presumed to be prostitutes. <strong>(46)</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m still failing to see how you think the Shahak reference proves that the whole thing is bunk, but we do see that Shahak made a reference here, so we might as well follow up and see whether Shahak is full of shit... no?</p>

<p>Following the aforementioned reference <strong>(46)</strong> we find:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>46
<strong>Maimonides</strong>, op. cit., ibid., 12, 1-3.
As
a matter of fact, every Gentile woman is
regarded as
N.Sh.G.Z. -
acronym for the Hebrew words
niddah, shifhah, goyah,
zonah
(unpurified from menses, slave, Gentil
e, prostitute). Upon conversion to
Judaism, she ceases indeed to be 
niddah, shifhah, goyah
but is still considered
zonah
(prostitute) for the rest of her life, simply by virtue of having been born of a Gentile
mother. In a special category is a woman &#39;conceived not in holiness but born in
holiness&#39;, that is born to a mother who had converted to Judaism while pregnant. In order to make quite sure that there are no mix-ups, the rabbis insist that a married
couple who convert to Judaism together must abstain from marital relations for three
months. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that was weird. </p>

<p>So who the hell is this &quot;Maimonides&quot; character, anyway? Sounds like a racist prick to me?</p>

<p>...Google...</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Theology/Thinkers_and_Thought/Jewish_Philosophy/Philosophies/Medieval/Maimonides.shtml">Maimonides (Rambam</a>)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The greatest medieval Jewish thinker, Talmudist and codifier.</p>

<p>By Rabbi Louis Jacobs</p>

<p>Spain to Cairo</p>

<p>Maimonides, known, after the initial letters of his name (Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon, “Rabbi Moses son of Maimon”) as Rambam, is generally acknowledged to be the greatest Jewish thinker, Talmudist, and codifier in the Middle Ages. </p>

<p>Maimonides was born in Cordoba [Spain] where his father was a dayyan, a judge. Maimonides was later proud to trace his descent from judge to judge back through many generations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, unlike Israel Shahak, this Maimonides guy appears to be very highly revered among Jews, doesn&#39;t he?</p>

<p>So the OP cites Shahak who cites Maimonides who is considered one of the greatest rabbis of all time, and you somehow think this discredits the OP?</p>

<p>Sorry, but I&#39;m not following your logic here, <strong>qmechan</strong></p>

<p>Is there something I&#39;m missing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>opinions about the non-Jews, the other part of organized US Jewry, the Reform, had never opposed them, and, in my view, show themselves to be quite influenced by them.
Actually the explanation of this apparent contradiction is
[103] easy. It should be recalled that Judaism, especially in its classical form, is totalitarian in nature. The behavior of supporters of other totalitarian ideologies of our times was not different from that of the organized American Jews. Stalin and his supporters never tired of condemning the discrimination against the American or the South African Blacks, especially in the midst of the worst crimes committed within the USSR. The South African apartheid regime was tireless in its denunciations of the violations of human rights committed either by communist or by other African regimes, and so were its supporters in other countries. Many similar examples can be given. The support of democracy or of human rights is there- fore meaningless or even harmful and deceitful when it does not begin with self-critique and with support of human rights when they are violated by one&#39;s own group. Any support of human rights in general by a Jew which does not include the support of human rights of non- Jews whose rights are being violated by the &#39;Jewish state&#39; is as deceitful as the support of human rights by a Stalinist. The apparent enthusiasm displayed by American rabbis or by the Jewish organizations in the USA during the 1950s and the 1960s in support of the Blacks in the South, was motivated only by considerations of Jewish self-interest, just as was the communist support for the same Blacks. Its purpose in both cases was to try to capture the Black community politically, in the Jewish case to an unthinking support of Israeli policies in the Middle East.
Therefore, the real test facing both Israeli and diaspora Jews is the test of their self-criticism which must include the critique of the Jewish past. The most important part of such a critique must be detailed and honest confrontation of the Jewish attitude to non-Jews. This is what many Jews justly demand from non-Jews: to confront their own past and so become aware of the discrimination and persecutions inflicted on the Jews. In the last 40 years the number of non-Jews killed by Jews is by far greater than the number of the Jews killed by non-Jews. The extent of the persecution and discrimination against non-Jews inflicted by the &#39;Jewish state&#39; with the support of organized diaspora Jews is also enormously greater than the suffering inflicted on Jews by regimes hostile to the~ Although the struggle against antisemitism (and of all other forms of racism) should never cease, the struggle against Jewish chauvinism and exclusivism, which must include a critique of classical Judaism, is now of equal or greater importance.</p>

<p>So, right away, we know we&#39;ve got the OP not referencing things properly.</p>

<p>That&#39;s okay, because I don&#39;t see where &quot;Talmud Encyclopedia&quot; is mentioned by anyone, so I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re just tossing up another red herring, right?</p>

<p>What we <em>do</em> know is that your objections here have been repeatedly shot down:</p>

<p>A) The Guardian article shows that the &quot;snuff porn&quot; incident was factual</p>

<p>B) Your attempt to discredit the article because it referenced Shahak was fruitless - because the quote was valid, Shahak cited Maimonides, and Maimonides is one of the most revered rabbis of all time.</p>

<p>C) That you are running around in circles and being deliberately obtuse in trying to discredit the material that the OP posted (saying that he cited the <strong>wrong page</strong> in Shahak&#39;s book, lol!)</p>

<p>What we <em>don&#39;t</em> know (yet - and this seems VERY important to <em>you</em>) is whether the snuff porn ring was run by Jews, as alleged - but then, I haven&#39;t bothered to look into the matter further (yet).</p>

<p>According to the Talmudic Encyclopedia: (42) &#39;He who has carnal knowledge of the wife of a Gentile is not liable to the death penalty, for it is written: &quot;thy fellow&#39;s wife&quot; (43) rather than the alien&#39;s wife; and even the precept that a man &quot;shall cleave unto his wife&quot; (44) which is addressed to the Gentiles does not apply to a Jew, just there is no matrimony for a heathen; and although a married Gentile woman is forbidden to the Gentiles, in any case a Jew is exempted.&#39;</p>

<p>So what? You&#39;re claiming that the work doesn&#39;t exist? It does, and has been in the works for <strong>72 years</strong> (too much arguing, would be my guess).</p>

<p>You&#39;re claiming that Shahak couldn&#39;t read it? He&#39;s quite fluent in Hebrew, and there&#39;s an English version.</p>

<p>You&#39;re claiming that Shahak lied? Dude, he knew damn well when he wrote the book that every asshat in the world would be nitpicking for ANY little error - like you are. Besides, the Talmud is full of so much insane shit that no one would have to make anything up.</p>

A lot of women worked at his factory and he made many of them have sex with him as the price of keeping their jobs. He was a typical piece of exploitative capitalist slime. But he hardly needed to rape and kill Mary Phagan when so many other women had no choice but to fuck him. It was more his exploitation of the women who worked for him that got him lynched than Phagan&#39;s murder. </p>
