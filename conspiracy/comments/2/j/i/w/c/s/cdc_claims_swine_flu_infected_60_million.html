<blockquote>
<p>In October of 2009, Sharyl Attkisson, writing for CBS News, <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/04/26/aftershocks-from-my-interview-with-sharyl-attkisson/">exposed the fact that the CDC had stopped counting Swine Flu cases in the US.</a> The real reason?</p>

<p>The overwhelming number of blood samples from the most likely Swine Flu patients, sent to labs, were coming back negative for the H1N1 (Swine Flu) virus, or any flu virus.</p>

<p>This was a killer. It left the CDC completely exposed. They were claiming there were tens of thousands Swine Flu cases in America. But the lab tests were revealing how preposterous that lie was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now there&#39;s a page on the CDC websitecalled “H1N1 Flu.” The article: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates_2009_h1n1.htm">CDC Estimates of 2009 H1N1 Influenza Cases, Hospitalizations and Deaths in the US.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a quote. Buckle up:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“During the pandemic, CDC provided estimates of the numbers of 2009 H1N1 cases, hospitalizations and deaths on seven different occasions. Final estimates were published in 2011. These final estimates were that from April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010 approximately 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (8868-18,306) occurred in the United States due to pH1N1.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SIXTY MILLION cases of Swine Flu in America. One out of every five people in the US had Swine Flu.</p>

<p>This lie takes the cake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Well, they caught us lying about tens of thousands of Swine Flu cases. All the tests came back negative. So what do we do?”</p>

<p>“Only one thing we can do. Tell a lie so huge it’ll paralyze the mind. People buy the biggest lies, right?”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now, the CDC is saying: there was a sudden acceleration of death in West Africa, beyond anything caused by <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/ebola-unproven-treatments-what-about-vitamins/">endemic grinding poverty, severe malnutrition, starvation, a decade-long war, lack of basic sanitation, industrial pollution, toxic vaccine campaigns.</a></p>

<p>Right now, the CDC is saying this outbreak is caused by <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/02/ebola-covert-op-in-a-hypnotized-world/">something called the Ebola virus.</a></p>

<p>Right now, <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/the-ebola-test-let-the-tests-inventor-speak/">the CDC is saying the tests used to diagnose Ebola are very accurate.</a></p>

<p>Feel free to believe the CDC.</p>

<p>Because you have faith. Because they must be right.</p>

Now, obviously, if don&#39;t believe anything the say, then this won&#39;t mean anything to you. But realize these are estimates based on data collected and then projected on larger scale.</p>

<p>In there abstract they write:<br/>
&quot;Through July 2009, a total of 43,677 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were reported in the United States, which is likely a substantial underestimate of the true number. Correcting for under-ascertainment using a multiplier model, we estimate that 1.8 million–5.7 million cases occurred, including 9,000–21,000 hospitalizations.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so 2-6 million...not 60 million....that seems right. During that time I saw my first case confirmed with swab and within 10 days we had thousands in the city and the lab stopped doing the tests because &gt;95% were coming back positive so we treated everyone with appropriate symptoms. It was extremely infectious and spread like wild fire...luckily it wasn&#39;t that deadly to healthy patients but at that time all of our ventilated beds (ICU where patients are intubated) in the whole city were occupied for over 60 days and we did have a number of deaths. The real cost was to schools, businesses, law enforcement and infrastructure with missed days as thousands and thousands of people were off work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not much news here, anyone who went to the hospital with the flu and were told they had the &quot;swine flu&quot; would know that they weren&#39;t tested because they weren&#39;t charged for it.  They just diagnosed based on &quot;symptoms&quot; and eventually decided to call all the flu cases that year H1N1.  I am willing to believe that there is some value to vaccination, but the whole flu shot thing is just a blatant scam.  Still, it&#39;s hard to believe that medical professionals could all be so dumb as to be fooled by it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some good research here. My only thought about it is more of a thought on how federal (state, ect) organizations operate. Too many people (usually dumbfucks on facebook, but whatever) think of it as some ultra arch villain or legion of doom in charge of &quot;The Government&quot; as if everything that occurs is preplanned and by design.</p>

<p>Its good never to trust any part of a government department, but while there most certainly are villains and fiends involved behind the scenes, most, if not all of the shit going on is due to lazy bureaucrats out of touch with the office across the hall, much less the american people.</p>

<p>Department heads are there because of some high placed cronyism, like Michael Brown&#39;s running of FEMA during Katrina whose most relevant job experience was as president of the goddamn Arabian horse association.</p>

<p>Compartmentalization, corrupt cronyism, profiteering over conflicts of interest, oceans of bureaucratic horseshit, and check-seeking, office politicians will doom a society as fast as anything else save nuclear war.</p>

<p>Im not saying that there are no evil intentions here, ESPECIALLY within the departments of education,  justice, and health &amp; human services. Jail industry, health industry, ect, has all been corrupted into moneymaking ponzi schemes designed to make specific corporate entities richer at the cost of the money and health of the taxpayers-and nothing else. I think the military industrial complex was probably the model they used.</p>
