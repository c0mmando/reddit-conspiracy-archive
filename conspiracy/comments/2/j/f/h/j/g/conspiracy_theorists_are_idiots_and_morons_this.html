       We continue to "spread freedom" by covertly overthrowing democratically elected governments with the CIA who also happens to be the biggest drug dealer in the states, which begs the question of WHY! Are we SWATing drug dealers who don't have a fancy CIA badge while we protect drug dealers who do have a fancy badge.  Also a big bank can make 800,000,000.00 dollars laundering drug money and if they get caught they have to pay a 4 million dollar fine.  So money launderers pay a lower tax rate than I do when I buy eggs at the grocery store.

       I've pretty much given up trying to convince people of all this. We are living in truly apathetic times. I actually can't wait for shit to go sideways so that people might actually wake the fuck up. Although I genuinely don't know what it will take for that to happen.

       There's a popular quote out there that I think applies to this kind of situation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “How did you go bankrupt?”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Two ways,”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Gradually and then suddenly.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       It'll hit the fan for us, not them. If the market crashes, they can consolidate. If people protest, they have even more reasons to "justify" the use of drones and other military techniques or martial law on us.

       But where's the reward in that? You risk outright rebellion, which means lost profits, lost workers and loss of faith in the ruling powers. There is literally no benefit to letting the economy collapse for any ruling power, that's goddamn suicide.

       I'm sorry, but in 1929 communist movements were growing worldwide, Hitler had nationalized all of Germany, Japan was moving against European imperialist interests and old regimes around the world were falling apart at the seams. I'd hardly consider that "gaining substantially".

       You have some homework to do my friend. Market crashes suck all the wealth from small time investors, retirement funds and so on and give it all to the big banks. Small and medium sized banks falter once a bubble bursts and get bought up by the big banks.

       Ah yes, Hitler, who denied internationalism and the global Judaism, who nationalized industries and enslaved political opponents, who wanted to expand Germany into a massive self-serving empire....was working for the illuminati? You really think that Hitler, the greatest isolationist and nationalist of all time, was working for globalization? Or are you saying that the Illuminati didn't

        mind

       the rise of Hitler, even though he came very, very close to dominating Europe and expelling the international banking influence.

       I think it's incredibly odd that according to this subreddit, all wars break out because of....banks? I mean, it ignores so much history, so many factors, my god, it's just such a simplistic worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you figure the illuminati let Iran nationalize, or North Korea? Wouldn't that just be more work for them in the future? Furthermore, how do you figure TBTB orchestrated a market crash, with billions of independent investors and consumers uncontrollable?

       Edit: I don't actually think all conspiracy theories are piffle, just a lot/most and get pissed off by lots of the people who do believe in them but asert their beliefs in the same way as the Daily Mail/Fox (who they complain about) - i.e. in a blinkered way chasing their own agenda regardless of facts and good science

       Well, assuming the TBTB are manufacturing crises like you say, would they not have to be very, very efficient at what they do? After all, manipulating global markets towards your favor is a very, very difficult goal. If these powers somehow have puppeted the entire Western world, I'd hardly consider them amateurs. :P

      <p>
       Although, I won't say there isn't manufacturing of crises. In fact, I think it's very likely. I don't deny corruption, I just deny this subs scale of it. I truly do not believe that the world is in any way organized.

       I think that at a certain point, the complexity of what the governments are doing may be too difficult for the average person to understand. Their reaction, in return, is to oversimplify the situation. In other words, if the complexity of a situation is too much, people who are unable to process it take the most simple route to forming an opinion rather than the more difficult, yet correct, route.

       This is the problem with American democracy. We are tied to the irrational voter... the tyranny of the average man, if you will.

       I've been feeling this. It seems as if the complexity of the world politics situations is too much for most people, even those who are supposed to be knowledgable about it. Even journalists don't want to spend all their waking hours trying to figure out one thing from another, and with the wildly divergent accounts of what is happening coming from every nation involved, with different levels of truth and propaganda, it seems most have given up and decided to just accept the official story since to go against it is so confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, it's not just world politics. Technology, science, social sciences, everything, there's just so much to know that nobody feels like they're on top of anything, and that's why nobody seems to have the confidence to really comment or analyze anything, especially not holistically.

       I feel like the depopulation stuff is more fearmongering on their part. If population control had been an agenda, surely it would have been more of a focus in the period up till now. Surely it's not a case of procrastination and they let the population explode to its current level and are only now getting round to culling it.

        advocating
       </em>
       the use of "
       <em>
        the big lie
       </em>
       ", but accusing
       <em>
        others
       </em>
       of doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Continuing the Hitler quote from where you left off:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. These people know only too well how to use falsehood for the basest purposes. From time immemorial, however, the Jews have known better than any others how falsehood and calumny can be exploited. Is not their very existence founded on one great lie, namely, that they are a religious community, where as in reality they are a race? And what a race! One of the greatest thinkers that mankind has produced has branded the Jews for all time with a statement which is profoundly and exactly true. Schopenhauer called the Jew "The Great Master of Lies". Those who do not realize the truth of that statement, or do not wish to believe it, will never be able to lend a hand in helping Truth to prevail.
       </p>

       There are many more examples of the misuse of Adolf's quotes.  For example when talking about genocide he said:
       <em>
        "Who still talks nowadays of the extermination of the Armenians?"
       </em>
       People often say that he was referring to the extermination of the Jews, he wasn't.  He was referring to the extermination of the Poles.

Even if he is not advocating the use of the lie, but accusing others of doing so, it just rings true of many methods of manipulation that have been or are being used against the people.

       Hmm, I thought the lie was that they were a race,

       just a religious community. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question mark.

       That is the way the quote is almost always portrayed, but in context, he was warning the readers to beware of those who use "The Big Lie".

       I feel we're somewhere around stage 3 now. Not fighting in a literal sense but they are taking active measures to discredit us and flood the populace with disinfo.

       Much like "SweatyBollocks" below, I've given up trying to convince people. Now when something comes up in conversation I say what needs to be said and remind them that in a few years time they will look back and realize we were right.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If by "normal people" you mean the general populace then you are incorrect. The general populace believes what they are told in the MSM and do not question the 'official' story.  After all, the media and our government wouldn't lie to us just like they would never spy on us.

       Even when you have THOUSANDS of architects and engineers, experts in their given fields, stating the twin towers could
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       have fallen at free-fall speeds given the damages they sustained without either:
a) Removing all (most) resistance between the top of the tower and the ground
or 
b) Re-writing the laws of physics
and they STILL believe the towers collapsed due to the planes hitting them and the resulting fire.

       Manning, Snowden and Segarra all broke the rules of their jobs. They may have done it for all the right reasons and end up being viewed as heroes. But they did break the rules and punishing them for it is not out of the ordinary. I don't think that most people will be outraged at the idea that someone who does something illegal or publicly questions their bosses will get fired.

       If some entity is trying to knock off nations without central banks,  Andorra, Monaco, Kiribati, Tuvalu or Palau should be in the news soon. People would probably be outraged if all of those nations were somehow systematically influenced by an organized groups in the near future, but that probably won't happen.

       Conspiracy theorists aren't idiots or morons, they just aren't good at presenting their ideas in a compelling and easily to understand manner. If respect is the goal, find examples of corruption that will really upset the average person. Things that have reasonable explanations or examples that don't resonate with most people won't have the intended effect. Don't worry about what people think of you and focus on putting a good story together.

       The Vostok data shows cyclical Co2 elevation that reaches way further back into history than human kind does.  And the temperature data extrapolated doesn't correlate in the way we are lead to believe.  There are clear changes in temp without any change in Co2 and where there is a correlation its often the temp that leads the Co2.  This is part of a natural process that has been happening far longer than climate science has been trying to explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is valid science in regards to ecosystem change which is man made, but not global climate.  Science requires that you be able to test a theory in a controlled environment, reproduce the results and once refined predict future results based on what you've learned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Climate science is dealing our whole planet so there is not a 2nd earth with which to have a control group, and when the predicted results fail to match reality then we have climate scientist scrambling to explain away the failure (the oceans absorbed the heat we predicted).  The climate science isn't falsifiable because there is no way to know if man made green house gases are to blame for climate change or natural processes.  We KNOW that man will continue to pollute, so pollution will increase. We have no control group earth2 that we can compare earth against.  We have no way to know if the climate would change without our added pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except for the fact we KNOW the climate has experienced cyclical changes for millions of years, now suddenly we are attributing these changes to our pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no fan of pollution, I can't imagine who would be, but we may as well attribute these changes in our climate to angry gods like our ancestors did.  There is no way to prove otherwise.

       Right and the big bang is just a fancy replacement for "let there be light".
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason that they deal with the universe mere seconds after it was formed is because the mathematics their theory is based on breaks down completely as we get mere seconds away from the 1 moment that counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let there be light, let there be a big boom, let there be.  Its all the same.

       We surely can keep making better models with which to explain our changing climate, but there have been obviously erroneous models that have predicted things accurately before and were still wrong.

       We do know how electrons interact and this only leads to more questions. When a person observes an electron it acts like a particle, yet when unobserved it acts like a wave of light. As far as climate change goes. The climate is and has always been changing it is one thing you can bank on it will change. As far as what humans are doing to screw up the atmosphere is nothing to what nature is going to do. Yellowstone is overdue for eruption and Is more active now then ever observed. When that goes the united states grain belt will be ruined causing massive famine and the climate will change drastically. Maybe a volcano tax is the answer?

       If you advocate the Big Bang that means you advocate the concept of Redshift via Doppler or Redshift via Universe Expansion. This pipe-dream of Astro-photography and Astro-theology is absolute garbage to anyone properly trained in plasma physics, spectroscopy, or quantum mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The redshift &amp; blueshift phenomenon have nothing to do with expansion or relative motion of heavenly bodies. Redshift is a photonic quantum phenomenon. Astrophysicists are not experts in photonics or quantum mechanics and their hairbrain idea on the topic of Big Bang is nothing more than Creationism. Redshift &amp; Blueshift are both owing to the variability of the Di-electric "constant" in high energy sparse plasma as found in space. This has been proven countless times by world reknown quantum physicists going back to Bohr &amp; Fermi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big Bang Creationists live in a pure fantasy land. End of discussion.

       Well in 10 years, the "elite" will have won at the pace it is going now. They only have a few country to invade, bomb and regime change to finish a "NWO" there isnt much country left that arent controlled by the 'same central banking cartel' When that happen, they will push to merge all the government to one entity and it will be over. But before this there will be war, because some country woke up to this strategy and are rallying, China, Russia, Syria, Iran and few others. But their military might is so thin they dont stand a chance vs the all mighty 'NWO military might' They only stand a chance economicly, that is why everyone is turning away from the petro dollar. Every last 100 years wars have been closely related and tie to the petro dollar survival, doesn't need a PhD to understand and see the facts. If you don't know all of the above, im sorry to teach you the facts and if you dont believe them your just a headless chicken running around on the roulette.

       I really don't feel like giving you a college education over reddit. Essentially though climate doesn't work that way, you can't just say "it's going to get hotter". Climate at its core is a trend and there are going to be variations in the "weather". See there is a distinction climate is the whole picture while weather is on the smaller more individual level. You have the two confused. Just because it is really cold one year doesn't mean the climate has changed that is simply a weather event. Whatever little "AH HA! Gotcha!" you have have already been thought about by scientist, which are certainly aware and take into account the sun and its cycles. We can see an accelerated trend in the data we have collected that is certainly unusual. We compare this to data taken from ice cores which archive previous atmospheres thousands of years ago on Earth. There are multiple methods scientists use to make sure all the data is consistent. This all points to the conclusion that the huge and constant release of greenhouse gases has an effect on global temperatures. Many greenhouse gases have a heating AND a cooling effect both of which can be equally bad. There are many natural buffering systems in place on Earth that help to keep climates relatively stable however once these are stressed enough, bigger changes can happen rapidly. There are a lot of things to understand and take account of, it's a very interesting and complex field.

       The issue is not the accuracy of global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that almost everyone arguing for and against global warming don't have a sufficient scientific background to have an opinion on the subject and their position on the issue is based solely upon politics and not science.

First of all none of you, as far as I know, are conspiring anything. People who question beliefs are called skeptics, why let such a loaded term as "conspiracy theorists" be a noose around your neck?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sceptic is a noun. A sceptic is someone who has doubts about things that other people believe.
Sceptical is an adjective. If you are sceptical about something, you have doubts about it.

       My point exactly. The CIA came up with the term "conspiracy theorist" to discredit people questioning the official narrative. Why are people who are, by the very definition of the word, skeptical of the official narrative, so eager to be labeled by a term that the very people who are concocting conspiracies coined in order to discredit any opposing point of view? I mean I know what a conspiracy is, this sub is called "conspiracy", but why are people here so ready to label themselves as conspiracy theorists, it doesn't do us any good. Being skeptical just means having doubts about other people's beliefs, especially those taken for granted.

       Well, assuming we want to get a point across, most people scoff when they even hear things like "a conspiracy", or "conspiracy theory". It is said the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.

       I also think skeptic is a good word to use. Skeptic has connotations of credibility in mainstream society, so you're pretty much turning it on its head in our context, which is pretty effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like Hunter S. Thompson in his campaign for sheriff. His credibility was being questioned because he was seen as a beatnik/hippy (in addition to having some pretty wacky policies), so he shaved his head and started referring to the incumbent sheriff as his "long-haired opponent". We need thinking like this.

       as for GIGO, that is why people upvoted the comment, because they know if you put "garbage in" you will get "garbage out", so asking me if CO2 levels have changed is a matter of how much confidence you have in the data.

       there are key players in academia who collaborate with each other to stifle any opposition, and this is about the definition of the term conspiracy... so take the modelling elsewhere, because climate science if chock full of factual conspiracy without even getting into modelling and data..

       I'm a numerical modeler, so I'm going to focus on numerical modelling, because that is what I know. The notion that there is some conspiracy in academia that is working to suppress publication of contradictory work that stands up to peer review is laughable; any scientist in any field would kill for such a paper that would turn the current orthodoxy on its head; they'd never have to worry about finding funding ever again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why that hasn't happened is because an such paper would fall apart under scrutiny.

       Normal people know all these things. The difference between typical conspiracy theorists and normal people is that conspiracy theorists
       <em>
        want to believe
       </em>
       something is real when there is no credible evidence or their belief can be rationally explained by something much simpler.

       Normal people know all these things now.  Before there was credible evidence of these things they called us idiots and morons.

       Your in denial, you're trying to explain away how the idiots and morons managed to be right about things.

       Its like gravity, we don't understand how it works or the specific physics involved in it working.  But we can see its effect on our world.  We can feel its force pushing us down.  Just like we could feel the corruption of the FED before we had any credible evidence of its corruption.  We could feel the over reach of big brother before we had credible evidence of 5 eyes or NSA domestic spying.

       I was the idiot and the moron when I spoke out against military action in Libya, now my ideas look pretty good.

       so explain why there are professional paid (not necessary performance) shills and trolls in almost every forum decrying any mention of CT.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the ideas and theories and observations are so so very wrong, why are there salaried shills doing duty rubbishing every theory and idea. by their presence they admit theres fire before the smoke.
      </p>
      <p>
       you could understand a few people just doing shilling and trolling for a hobby, but the sheer number of very well written and long hour duty shills points to organized social engineering.

       the oddity is the number who tell lies about capital crimes, go along with the lies over 9/11 or Sandy Hook, they open themselves up to legal action down the road. 'accessory after the fact' etc. covering up mass murder etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       these people that do this have to be dumb, anybody with a brain would not put themselves into such a legal predicament. not to mention 'other' revenge activities sometime down the road from the 3000 9/11 families that had people murdered by the criminals on 9/11.

       That's just it man.  You aren't going to have evidence about a super secret agency that is above the law and protected from transparency (even from the president himself).

       The things he mentioned in his comment just then are all things that are regularly on the Daily Show and such. Hell, I read an article today on theage.com.au that directly cited wikileaks. I don't know why people think this is something that isn't in the mainstream line of thought, the whole surveillance state and government control. That is a very common conversation amongst people outside of conspiracy theorists as well.

       There are always possibilities that events such at 9/11 are not what they seem. But most of the bullshit conspiracy theorists spouted was so wrong that entire books were written with solid evidence just to disprove them.

       so, you believe that 19 muslims successfully hit the pentagon with a Boeing 757 on 9/11, but you don't know
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       you believe that? you can't point to one bit of evidence that supports your crazy conspiracy theory? did you get your info from tabloid type sources like #CNN, #FoxNews, #CNBC, #NYTimes #BostonGlobe #HLN #CNNbrk?

       FEMA and NIST have no credibility left regarding anything to do with 9/11.

       FEMA says fuel brought down WTC7, NIST says burning paper destroyed the building.

       both cannot be correct.

       the NYPD took a 35mm photo on 9/11 of a non United Airlines plane flying into or near the WTC2, looks more like a 737 with smaller engines and the strange pyramid logo or lettering near the front looks very much like a fuzzy ATA, as in 'American Trans Air'

       I don't believe it was a conspiracy. The have been some details which make me question what they say, but I also know that there is still not enough evidence to support the full theory. Out of any large event like this there will always be questionable details
       <em>
        IF
       </em>
       you go searching for them. It is a very predictable and well documented trait in humans that they often see what they want to see and any small detail that supports their belief will only make them feel like they're right, often in denial of overwhelming evidence against it. I believe there was no direct government involvement. I believe Islamists with extreme views wanted to suicide bomb the US in the same way they bombed England on 7/5 and the way they continue to bomb just about everyone that is not their branch of Islam.

       The question is: what is the definition of a normal person?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it really matter today since "normal people" think inside the box and won't believe anything outside the box unless a higher authority tells them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it has to do with "wanting to believe". Its like Area 51. Before that event UFO reporting was not wide spread but the person that saw it knew what he saw and described it the best he could. The mistake he made was calling the authorities which in turn changed the story and everyone believed it.

       The idea of a conspiracy theorist is to look into things that people don't believe or don't want to believe because there is no scientific evidence backing it up. I think it's foolish to blindly believe the scientific community because we also know they have been wrong in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes some people are gullible that is proven. Even normal people do not know how to do the proper research required to discover the truth. The whole idea of this website is for people to come here in learn and see what other people are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think today as individuals have to do more then we thought because we've learned the normal sources of information are proven not to be accurate.

       Science looks into ALL possibilities. If there is no evidence to suggest something, then it is not possible to identify it as a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your problem seems to be that you're ignorant of what you're describing as the scientific community. The scientific method is never wrong. The scientific method allows us to make conclusions using the evidence we have and
       <em>
        nothing more
       </em>
       . If new evidence comes to light, then it will come to a new conclusion. The difference between the scientific method and believing in something is that when you hold a belief you make the choice to ignore the most probable and well supported conclusion and you choose to call your belief fact while being ignorant to evidence that supports other possibilities.

       I think that at a certain point, the complexity of what the governments are doing may be too difficult for the average person to understand. Their reaction, in return, is to oversimplify the situation. In other words, if the complexity of a situation is too much, people who are unable to process it take the most simple route to forming an opinion rather than the more difficult, yet correct, route.

       This is the problem with American democracy. We are tied to the irrational voter... the tyranny of the average man, if you will.

      <p>
       If we understand that you can not teach a monkey calculus, why are we forced to be subjected to the whim of the average person with the expectation that they should understand global politics?

       If a "natural disaster" is responsible for wiping out hundreds of thousands of people, destroying crops, sending the U.S. into chaos and martial law- how could we possibly pin it on any people?

       there are key players in academia who collaborate with each other to stifle any opposition, and this is about the definition of the term conspiracy... so take the modelling elsewhere, because climate science if chock full of factual conspiracy without even getting into modelling and data..

       You mean making climate models that fail to predict reality?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes yes, I should avoid commenting until I have been baptised into the world of academic masterbation that produces climate models which fail to predict anything accurately.  Then when faced with failure I'll explain it all away by claiming the oceans absorbed my data.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is no different than those dooms day cults which are forced to constantly redo the math every time their dooms day prediction fails to happen.
