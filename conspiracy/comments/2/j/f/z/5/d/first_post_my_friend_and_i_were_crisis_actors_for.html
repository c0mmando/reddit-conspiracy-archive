      <p>
       So, I got a call from a friend who told me about a Craigslist ad. It offered $350 cash to do "crisis" acting. This was in and around the Pulaski County, AR area. I called the number and met a recruiter type of guy at a hotel lobby and he signed me up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first day, we met at a fire station close to the 65th Street area in Southwest Little Rock. There were probably about 30 people that responded to the ad and came out to "act." After the army unit showed up and set their tents up, we all had to go through an old pile of clothes to get in costume. After getting dressed, we went through a moulage process where they put fake injuries on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each person was assigned a color: green, yellow, or red to signify your severity of injury. This determined your priority level in regard to who got "aid" first. Each soldier (they said they were with a reserve unit) wore full white suits that I believe someone referred to as MOPP gear.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple of soldiers would lead you through a "shower" area where you had to sponge yourself with water and Dawn dishwashing liquid (to signify a chemical decontamination I guess). Then they gave you a paper suit with shoes and all to wear. Once that was done, you toss the suit, rinse, and repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       We did this three different days with each day being "processed" a little faster than the previous day. The last day the company that put on the event graded the unit on their proficiency. It was all pretty damn fun because you were expected to act like a belligerent citizen who'd been through a crisis. Usually, a person would walk up and tell you what your ailment was so that the troops could get experience dealing with different injuries, illnesses, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were told that the decontamination area was a mock up of the entry to a larger camp that would house displaced civilians. Like I said, it was kind of fun and they cut us a check on the last day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward a year later and this Ebola thing is happening (with Patient 0 having arrived five hours away from here in Dallas no less). It's made me wonder if that was a typical thing for the army to do or what? I've never served but I always had friends in the National Guard who would respond to disaster areas (mainly tornado aftermath) here in state. Any of you guys ever done anything like this or served and went through any of this type of training? The suits the soldiers wore looked similar to the ones the people were wearing when they loaded that infected nurse on the plane. Just curious! Thanks for reading.

       Yeah this is just regular exercise stuff that happens a lot I never heard of civilians getting used for it though.. But it sounds like a typical simulation with some type of chemical attack ( that's what the MOPP gear is for) with a mass casualty incident ( that's where your triage comes in) and the showers and all that is your transition from the 'hot' zone of the attack to the 'cold' zone so you want contaminate anyone in there.. It's typical exercise stuff just a coincidence on timing with the Ebola spread... And my writing and grammar and shit is terrible cut me some slack lol

       I would think this would be more applicable for a chemical destruction accident at the armory, or an explosion at the papermill in Pine Bluff. Both of those things are real possibilities and require training and planning to save lives.

       Good points. I'm not sure if they finished getting rid of all the chemical weapons in the Pine Bluff arsenal or not. I agree with the one poster though. It was just a routine training exercise that happened to be about a year before this Ebola thing. We didn't sign nondisclosure agreements and everything was sort of lax and fun. If anything, the fact that the soldiers were personable makes me trust them more than the LRPD if something ever happened.
