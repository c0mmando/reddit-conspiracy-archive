<p>&quot;The Federal Executive Boards in New York City and Northern New Jersey in partnership with FEMA Region II, The Department of Health and Human Services Region II, NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) and the <strong>Clearing House Association</strong> are sponsoring a two year series of pandemic influenza continuity exercises - tabletop exercise 2013 (complete), full scale exercise 2014 -  to increase readiness for a pandemic event amongst Federal Executive Departments and Agencies, US Court, State, tribal, local jurisdictional and private sector continuity.&quot;</p>

<p>What is <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_House_Association">The Clearing House Association</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Clearing House Association, LLC is the United States&#39; oldest banking association representing 17 of the world&#39;s largest commercial banks, which collectively employ over 2 million people and hold more than half of all U.S. deposits. It is a nonpartisan advocacy organization representing—through regulatory comment letters, amicus briefs and white papers—the interests of its owner banks on a variety of systemically important banking issues.</p>

<p>Members of The Clearing House include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. The Clearing House Payments Company, an organization owned by the same banks, was established in New York in 1853 for the purpose of processing transactions among banks. It has offices in New York, North Carolina and Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>2014: Stage 3: Pandemic Influenza Exercise 2014 to include Full-scale and Tabletop exercise components</p>

<p>September 23, 2014 - 10:00-11:30am: Pandemic Webinar I: Federal and Local Government Pandemic Planning</p>

<p>The PowerPoint presentations for the speakers can be downloaded at the webinar link in the lower right hand corner of the screen.</p>

<p>Speakers and Topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ira Tannenbaum, New York City Office Of Emergency Management (NYCOEM) - How would NYCOEM keep essential services going during an infectious disease outbreak?</p></li>
<li><p>Gerry McCarthy, Port Authority Of New York and New Jersey - How would New York transportation (i.e. airports, bridges, etc.) be impacted during a disease outbreak?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jerry Hauer, New York Department of Homeland Security - How would state services be impacted in the event of a pandemic?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>J. Silva/Howard Zucker, NYS Department of Health - What services would be prioritized in the event of disease outbreak? </p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Never forget Jerry Hauer&#39;s connections with 9/11. He was on television that day while working as a National Security Advisor for the Department of Health and Human services ready with the talking points practically before the dust settled. This name should mean something to you. He was the former head of the NYC mayor&#39;s Office of Emergency Management services. </p>

<p>Notice the talking points he hits that have become the official story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the correct answer. Think of it as a difference in tactics. What was George W. Bush&#39;s administration all about? Shock and Awe. (and don&#39;t get me started in the whole GWB was an idiot and didn&#39;t run things - I&#39;m just using his administration as an adjective to describe who was running things then).</p>

<p>What&#39;s Obama all about? He&#39;s not a Shock and Awe guy. He arms rebels, his stuff is covert, and they&#39;re using a long, drawn out psyop as their weapon of choice. And the fear on this one will be spectacular.</p>

<p>I guess all we&#39;re missing is a link to ISIS, and I have seen dubious reports of ISIS members willing to martyr themselves via Ebola. We already have been pre-programmed for a chemical/biological attack from that whole Terror Laptop Of Doom® 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note their solution to 9/11 was the Patriot Act, the creation of DHS, and then a military buildup with a strategic incentive for older military equipment to be acquired at virtually no cost to local police departments (because the military was buying new ones *<em>because terrorism</em>).</p>

<p>Now, they have that stuff in place. Their goals this time will be to squash the free speech of the internet by embedding clauses for ISPs to have the ability to <em>restrict lawful content</em>, of which will be conveniently determined by the government. All alternative forms of communication can be shut down, because after all, ISIS has a social media presence and used the Internet to recruit!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/isis-uses-social-media-to-recruit-western-allies/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/isis-uses-social-media-to-recruit-western-allies/</a></p>

<p>Once the ISIS threat is contained (and it will be), they will then be able to foster their new fancy cyber security agency (it will be this Event&#39;s DHS in a restructuring of the FBI/NSA/CIA cyber departments), which I think will be their solution of choice here. They will then focus this agency inward to focus on the number one domestic threat: sovereigns. </p>

<p>Remember - they had the Patriot Act written years in advance of their social, media, and military campaigns to come together: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/12/ron-paul-%E2%80%9Cthe-patriot-act-was-written-many-many-years-before-911-and-the-attacks-simply-provided-opportunity-for-some-people-to-do-what-they-wanted-to-do%E2%80%9D.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/12/ron-paul-%E2%80%9Cthe-patriot-act-was-written-many-many-years-before-911-and-the-attacks-simply-provided-opportunity-for-some-people-to-do-what-they-wanted-to-do%E2%80%9D.html</a></p>

<p>The challenge to us now is to find out what they already have ready waiting in the wings. To me, it&#39;s the Net Neutrality legislation, but that doens&#39;t help with Ebola stuff so there has to be more.</p>

<p>Part of it could be Executive Order 13295</p>

<p>It used to read:</p>

<p>(b) <strong>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)</strong>, which is a disease associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness, is transmitted from person to person predominantly by the aerosolized or droplet route, and, if spread in the population, would have severe public health consequences. </p>

<p>Now it reads:</p>

<p>&quot;(b)  <strong>Severe acute respiratory syndromes</strong>, which are diseases that are associated with <strong>fever</strong> and signs and symptoms of pneumonia <strong>or other respiratory illness, are capable of being transmitted from person to person, and that either are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic</strong>, or, upon infection, are highly likely to cause mortality or serious morbidity if not properly controlled.  <strong>This subsection does not apply to influenza</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Why is the influenza claim in there? It sticks out sorely. The Official Reasoning of the order is that SARS is no longer applicable, as there hasn&#39;t been a case in years and the regulations were updated and broadened.  Think about it - if there was initial hesitation back when SARS was out there that &quot;The Government is going to come get us and take us to FEMA camps!&quot; they were re-assured that it would only be for SARS. And now it&#39;s not, 10 years later. What else is getting the legislative creep treatment?</p>

<p>Also, continuity of government plans have been in place for decades.  Ever looked into Mount Weather?  That&#39;s where this is eventually headed - all that&#39;s needed is an excuse to call a &quot;state of emergency&quot;.</p>
