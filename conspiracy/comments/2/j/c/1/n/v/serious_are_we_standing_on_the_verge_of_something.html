       Hi guys, I'm a relatively new member and a rare contributor but have been following the news in this sub for roughly six months (and the topics discussed have been mostly new to me) so I wanted to pose a question to those of you who have been around here much longer.  From what I can tell, with the way things seem to be going, it would appear that the world is on the brink of some form of catastrophic collapse, or revolution, or deadly outbreak, or full blown martial law, etc etc that could take place as early as within the next 5 years.  Now my question is this:  Do you believe that that sort of something is plausible and imminent or does the nature of the news discussed in this sub perpetually lead one to believe that we are always standing on the verge of something big happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that my question makes sense. Thanks.

       The Big One will never happen. Or, at least, you won't notice if it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Big One alerts people to the undercurrent of fuckery. Therefore, the death of a republic must come in a storm of a thousand paper cuts. Which we are enduring now.

       It's a barely perceptible slide to the bottom. That's the big secret. If you can get the 'aware' to be constantly tilting at windmills (sites like reddit are a huge help in this regard) then they will be just as much (if not more so) subjects of fear as the average joe. And each one, teaches one.

       You'll know long before that happens. The moment the right people are convinced (note: it's already a mathematical certainty, but powerful people benefit still from pretending there's debate) there will be an economic collapse, they will stomp on the tails of editors nationwide, and from the Most Awesome Goddamn Propaganda Apparatus Ever Created will issue forth a roar that has been fortold. And that roar will sound like this:

       Pretty much.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick is to get everyone to think about conventional warfare as the qualifier for world war. Hence all the films, movies, games, ect. about WWII. That was the ideal war by the elite's measure: lots of casualties on the poor side, profits abound for the rich, and the pre-requisite shuffling of the deck chairs (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">
        personnel
       </a>
       ) that makes sure no significant amount of research or progress was lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Progress towards what, however, is another discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'd like to have that kind of World War again, but this asymmetrical warfare is all the rage with the kids. And Ebola works just fine where cannonballs did. More profitable too, since it's a one time investment, a patent, and then you just cash the checks as the suckers line up at the Walgreens for the 'antidote'.

       You're absolutely correct.  I've felt like the tension is shifting towards another event or series of events that sort of wipes the slate clean for new civilizations to emerge or assume prominence.  Such examples like Alexander the Great or Genghis Kahn or any number of events in history that cleared room for new powers and ideals to become dominant.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sorry for my need of clarification but I've never heard the phrase "tilting at windmills" before.  Do you considering being a subject of fear a good thing or a bad thing?  Since the next thing you said was "each one teaches one" it seems like a good thing but the phrasing makes it sound negative.

       I think it was a Don Quixote reference, where windmills represent empty threats but the fear is real, and wether we spread the bad news mindlessly like the %90 or with altruistic intent, the bad news still gets spread.

       Tilting at windmills is a reference to Don Quixote. The literary equivalent of a red herring. Tilting at windmills is bad if you're after some kind of truth.

       Im pretty new here too.  But i have heard most of these stories and theories from just researching myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the answer is only TPTB know.  Personally it seems like there are mountains of evidence stacking up for a number of things to be truly happening.  But there could be a number of reasons... all of this ebola could be a distraction from something else happening... vice versa for ISIS or global warming or (insert catastrophe here).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that since 911 the internet has hindered TPTB ability to keep everyone in the dark.  There are alot of people that are 'on to them' so it would be in there best interest to keep people looking into ebola so that they can do what they want with ISIS...
      </p>
      <p>
       Its pointless to worry too much about any of this.  I use all my research and reading to just educate myself and prepare mentally, and physically for what COULD happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       It never hurts to be prepared.  They want to catch everyone off guard and in a panic.  The more you know the better off you will be.

       whatever the catalyst....I think most people on a whole can just subconsciously feel some society altering events are approaching...I think that's what draws people to this site...we feel the world crashing and want the most information and the truth...nobody trusts TPTB or the media...im fairly new myself...and the enormity of the "conspiracies" on here is over whelming...can't put Pandora back in the box.

       I would sincerely hope that the average person can just feel "society altering events are approaching" but I live in Alabama where I'm sad to report that the breakdown of people is roughly this: 90% (and this is being generous) are unaware of virtually anything discussed on this sub and believe that the way things are are just the way things have always been and the way they are supposed to be (which makes me incredibly sad), about 8% of people are noticing the state of things and how corrupt everything is but have a helpless sense of the problem is "too big to solve" or believe (and probably rightly so) that there's nothing they can do to help change the status quo so they just fall back to the behavior of the 90%, and then there's the minuscule 2% or less that actually want to discuss these things and therefore hopefully spur some change.  I hope it's different in other places.

       The thing that pisses me off is that everywhere you look there is disinformation.  I cant really even read a news site (Cnn, Bbc, Daily Mail, anything) without thinking that 90% of this is bullshit.  I just dont feel like any source is 100% trustworthy... haha... maybe i have a disorder.

       In every revolution you have a massive 90% that doesn't know wtf, 5% is plenty to succeed, it needs to be on the same page though, that's the hard part (without infinite money i mean).

       You seem to be waiting for a revelation, the revolution has long started, you are not here by coincidence, the revolution brought you here, how many beliefs have you abandoned before coming down this merry hole? Now historically beliefs are replaced by new beliefs, and the process is controlled by whoever creates the beliefs, but this time it's different because of the internet, different in that we can check and crosscheck, and build upon the work of the "crowded online mind", different except for the dropping beliefs part, luckily that's still around! The walk ahead probably extends beyond our own lifespans though, history is more patient than we are :(
      </p>
      <p>
       This being said, while the general plan is available to us if anything through deduction, sometimes documentation, when and how their steps are taken is still only available long after the facts, so the prediction you are asking for is... kind of a lottery game where the rare winner gets to say "told ya" after facts. You would think the losers would stop playing but nope :D

       To expound on this, I think the best bet the world has for a revolution is pushing the means to access the humanity's collective of information through the internet. First make internet available everywhere, then make education free/available through it. Not only would we then have a population that couldn't be lied to by 'tptb' but then we'd also have more skilled people able to apply their skills and knowledge for the common good, 'tptb' could be rotated if everyone was capable of making mindful decisions considering the well being of all of humanity. Free global education would be the catalyst for revolution, just as the existence of the internet itself has become the awakening.

       Well, any "improvement" on our current "dystopia" would be a step towards a "utopia".. I just don't like the terms, they have implications. I just call it what it is, a change, an improvement, positive growth, some of which has already started as outlined by your question and your feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see ignorance as the biggest issue or contributing, and education as the first step to not only fixing ignorance, but the first step to fixing ANY issue. If you have a problem, you should learn as much as possible about it before acting. If someone honestly wanted to start a revolution, that would be the place to start, in our minds. The more people who "know better" the harder it will be for TPTB to convince them to do shitty things.

       One thing I've noticed about the conspiracy forums I tend to go to is that they DO give good insight on events of how the world does tend to run, etc.  However, things are often sensationalized and there is a lot of misinformation that seems to get pumped into these things to make it hard to tell what is true and what isn't.
Anytime anything 'big' seems to happen, you'll see the "It's happening!" thing pop up, and then nothing really BIG really happens or so it seems...so it goes into a running joke in a way.
All you can do is try to do your own research into each topic and try to figure out what feels right to you or not.

       Something big is coming I believe. We will witness the dismantling of the control and power of the few over the many. This is the grand conspiracy. We will see with our own eyes how deep this rabbit hole goes and how a small group of families have literally taken control of the planet. These family factions will turn on each other. This will be witnessed by the world.

       What I believe many of us think is that these people move at a very slow pace, and are quite used to taking their time. If you have read much of the information that is available about the freemasons / illuminatti / whoever are regarded to be the real PTB, is that the end goal is a totalitarian one world government, along with a singular world currency that is 100% electronic and 100% rigged against the general population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slowly but surely, the governments of the world have all been forced to take private central banks, all owned by the same people. The only nations left on this earth that have not accepted one of these banks are the ones that are demonized in our media as the "worst" dictatorships in the world. North Korea is probably the best example of this. Iran is another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once all nations have their currency issuance reigned in, then the next step will be to merge them into one. This has been a long process, but only a few countries are left on the checklist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example of how they work slowly is the way things are progressing here in the US. Immediately following 9/11, and with the passing of the Patriot Act, many of us who understood what this event really was about knew that one of the ultimate end goals would be to eventually turn the "War on Terror" against the US public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now over 13 years after the event, we do not see citizens being marched off to prisons or camps as terrorists, but things have certainly progressed in that direction quite a bit. There have been all sorts of new ways described by politicians and the media about how US Citizens can be called terrorists, and now we're hearing that our leader's biggest fears are citizens becoming "radicalized" by ISIS or whatever the new hot group of the month is, we have a clear precedent set for the labeling and persecution of citizens as terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are used to working slowly. Average people are more used to wanting to see things in short timeline, we are impatient and if something does not come to fruition in a year or two, it is often written off as unfounded paranoia. This is why I do not like when people predict dates for certain events transpiring. Unless you are in on the plot, you simply don't know these things and cannot have any idea what is really going to happen in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing we can do is look at our history and current state of affairs as the best indicator of where we are headed. IMO, there are big plans on the horizon, but we have not way of knowing exactly how far off in the future they will be.

       they said came true, then Bush would still be President after removing term limits, the economic collapse would have happened multiple times over, and we'd all be living in FEMA camps after getting forcibly vaccinated for bird flu.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in (sane) emergency preparedness and taking the government's word at face value. But I refuse to live in fear anymore. I refuse to have the "collapse is going to happen any day now!" dread hanging over my head anymore. Nobody in this community knows exactly when, where, and how it's going to happen, and anyone who claims otherwise is a liar. I'll keep an eye on things, but I am not going to waste anymore of my life feeling terrible over paranoid speculation and events beyond my control.

       <em>

       The information is out there, it's just up to the population to decide when enough is enough.  In my opinion, we are ripe for revolution.  But who will we fight?  Most police officers and military personnel like myself are just trying to do good and feed our families.  It's up to the people to decide who, when and how.

       I believe so without a doubt.  Every aspect of "the system" is pushed to the brink.  Environment, geopolitics, the financial system, class separation, big military, mistrust in government...  I believe TPTB would not push it so far unless they were close to their endgame.  However I think it is something much bigger than we imagine.  For example all of the planets in the solar system are experiencing big changes right now as described in this article.

       The nature of the news here would perpetually lead one to believe that we are on the brink of some global catastrophic event.

       This is why its important to understand that there are several distinct groups present here that have clear cut agendas.

       IMHO the stock market crash of 08 was a huge deal that has been covered up by the AstroTurf.  Even the acknowledged wrongs of that event are grossly understated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as far as some huge event that will change the globe as we know it, I think there are two things that have a chance to actually live up to the hype.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         World War 3, if it happens, would be far nastier than any of its predecessors and likely change the world as we know it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Its plausible that there is some cyclical event which causes a number of natural disasters to happen all at once (magnetic pole shift or something big that passes by our solar system every so often). This could be what triggers glacial periods to begin or extreme volcanic activity.  There is only so much natural disaster we can deal with before we get knocked back into the stone age.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The important thing to keep in mind is that only YOU can make your choices.  If you let others lead you than its important that you pick a good leader.  If you won't be lead by anyone than its important to be self sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is subjective,  it is never absolute, it usually lays somewhere in the middle of two extremes and it only has the potential to set you free.  Like everything else you may learn in this world, what you do with it matters more than just learning it.

       I'm not convinced that the groups you mentioned aren't interrelated or mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in regards to your 2 later points. Everyone being armed with nuclear weapons postpones a global war for the time being in my opinion.  Hence why the major powers fight proxy wars in the meantime.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I sort of agree with your second point and have noticed that natural disasters seem to be increasingly prevalent but I'm not sure if this is just true or an illusion caused by the vastly increased access to information and the speed with which it travels.  But about the pole shift, I don't know if that will ever happen because the magnetic pole strength has only ever been observed decreasing so we're not sure it's going to shift drastically (ie. reverse) or just continue to weaken.

       When Bill Clinton was President all the ultra-right wing militia types always talked about UN takeover, martial law, socialist dictatorship, and so on.  When GWB was president, the left talked about how it was fascist takeover, ultra-isolationist whackjob turned American-Empire-bound expansionist dictator.  Now that Obama is President it's more of the same, except this time I hear both, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're farther and farther away from any collapse.  Full-blown martial law is the same distance it has always been.  Nothing is imminent except that governments will continue to be inept, conspiracy forums will still assume they can work miracles, and the ultra rich will still get away with whatever they want while everyone is worried about impending doom.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seriously heard the exact same arguments almost daily ever since my first exposure to conspiracy theories and forums in 1992.  The perpetrators change in some weird cycle though:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "oh look, now it's reptilians aliens," "oh look, now it's 'the global elite'," "oh look, now it's back to the jews," "oh hey, it's the liberals again," "whoops! Now we're back to the UN"

       Just out of interest, how do you view the economy compared to the Clinton and GWB eras?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that we're genuinely on the brink of a major collapse. We've got:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        $1.5 quadrillion in derivatives;
       </li>
       <li>
        A near-zero percent interest rate (which, given the above mentioned derivatives market, will collapse the entire system if it's moved in just the slightest upward direction);
       </li>
       <li>
        8-10% of real inflation;
       </li>
       <li>
        More and more countries abandoning the dollar/petrodollar;
       </li>
       <li>
        BRICS;
       </li>
       <li>
        A major currency war (and a major currency debasement);
       </li>
       <li>
        Possibly the greatest wealth disparity in history.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I think I'm right in saying that fiat currency has a 100% failure rate, and this kind of environment is typically how empires end.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not even taking into account the geopolitical situation, i.e the US's determination to get WWIII, which I suspect is really a retaliation towards countries that no longer want anything to do with the dollar/petrodollar. Iraq announced in 2000 that they were pricing oil in euros, and Libya did the same but with dinars, which prompted the US to liberate both countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has this kind of thing always been the case? I'm not trolling - just genuinely interested in seeing how the current climate compares to recent history as I was drinking the Kool-Aid until about five or six years ago.

       That's just it.  Yes, this kind of thing has
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been the case.  Not with those particulars, but with a different set of particulars that experts, theorists, and conspiracy theorists all said were the worst it's ever been and it will ultimately lead to the major catastrophe.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's always an extremely precarious situation.  If any little thing moves just a little bit everything will all crash and we'll end up in [collapse | American Union | under UN-globalist control | Jesus coming back | apocalypse | Zombies | and so on].  Then something moves.  It makes the 24hr news for a day or two.  And everyone forgets.  It's happened countless times.

      <p>
       Each time, everything just went on.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for war?  Look around, man. We're probably already are in WWIII right now.  We have a shitload of skirmishes that tons of people are involved in all over the world, right?  So what?  That won't bring about the collapse.  If anything, it strengthens the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currency crashes?  Happens all the time.  Look at Zimbabwe.  Look at Iceland.  The people and the system just keep going though.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, man... this has always been the case.   Always.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as long as we're looking for the [ insert whatever here ], we'll always see that's it's just around the corner.

       I think it's because we are actually in the middle of a major shift in history/change in the world. as another post said on here, it's gradual cuts or slices that make this change.
      </p>
      <p>
       but with the rise of the BRIC nations, radical islam, and the reemergence of russia... the times we live in now are a changing to say the least.

       Something's always "just around the corner". That's what everyone from the mainstream media to independent blogs say so that you'll buy their stuff, watch their ads and be afraid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get an education and get outside, and it's amazing how little any of this fear actually matters.
