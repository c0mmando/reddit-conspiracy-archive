        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>I am a graduate student in Colorado. For one of my classes, I am writing a paper analyzing the factors behind the growth of the Sovereign Citizen movement, as well as the law enforcement policies regarding the movement. This paper is for my professor only, but it is a topic I am interested in.</p>

<p>I know what the FBI says about SCs, but I would really like some first-hand information and opinions from people associated with the movement or at least very familiar with it. My goal is not to judge or condemn, but rather have an honest discourse and see the other side of the story.</p>

<p>If you have any information, theories, or links you&#39;d like to share, I&#39;d really appreciate it. I am happy to answer any questions about my purposes here as well. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center link is semi-accurate, but is terribly racist and doesn&#39;t apply to most sovereigns that I&#39;ve come across (I&#39;m not a card carrying member but have done a solid amount of research and am leaning towards them having at least <em>an argument</em> with some factual basis).</p>

<p>I think your best bet is to capture why the movement (I hesitate to call it that, but you used it to it stays) is at least slightly attractive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that is what I am going for (and what word would be better to use?).  I became interested in this topic when I saw START&#39;s report this year that law enforcement now ranks SC above domestic terrorism in terms of threat.  This kind of boggled my mind, but it got me thinking about the growth of SC and why it&#39;s beginning to appeal to more people.  I do suspect that the militarization of the police may be a factor.</p>

<p>I am also unsure of the length of my paper (it&#39;s pretty open-ended), and I am definitely still in the research stage.  A lot of my research has gotten me bogged down in lawsuits and litigation (and forums that tend to dismiss and laugh at SC), which hasn&#39;t been helpful.  I am eventually going to get into the academic articles and law enforcement side, but I want to first understand SC and have a good grasp of the ideology.  I have a general idea of their belief in the illegitimacy of the government, but not much background on where that belief comes from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My general idea is that by some mechanism, the US government has become illegitimate, which means that their laws are inapplicable and people working for the government are not public servants, but private employees or contractors with no legal standing. Citizens therefore do not owe taxes and are not subject to laws. I read some about contracts, if that makes any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know, now, that the US government was quietly overthrown in a coup that began with JFK&#39;s assassination, and a policy coup that resulted from 9/11, an attack on its own people. The federal government is clearly illegitimate, and is using tax dollars to fund illegal wars on sovereign nations, killing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of innocent civilians.</p>

<p>It is therefore both illogical to recognize the US government&#39;s laws and immoral to pay taxes. The US has no government. We are all sovereign, without a proper government, held captive by a criminal organization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks a lot for this, I find it really interesting.  Can you direct me to some of the websites you read?  Anything else I should read to get more information on this?</p>

<p>Do you think that more people are starting to share this view?  And where do you see it going?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Western corporate news (CNN, MSNBC, BBC, Fox, etc.) is propaganda. You can see it, in particular, from their reporting on Ukraine, where they can&#39;t even keep their own story straight. 9/11 should have tipped me off, but I&#39;m slow.</p>

<p>There are lots of good sources in this very subreddit -- one of the few on Reddit not to have been utterly corrupted. Besides this sub, I like:</p>

<p>I left the country and now live in Costa Rica. Most ex-pats down here, like 90% that I&#39;ve met, share this view. And we&#39;re just scratching the surface.</p>

<p>Where it&#39;s going? Either the Dragon Party will bail us out with gold-backed currency or there will be a complete economic collapse that will take the US and associated countries back to the dark ages. The police state, the FEMA camps, and the guillotines for the poor and the dissenters are already in place. Fascism, martial law, mass starvation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people who claim to be associated with SC have violent interactions with law enforcement.  Is that within SC doctrine?  Is violent conflict inevitable, or necessary?  I&#39;m not assuming you ascribe to these beliefs, I just want to know what you think of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say. I don&#39;t know that I consider myself a &quot;Sovereign Citizen&quot;, per se -- just that the US govt is utterly corrupt and illegitimate, so what&#39;s left?</p>

<p>I can imagine SCs would take exception to a heavily armed person wearing a magic uniform bullying them and threatening them, using fake authority as their justification -- as well they should. I mean, if some stranger started pushing you and your loved ones around the way &quot;police&quot; do, would you be okay with it?</p>
