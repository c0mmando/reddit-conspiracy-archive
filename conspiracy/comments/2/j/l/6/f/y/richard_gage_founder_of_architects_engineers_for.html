       and seems to answer questions which do not stray too far from his field of expertise. Hopefully, who ever accompanies him will broaden the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, here are a couple of questions I would like to ask:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         We know the WTC steel was quickly shipped off--much of it to be recycled--but, what were the most important pieces to analyze for a proper investigation? and what percentage of these pieces were investigators given access to?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wondering if you think the victims (and their families) have been silenced with a non-disclosure agreement which Feinbergâ€™s 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund may have contained...
        </p>

       Anyone can post anything to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as long as they haven't been banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you asked, twice, if anyone can post to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . The answer is yes (twice). Maybe you should read up on how reddit.com works.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're posting to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       right now! Anyone can do it!!

       What's the difference between a hard hitting question and a softball?

      <p>
       You demand people ask hard hitting questions but you have no questions. How do you know the difference between a hard hitting question and a softball if you have no questions?

       I'm not the focal point here. You are demanding hard hitting questions pertaining to Richard Gage yet you don't have any idea what a hard hitting question would be. What's your criteria for a hard hitting question? If you ask for something and you don't know what you're asking for, why ask the  in the first place?

       I don't understand. Scientific consensus means the majority of scientists believe in a thing. Therefore if only out-liers speak against it, it can be accepted as a scientific truth. For instance, gravity, evolution, climate change etc. These things are all agreed on en masse by scientists and only fringe outliers disagree. Due to peer-review and scientists routinely attacking each others papers, I fail to see how the majority could be colluding in secret. I tend to go where a vast majority of scientists goes, especially ones in relevant fields. I feel like it would be hard to lie about such things for very long, because another scientist could make a career off proving you wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fail to see how scientific consensus is not a strong indicator of what is correct, personally. It's obviously been tested repeatedly by many people to come to this conclusion. Kindal like the autism/vaccine thing. We would be able to replicate those findings by now if that was possible.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Especially not with something like climate change, because it is not falsifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some others that aren't falsifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big bang theory (creation mythology)
Evolution of mankind (conception mythology)
Man made climate change (Armageddon mythology)
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions that are too big for us to currently answer with certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean that they aren't the 'best working models that we currently have' which is important and fine.  But let's assume for the sake of discussion that we are wrong about these models in a huge way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big bang theory, if we are very wrong about it then we could be ignoring alternative theories that could lead to a breakthrough that would be immediately benefitial for society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution, If wrong we could piss off god or the aliens. (Who or whatever created us) I can't really think of anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Climate change, if wrong we might end up actually doing one of these hair brained ideas to correct it. Like
       <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2008/sep/04/cloud-seeding-ships-could-combat-climate-change">
        http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2008/sep/04/cloud-seeding-ships-could-combat-climate-change
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And doing something like that could actually cause huge unintended consequences that are more damaging than our normal pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore consensus once held ideas hostage, ideas like the world being a sphere and the earth being the center of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple fact of consensus is that for every Einstein there are a thousand not-so-brilliant scientists who have incorrect ideas and probably won't make any breakthroughs.  Thus the Einsteins of the world could lose the consensus to Mark Wahlberg's character in the happening.  You know, the highschool science teacher who is familiar with old hammered out science of lesser importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consensus is to science what superlatives 'most likely to succeed' are to high school year books.  They are educated guesses by a survey of many people who all have limited information, often times 10 years down the road we laugh or cringe at them.

       Hmm I didn't realise you were a climate change denier when I made my post, sorry if i caused offense. I disagree though and so do almost all credible climate scientists though, why doesn't that seem credible do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       do you think the scientific method is flawed and easily abused? because that, at it's core, is why I don't believe that climate change is alarmism and not based on solid science. It has been constantly proven over and over by the top scientists in the relevant field. Evolution, similarly, is not up for debate. there is evidence for it everywhere.

       I see it differently.

      <p>
       We have a fundamental force to physics, gravity. We know it exist, we can measure its interaction with matter.  We have known it exists since Isaac Newton, arguably much longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing all that we do about it, we can not explain why it exist or how it works.  One force, with one consistent behavior.

       Yet due to consensus we pretend to know beyond a shadow of a doubt why the earth is warming this time.  And I specify this time, because the earth has warmed just like this many times before.  Then it cooled back down, and warmed back up, and cooled back down, etc etc.  Earth has warmed and cooled to the extremes that there were no ice caps at all, and on the other extreme there was relatively narrow channel around the equator that was the the only non frozen part of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two extremes that happened while men were living in caves and the only pollution was from small communal camp fires.  There is even a theory about snowball earth where the entire planet was frozen without exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this time is different, humans are here to explain everything in terms that serve political agendas and as usual government and taxes will save us.  We just need to convince everyone of that before we can get started.

       Do you have anything to back this up in terms of PHD climate scientists agreeing with some kind of consensus? What you are saying is at odds with what climate scientists are unanimously saying - that we have an effect on our climate.

       Showing that the earth has cooled and warmed before doesn't disprove the current consensus theories by climate scientists that we are contributing to global warming.

       Science has nothing to do with politics, and scientists were the ones to discover this. So I don't think this proves anything either. There are plenty of things that benefit either side of politics that are also good for society (for instance, gay marriage. That's a good thing but also serves a political agenda).

       the fact is, we have. It's reached a 97% consensus amongst climate scientists and is something talked about regularly. There was even a massive march for climate change recently. It did
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to start the process. Frankly I don't see how you're not seeing the massive interest energy/gas companies have in denying the science - scientists have no stake in the solar energy industry or anything. The real conspiracy is the big corporations colluding to make sure they don't actually have to do anything to combat the harm they're causing. I don't think big polluters are looking out for our best interest, personally.

       <p>
        The scientific opinion on climate change is that the Earth's climate system is unequivocally warming, and it is extremely likely (at least 95% probability) that humans are causing most of it through activities that increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels.

       That's true, but amongst the public. That doesn't change that there's so few scientists who disagree with the mainstream conclusion (mainstream meaning accepted consensus) that they had to make a list for them on their own wiki page.

       Why are scientists claiming that their papers were misrepresented in the 97% consensus?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the consensus was manufactured by someone who really really really wanted their to be a consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://m.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/05/17/97-percent-of-scientific-studies-agree-on-manmade-global-warming-so-what-now/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here this Washington post article by someone who supports the 97% consensus was forced to come clean (see the update at the top of the article) after the scientific community cried out 'foul play!'.  The update by a AGW supporter admits that 66% of the papers reviewed took no stance at all.  So how can a 97% consensus be had when 66% of the published papers on this subject didn't take a stance?  Easy! Just ignore those papers and the scientists that published them!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that is what I call sound science!  We all know that ignoring data that doesn't agree with the results you wanted to see is a vital part of the scientific method!

       Again, those are all outliers. And I don't really agree that the 97% thing has been debunked as it was found multiple times in multiple studies:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nevertheless, the existence of the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is a reality, as is clear from an examination of the full body of evidence.  For example, Naomi Oreskes found no rejections of the consensus in a survey of 928 abstracts performed in 2004.  Doran &amp; Zimmerman (2009) found a 97% consensus among scientists actively publishing climate research.  Anderegg et al. (2010) reviewed publicly signed declarations supporting or rejecting human-caused global warming, and again found over 97% consensus among climate experts.  Cook et al. (2013) found the same 97% result through a survey of over 12,000 climate abstracts from peer-reviewed journals, as well as from over 2,000 scientist author self-ratings, among abstracts and papers taking a position on the causes of global warming.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why are scientists claiming that their papers were misrepresented in the 97% consensus?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Answer:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There have been a number of contrarians claiming that they are part of the 97% consensus, which they believe is limited to the position that humans are causing some global warming.  The first error in this argument is in ignoring the fact that the data collected in Cook et al. (2013) included categories that quantify the human contribution, as Andrew Montford and the GWPF recently did, for example.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second error has been made by individuals claiming they're in the 97%, but failing to actually check the data.  For example, Roy Spencer claimed in testimony to US Congress that he is included in the 97% consensus.  Since we made all of our data available to the public, you can see our ratings of Spencer's abstracts here. Five of his papers were captured in our literature search; we categorized four as 'no opinion' on the cause of global warming, and one as implicitly minimizing the human influence.  Thus Spencer's research was included in the fewer than 3 percent of papers that either rejected or minimized the human contribution to global warming.  Bjorn Lomborg made a similar error, claiming:
       </p>
       <p>
        "Virtually everyone I know in the debate would automatically be included in the 97% (including me, but also many, much more skeptical)."
       </p>
       <p>
        In reality Lomborg is included neither in the 97+% nor the less than 3% because as far as we can tell, he has not published any peer-reviewed climate research, and thus none of his writings were captured in our literature search.  The 97% is a consensus of climate science experts, and that, Lomborg is not.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just ignore those papers and the scientists that published them!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone is being ignored, that's not how science works. If 50% of scientists disagreed with global warming, we'd know about it. Because science isn't run by liberal politics, that just seems bizarre to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you're saying is that you don't think the scientific method works or exists?

       I can't see any proof of this, however, just claims. the 97% consensus has been investigated repeatedly since "climategate" and no-body has found anything wrong. I really think its just an inevitable push by big oil to make sure nobody realises that they're fucking our planet.

        I'm done with this conversation because you're just repeating yourself over and over again without reading any of the sources I have provided. Its disingenuous, like the consensus on climate change, you're ignoring all contrary information.

       i disagree and don't think you really read anything I was saying either. But all the best anyway, we can agree to disagree as to whether the scientific method is abuseable or not.

       Good one. Keep repeating it and it might be true. Just be sure not to provide any information backing up your claim. That tends to get in the way.

       Pretty sure the art of a skeptic is not to settle into any one notion. I'm willing to argue both sides of the argument - but the only way you can do that without waving your dick is bringing sources to the table.

       That has nothing to do with my comment, but I will reply accordingly: literally no one. I've called my senators, my governor, my mayor, and emailed the appropriate offices. I have never received anything short of "thank you for your input."

        gone to DC

       to lobby congressman and Senators on Capital Hill regarding their cause, so my question was geared to them.  You said let's "compile good questions to ask" and that was my effort to put one forth.  I hope it gets asked on Friday because I'm interested to know if any of the congressman or Senators they met with were receptive to the presentation or information.

       There is no such thing as a CIA whistleblower. Susan Lindauer is disinformation. She has no evidence for anything she says.

      <p>
       Please provide Susan's proof for any of her claims. Otherwise you are peddling CIA disinformation.

       You run a non-profit with a mission statement declaring to fund research and papers to show 9/11 was an inside job. So why is it that when we look at your tax records we see all the money going into paying yourself nearly $100,000 annually + accommodations + meals and the rest going into promoting your DVD's while not a single cent goes towards any research or funding any studies whatsoever?

       Many non-profits pay salaries to their employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example the SPLC
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.thesocialcontract.com/answering_our_critics/southern_poverty_law_center_splc_info.html">
        http://www.thesocialcontract.com/answering_our_critics/southern_poverty_law_center_splc_info.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm using the SPLC as an example because it is typically worshiped by the very people trying to discredit Gage.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (the SPLCâ€™s 2010 tax filing lists a compensation package of
        <strong>
         $345,000
        </strong>
        for him [Morris Dees] as the organizationâ€™s chief trial counsel and highest-paid employee)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So if the SPLC can be taken seriously with a salary of over a quarter million dollars than Mr. Gage can be taken seriously with his 80,000 dollar salary.

       It's not whether non-profit employees should be paid a high income, it's whether Gage is doing the right thing by pocketing money he claimed goes towards research.

       Yes that's how non profits work. People work for them, not for free, the company doesn't make a profit.  The corporation doesn't work for profit, it works for a cause.  The employees still get paid, and in most cases much better than Gage is getting paid.
      </p>

       This is a non issue.  Its an attempt at character assassination.

       If Gage was paying himself 345,000 dollars per year while claiming to be a champion of poor victimised minorities (like Morris dees) then it might matter.

       Wrong. He made around 4.6 billion from the unsurance settlements, 4b of which went right back into OWTC. Considering he has to pay the Port Authority 102 million a year for the lease (adding up to over 1.3 billion dollars), he lost a significant amount of money overall,

       Not sure, but the rent and insurance figures were public information. It's certainly clear that, at least as far as 9/11 and the insurance, goes, he lost a lot of money. He didn't have enough to build the OWTC and had to stop construction multiple times to acquire more funds.

       Because I believe it to be true, and feel the evidence points that way, for the most part. This is a sub for the discussion of conspiracy theories, and I regularly see false facts and misconceptions (such as what you just posted) purported as truth.

       Again, as I previously discussed, this is not the whole story. He lost the appeal and only received about 4.6bn in settlement for the entire complex. Also, as I stated previously, OWTC cost about 4bn to build. Silverstein also had to reconstruct buildings 2, 3, and 4 (and perhaps 5?). Taking into account the rent he has to pay the Port Authority, at 102m a year, it's clear with a little math that he lost a significant chunk of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, let's do it together.
      </p>
      <p>
       4,550,000,000
      </p>
      <p>
       - 4,000,000,000 (cost of OWTC)
      </p>
      <p>
       - 1,326,000,000 (102m x 13 years)
      </p>
      <p>
       = -776,000,000
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's not including construction costs for the other three buildings, or the loss of rent he would have gained. So please, drop the constant childish insults and tell me how he made any money off this whatsoever.

         The tower's construction was partly funded with approximately $1 billion of insurance money recouped by Silverstein in connection with the September 11 attacks.
        </strong>
        The State of New York provided $250 million toward construction costs, and the Port Authority agreed to finance a further $1 billion through the sale of bonds. A series of bridge and tunnel toll hikes were also implemented by the Port Authority to raise funds, with a 56 percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015; however, the proceeds of these toll hikes were not ultimately used to pay for the tower's construction.

       His strategy is to stick VERY CLOSELY to the scientific evidence and so he refuses to speculate. That was a year ago, so I do not know if he has had time to study the issue and 'evolve' on it yet or not.

       <p>
        One of the observations that seems to have motivated Wood to come up with her directed energy weapon hypothesis is that the debris pile at Ground Zero does not seem to be tall enough to contain enough steel to equal what was in the Twin Towers before they came down. She departs from verifiable fact quite early with this claim. FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, performed the first technical review of what brought down the Twin Towers and WTC 7. Even in its report, FEMA acknowledges (inconveniently for the official story, which cannot account for this fine destruction of the Twin Towers) that roughly 90% of the Twin Towers' mass fell outside their footprints. Indeed, the entire plaza was covered with steel pieces and assemblies. Some of the structural steel was thrown as far away as the Winter Gardens â€“ 600 feet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given all this, there is no reason to expect a taller debris pile at Ground Zero than the photographs show. Wood's belief that some of the steel must have been turned into dust rests on a completely spurious interpretation of the visual evidence. Her hypothesis is an attempt to solve a nonexistent problem.

       <p>
        The scientific method requires us to look at all the available evidence and then assess various explanations for their ability to account for the evidence.

"Basically, gravity and the utter force of the upper floors forced the towers down," said NIST spokesperson Michael Newman.

       I appreciate your link. I didn't know they addressed Judy Wood and her theories, and I actually enjoyed reading their statement to that effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm really quite taken aback by how confrontational you're being.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       should know better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it was the unspoken rule of this place that everything goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be free to speculate about what we please and post whatever harebrained conspiracy under the sun (as long as we follow the rules of reddit, naturally!).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wanted to "discredit" me, you should've taken the time to actually go further back in my history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've posted thousands of links to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , quite literally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I submit things I completely disagree with,
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       to stimulate conversation. It's fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holy shit, if I was beholden to
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       single post I've ever submitted to this sub...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I looked through your history and you have also been peddling these over the top theories
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, you did a lazy job if you were trying to discredit me.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       post on a topic possibly equate with "peddling"? That's really too much. Doesn't "peddling" require, I don't know, at least two posts?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't
       <em>
        personally
       </em>
       believe that Nancy Lanza is this Anne Haddad character, I was more interested with the fact that this video keeps getting removed from youtube for "content inappropriate" reasons (and no, it wasn't for copyright violation like some have claimed).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I posted that particular link. I'm very interested in free speech...I'm one of those defend to the death your right to say shit types, which may be part of the reason why I ended up as moderator for this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm really baffled why you would regret nominating me for mod. Again, take the time to go through my history...I've posted all sorts of crazy shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I honestly don't see what one post has anything to do with how I perform my duties as a moderator here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I even need to mention that I personally arranged the last AMA, and helped put this one together too?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've spent countless hours putting together material on dozens of topics just for the sole benefit of the users of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know how many threats I've received? I've stopped counting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that's fun? Do you think I enjoy my family being threatened?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I said was I was curious what Richard Gage thought about Judy Wood.
      </p>
      <p>
       You provided the answer, for which I'm grateful. But you could've just left it there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really expect people to equate an offhanded remark about Judy Wood with me "pushing her theories" on this sub? Have I ever posted anything about Judy Wood? Did you even bother to check?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's up with you? You obviously have an auspicious user name.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've put together an AMA with Richard Gage for this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's absolutely no reason it should devolve into the tired old meta drama that plagues reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've put in a great deal of time for this place, much more than I'd probably like to admit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I've done this sub justice, and if I haven't yet, I will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing sucky about that.

       No sources and absolutely ridiculous titles. How can you be a mod of the Ben Swann subreddit and peddle bogus and discrediting material?  He is the epitome of a real investigator and uses sources to stir up discussion.  You do the opposite by throwing in this HAARP Sandy Hoax Super hero kids bullshit. I care about credibility, considering I work with Gage, 9/11 blogger, abby martin and others.  Having proof and sources are priority #1.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Fulford is the comedian of the conspiracy research community.

      <p>
       I've never supported a
       <em>
        single
       </em>
       claim of his.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I've submitted dozens of his blog posts for the sake of discussion on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       <a href="/r/conspiratard">

       (bipolarbear actually!) even tried to discredit me the

        same
       </em>
       way you're doing...they found a Fulford submission from several years ago I had posted and tried to claim that I
       <em>
        believed
       </em>
       every word Fulford wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say, I spoke up in that
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       thread and pointed out how absurd it is to claim that I supported all of Fulford's insanity because I posted to his blog.
      </p>
      <p>
       My explanation was soundly upvoted, even in

       I find it interesting that both you and bipolarbear0 used the exact same method to try and "discredit" me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second link you provided is the same scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's from writer Joseph P Farrell. I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       respect Farrell much more than Fulford, but I still disagree with him frequently. And yes, IT'S OK TO POST STUFF TO THIS SUB THAT YOU DISAGREE WITH.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how many times I have to say that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I started
       <a href="/r/benswann">
        /r/benswann
       </a>
       a few years back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also started
       <a href="/r/josephpfarrell">
        /r/josephpfarrell
       </a>
       . Check it out. I post pretty much all of his blogs to that sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if I think he's assertions are stupid, or as he likes to call it, "high octane speculation."
      </p>
      <p>
       I love Ben Swann. But I also like high octane speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what this sub is about, a healthy mixture of the rational speculation and the high octane.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one but
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       (well and bipolarbear, but he doesn't really count) is going through my history to try and discredit me. No one cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most folks here realize that we are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       beholden to the content in
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       submission we've ever made. This is true for the mods as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to keep perusing my history. I'm sure you'll find many more examples to be "disappointed" about.

       I only wish, for the love of God, and people everywhere, that for this AMA, it wasn't Richard Gage alone, but A&amp;E for 9/11 Truth (as a panel) who were conducting this, so that we can deal with the science involved, and not any personal attacks, with all kinds of posts deleted all over the place for going off topic or violating rules and it would also make it so much easier on Richard himself, with the opportunity to answer so many more questions, along various threads or branches of the AMA which is sure to unfold and bifurcate as the debate unfolds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents for whatever it's worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       AMA with a panel of real live architects and engineers, scientists and physics teachers (David Chandler?).
      </p>
      <p>
       OMG that would be so awesome because it's also sure to hit the front page in a hurry.

       Edit: You could call it an AUA (ask us anything), and Richard could "hand off" various questions to others in the panel.

       It's possible that Richard Gage will be joined by others. We won't get the confirmation until the day of, unfortunately. That's why we billed it as just Gage...didn't want to make any false promises.

       Thanks.

       Richard's no dummy, he knows what the analytics are like for reddit (provided it hits the front page, which it will).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I also know about him is that he's meek and insecure enough to make darn sure that the AMA isn't really about "him" at all, but the evidence and the findings and the science, and at the same time he's always looking for that home run shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be wise to present it as a panel though and not just Richard mediating the responses, but either way he'll be surrounded by a large team of people reading to provide info, I just wish they would all step right into the ensuring debate itself, all of them or all the main ones, just show up and really give it to the trolls and so-called "skeptics" (that's so ironic) and "debunkers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Bring it on!
      </p>
      <p>
       The framework of the AMA and the debate is critical, everyone knows that and Richard's a smart man and not an egotist or narcissist who wants to make this about himself and allow the discussion to devolve into responses and reactions to personal attacks against him and the folks he represents - what a missed opportunity THAT would be..
      </p>
      <p>
       He'll be well supported I'm sure however they choose to run this thing on Friday afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt very much that Gage alone will show up and then just "wing it" that's not what I would expect and hope for from this upcoming AMA (AUA?).

       It's going to be EPIC, how this plays itself out on reddit, leaving in its wake a
historical trail or track, on the one hand, of well thought out science and
basic observation, common sense and reason (no matter what the
implications ie: dedicated to truth and reality as it is), and on the
other, little more than ridicule and all manner of baseless
speculations and assumptions founded on nothing but incredulity at the
implications of the evidence being presented and debated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's play our cards right, all of us on the side of truth and reality, in our approach to this
upcoming AMA, and get all our points lined up and ready to roll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the level headed and the rational win out, with nothing but the
plain as day truth of the matter under observation - the destruction
of the Twin Towers of the WTC (and Building 7) on 9/11 remaining in stark contrast to the certain willful ignorance we're going to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the truth ring out loud and clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       ..rendered as it really was, as it actually occurred, including the
firemen transcripts, the works.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious, self evident, no matter how painful or difficult it
might be to imagine or contemplate. So there's also the psychological
factor to consider.

       I feel for Gage as all the conspiratards will be out in full force and by that I'm not referring to official story skeptics but the devil's advocates (literally) willing to go to any lengths to bend reality to fit with the official theory about how the twin towers and building 7 "collapsed", which is clearly absurd, given the way and the manner in which they were destroyed, all three buildings.

        I'm very serious about this,

         so unless you want me to start accusing you of being a part of a very serious crime (conspiracy to commit torture) and the criminal cover up of 9/11,

         you need to back off of me now.
        </strong>
        I have been arguing with Bush's torture team for many years now, so I can recognize their style very easily. They do not want the truth about 9/11 to be revealed. They get really hysterical in their attacks on me when they feel threatened. I really hope you are not a part of that, but you sure are starting to look like it.
