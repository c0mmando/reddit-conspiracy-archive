After reading a recent thread where a cop murdered a dog, (yes, very fucked up) I was shocked to find the majority of users calling for the torture and or execution of the cop. One user who presented logical arguments about how the cop should lose his job, receive jail time, and have to go through extensive therapy was downvoted to hell.  My point is, calling for the killing and torture of a person who killed a dog doesn&#39;t make you much better than the person who killed the dog, even if that person is a piece of shit cop. </p>

Once person here brought up a conspiracy that cops are trained to kill dogs to test the public. That&#39;s a conspiracy, that warrants discussion. Instead all I see is, &quot;save a dog, shoot a cop.&quot; I bet none of those people would actually shoot the cop if they were handed him bound and a loaded pistol.

Shortly after that I decided I was spending too much time on the internet in general and a big part of me taking care of that was deleting my reddit account. I just recently started coming back to reddit occasionally. The change I&#39;ve noticed in this place since then is pretty drastic. No good discussion and tons of group think. This is less conspiracy and more general corruption discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sooo...what? Do you want attention by announcing your departure? I see you berating others for not contributing to your discussion, but why should they care if  you are leaving anyway?</p>

<p>It&#39;s been my experience through my 20+ years of participating in online discussion forums that people who announce their departure are kind of drama queens and they don&#39;t really want to leave. They want to see if people care about their departure or they want to air a grievance to the community about the problems of the community they are participating in.</p>

<p>Rarely do they <em>really</em> leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is killing a friendly dog is actually worse than killing a person. You might not agree but take a moment to see another perspective; a dog is considered man&#39;s best friend because they have been domesticated before civilization even took root. Now dogs are so ingrained with trust and loyalty to man that will forgive a person for any injustice that is done to them, that is pure innocence and being a complete subject to man. People are not innocent, not one person is completely innocent of doing harm, while the act of killing a person is anti-humanism it is nowhere near the power or act of disgust in killing an innocent loyal creature known as the canine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think punishment as an idea is moral at all. We put people in jail so they can&#39;t cause any more harm, not to harm them as a revenge. Punishing someone as revenge is just sating your own bloodlust. Of course, sometimes it might be required that someone be killed for the safety of others, even in this case the motive should be to protect, not to punish. This is how I feel on the subject. Also, don&#39;t throw terms like &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;good&quot; around, since that&#39;s all completely subjective. An eye for an eye doesn&#39;t actually help at all, what does it cause? The first eye won&#39;t grow back, and the attacker losing an eye doesn&#39;t really affect anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Punishment is totally moral. There should be both a punitive and rehabilitative component to deal with crimes. It doesn&#39;t have to be revenge or eye for an eye. For example - it could just be negative reinforcement like losing certain privileges or rights - you know like being confined in prison. While hopefully getting some counseling and rehabilitation.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think punishment as an idea is moral at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the most idiotic thing I have read all day.</p>

<p>How is it not moral to teach another human being that there are consequences for their actions?</p>

<p>Do you not understand how punishment works?</p>

<p>People who lack discipline go around being lawless, reckless, and displaying a complete and total lack of any form of regard for the well being of others.</p>

<p>If you do not discipline these people through punishing their bad behavior, their bad behavior will continue to run rampant.</p>

<p>It is through discipline which is aided by punishment that we are able to attempt to correct these bad behaviors, and it does not have to be accomplished through physical means, though there are certainly extremely appropriate times in which to use the appropriate physical punishment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We put people in jail so they can&#39;t cause any more harm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is only one reason, because remember that they are supposed to be CORRECTIONAL facilities, the point is for the people going there to realize that they need to correct their behaviors which lead them to become imprisoned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Punishing someone as revenge is just sating your own bloodlust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is called the abuse of power, any abuse of power is wrong, but punishment in and of itself is not wrong or immoral.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, don&#39;t throw terms like &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;good&quot; around, since that&#39;s all completely subjective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL No. Good and Evil is not all completely subjective, murder is evil and is wrong, theft is evil and is wrong, purposely causing others emotional harm is evil and wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An eye for an eye doesn&#39;t actually help at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And nobody thinks that it does besides that dumbass Hammurabi and that old fuck ass is long dead.</p>

<p>Just like Descartes, moron can&#39;t even distinguish between dreaming and reality, so why even listen to a single word that dumbass has to say about anything? Especially ethics and philosophy, you want to take that idiots opinions on ethics and philosophy when he says we can&#39;t even truly determine whether or not we are dreaming or in reality?</p>

<p>This is too easy, you all have to up your game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My argument is this. I like to deal with reality, and the reality is the punishments I described are probably much more than what will actually happen. Loss of job and future good jobs, felony charge, say 5 years in jail (in solitary), and daily therapy. None of that will probably happen, so calling for the killing of this guy... I just don&#39;t understand. Also, who&#39;s going to pull the trigger; you? Who would be tasked with shooting the guy and how would they feel about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do completely agree with you. However, do realize that the first step required for any of these changes to actually happen, is for people to work with each other. We all feel weak and helpless because there is nothing we can do as individuals, and we don&#39;t have the connection with others, to demand any actual change like you have proposed. </p>

<p>People only care for themselves these days, and don&#39;t wish to work alongside people who hold different opinions... which makes it impossible to form any kind of unified resistance. With less jobs and increasing struggles in our lives, people are only going to get more divided and selfish. We have to work towards changing that - towards teaching people the importance of accepting differences, and working towards a world that we all want. </p>

<p>I actually created a sub <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedWeStand">/r/UnitedWeStand</a> that is build for this purpose, and the sooner we work towards accomplishing this, the sooner we can demand and make changes happen in our communities. </p>

<p>SO, when it &quot;appears&quot; that many users are expressing hateful sentiments, and they are all low level worthless no effort &quot;kill that pig!&quot; type of comments, in the same thread where other reasonable comments get massively downvoted, it is then reasonable to assume that these &quot;murder cops&quot; people are largely shills and trolls trying to discredit this sub through the appearance of a murderous user base.</p>

<p>A dog? &quot;<em>Kill him</em>&quot;</p>

<p>They want us to hate them, disrespect them, attack them, so that they can justify force.

<p>I try to remember they&#39;re still people like us, I mean I could go be a cop right now. As soon as that happens is as soon as I pick up all the hatred that ONE cop far away generated from all the people.</p>

<p>Cops honestly should be on high alert and prepared to shoot. People are on edge. I can&#39;t just go to the gas station without getting dirty looks from everyone, and see everyone look at everyone that way. You can tell they&#39;re ready to defend themselves. </p>

<p>No they should not. Them being more prepared to shoot will only lead to more unjustified shootings of innocent people which will lead to more cop hatred and violence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more about the fact that the cop made the conscious choice to harm, and that is what is being called into question.  It&#39;s worse that he chose to enact that harm on a trusting creature, which just adds to the evidence that this cop is a terrible person before and after the act. I think people really want his personality punished, with this as proof to his deserving, than just &#39;he killed a dog&#39; but I don&#39;t think people even truly understand why it makes them so hot under the collar. If you look at it that way, it seems less obtuse that people could be so angry and want him punished.  The act speaks to the larger problem of his personality being someone who does this, consciously and with enthusiasm, and <em>that</em> mentality is deserving of severe punishment in their minds. Not just one event, but the context of that event coupled with the fact that this man acted indiscriminately toward a perceived innocent and trusting animal, is disgusting.  He made his choice, he acted out violence towards another creature willfully.  He didn&#39;t panic in a stressful situation like a cop on a call could.  He didn&#39;t accidentally shoot the dog and remorse about it later. He didn&#39;t shoot the dog in self-defense after it attacked him. He made the choice to act like a psychopath and having his badge taken away is not enough. If he can do this to a dog, who says he&#39;ll stop there? It&#39;s about WHO he is, and people are correlating it with WHAT he did. If it were any of the other scenarios above, I&#39;d think the people were fucking disgusting idiots for their comments too. However,it in this case, it&#39;s hard to justify that the cop wasn&#39;t out of line and that people&#39;s reactions aren&#39;t over the top.</p>

This sub is an absolute joke the very idea of &quot;free thinkers&quot; is shit on.

<p>My sister for example, is of the vegan/PETA crowd and often says ridiculous things about what she would do to anyone who hurts animals whether they are a cop or not. She is overly emotional in her responses, but she is however also a grounded person and a pacifist who would never do anything violent in real life. What she does do all the time is run her mouth to anyone who will listen, much like the people of reddit.</p>

I don&#39;t condone animal cruelty or malice, I think all living things are meant to have the same respect regardless.  There are only two acceptable reasons for violence in my opinion, one being in self defense or in the defense of another who is helpless, the other to feed.  Other than that, it&#39;s quite disgusting and in violation of basic natural rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t really blame people for valuing the lives of animals above people. Community atmosphere was killed in the West a long time ago. People stopped identifying with each other for individuality and isolation followed. A lot of people are disconnected from society because society is, today, a social engineering project. This brings out the worst in people in general from materialism to ignorance and greed. The human animal is the most horrifying on Earth.</p>

<p>As for cops or what they really are, statute enforcers or street security guards, they aren&#39;t exactly out there protecting people and they are sure doing more harm than anything else. They&#39;ve become so pointless and bloated they are out there murdering children and dogs. I can&#39;t really feel bad if some of them die. There may be good-hearted cops, but we only see the corruption and what these good-hearted cops allow. Evil is to be able to do something and not do it. </p>

<p>I do feel bad for the family&#39;s and the pets who have become victims of over-funding of these mere security guards. Let&#39;s face it, they aren&#39;t detectives and this isn&#39;t CSI. The police are nothing more than a response team. People call them when something bad happens and they show up to document the scene like field data entry clerks. But today they are becoming more and more intrusive and like speed bumps, they kill more people than they save. They are becoming judge, jury and executioner. We don&#39;t need a bunch of Judge Dredds roaming the streets being proactive. We need them to do their jobs. The police should be invisible until needed, not terrorists.</p>

If you believe the animal is a person&#39;s property, he&#39;s a thief via property destruction. Regardless, I think it&#39;s clear animals are not typical property. They feel, think and love freedom, hate being caged, just like you, me and everyone else. It&#39;s cruel to kill just to kill. It&#39;s a power struggle. Idk, it&#39;s sticky, but fuck him.

    <div class="md"><p>This and the comments in the other thread all boil down to a lack of empathy.  Yes the police officer made the wrong call and should be held responsible.  But you are right in believing that killing the officer as a response is extreme.  We have to remember that police are humans too, with families and friends outside their job.  You said it in another comment here; killing this officer makes us no better than him. ;-)</p>

<p>Also, for those of you calling for blood, what is more cruel; put a bullet in him or publicly shame him with a trial and verdict that will follow him around the rest of his life and jail him (placing him in an environment not conducive to those in his profession).  Somehow the bullet seems like a mercy to me.</p>

<p>Or maybe your a piece that my girlfriend uses to wrap her used tampons in.. either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kinda saw your comments and tone coming when I was swyping my reply.</p>

<p>All I really have to say about it is, &quot;Don&#39;t start nothin, won&#39;t be nothin&quot;. I put a high price tag on taking someone else&#39;s life, unfortunately for people with your mindset, that list includes taking the life of someone I love dearly. My dog is family, I&#39;d do the same for him as I would my own.</p>

<p>Yeah, obviously  circumstances need to come into account, I wouldn&#39;t defend the grossly guity such as my dog attacking someone. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious as to how you would punish someone whose taken the life of your dog, assuming you&#39;ve had/have one?</p>

<p>Nope. There must be true repentance. Or you still end up suffering punishment/damnation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;No they&#39;re not. Some are Israeli-trained, not &quot;all&quot;. &quot;</p>

<p>Oh yeah, just &quot;some&quot; doesn&#39;t make it weird at all. Same with having a branch of the NYPD in Israel. Totally not weird at all.</p>

<p>A country that&#39;s home to Intel chip manufacturing, research and design also happens to get 8 million dollars a day in &quot;aid&quot; from the US are you really surprised it&#39;s in the mix on this sub?</p>
