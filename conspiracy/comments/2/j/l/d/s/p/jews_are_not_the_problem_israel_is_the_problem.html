       The use of Jews as a scapegoat for many events is extremely prevalent. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you hear about a crime, is your first instinct to blame the person's gender, skin color, or nationality? No. Your instinct is to investigate their personal circumstances, their state of mind. You can't generalize a group of people based on what people in that group do.

       The list of controversies regarding Israel stretch for miles. Israel's government is the problem- not their people. That is like blaming U.S. citizens for the U.S. government bombing Syria, or Hiroshima, or any other big event in our history. That is not the decision of the common man. It is the government.

       You are correct.

       The government which has led Israel for decades is pro-zionism. This is a fact:

       Anyone can be a zionist- it's simply a matter of ideology. One needs to look no further than Wikipedia to realize this:

       You have to understand their entire country is educated by this same group of people you are saying are the problem. they are essentially their children.... just like hitler youth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can raise entire generations of people to believe any nonsensical garbage you please, and then like we've seen in pictures in this subreddit recently, you can hand machine guns and rocket launchers to 10 year old girls, build illegal walls, fake anti-missile defense systems etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the people who complacently accept this as their identity and culture aren't at fault, what purpose do they serve other than as murderers to the IDF? Since...they are forced into that, much like their way of thought as well....

       How do you rehabilitate "extremists?" Ask the leader of Israel and I'm sure he'd tell you ;)

       I wish people would get this and understand the history of Zionism.(most books on the subject get blacklisted) It's not that different than Nazi-ism with it's treatment of Palestinians for example, racial purity doctrine, ruthlessness and perceived superiority to the rest of humanity.

       Zionism existed before the rise of Nazism, and continues to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be argued that Nazism would never have come into being were it not for the backroom workings of the Zionists.

       Does Zionism resemble Nazism, or is it the other way around?

       Yep, remember that the extremely religious, orthodox jews, were actually opposed to the concept of a secular Israel, because it goes completely against their reading of scripture, which says that the Jews cannot have a state until the Messiah comes.

       Some of them believe that a war between Israel and the rest of the Near East nations is necessary for the return of Christ, and they are hoping they can hustle God along a bit by creating that war.

       I am a Sephardic Jew. I am spit on by "real" (Ashkenazi) Jews. This has ONLY happened in Israel; never in the states.

       I work with Jewish, Catholic, Hindi, Buddhist, Taoist, and Islamic pilots. We all get along famously and our love of aviation conquers all. We all respect each other and have great friendships. Without fail every Ashkenazi Jew I ask about Israel says something like--"Well, it was a good idea after the war but NOBODY told me or my family that OTHER people were being forced from their homes and killed so that Israel would be a Jewish country. They simply told us that, after WWII,

      </p>
      <p>
       Well, to them, "nobody" did live there anymore. Just "beasts on two legs" (Menachem Begin). The people that DID buy into the propaganda moved to Israel and now live in a terrorist apartheid state but, as long as you're Jewish, it's not bad. You go right through the checkpoints that hold up Arabs for hours, you are smiled at by the IDF guards--the same ones that kick the Arab children as they walk past--maybe knock them in the head with the stock of their M16s if they're feeling
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       exuberant.
      </p>
      <p>
       EVERY ONE of my Jewish friends abhors Israel's policies--they utterly hate them--yet what do they do? If they speak up they're a "self-hating Jew" and they'll lose their job and worse. If they don't they feel that they are party to murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's just make this clear--ISRAEL DOES NOT SPEAK FOR ANYTHING NEAR
       <em>
        ALL JEWS.
       </em>
       Some Jews are Zionists and Israel and its terror is just fine with them. But MOST Jews in America are NOT ARDENT ZIONISTS.
      </p>
      <p>
       So lighten up--we've no plot to take over. Sure, our (ALL of our) masters almost certainly do--but us ordinary Jewish guys just work all day to pay the credit card bills, our car loans, our mortgage, and for clothes for our kids. We hate this Zionist crap. It makes US and our families look bad. Sure, Israel does horrible things--including running a spy ring to spy on the USA that would have been the USSR's wet dream in 1988. But
       <em>
        we have nothing to do with this bullshit
       </em>
       . Sadly, other Jews (I'm looking at YOU Sergey Brin and Mark Fuckerberg) fall right into the stereotype--while stealing YOUR entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, it's simply divide and conquer--oldest trick in the book--and my kids know this too. DON'T fall for it. It's billshit--and
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what the socialist Obama government wants.

       You made so much sense until you called Obama a socialist. But maybe your goal

       This is such an important perspective that never gets much, if any mention in the Zionist controlled media (100+ years of control and counting). What is also worth noting is that some of the most brutal Zionists (Ben-Gurion, Begin, Sharon, Meir, etc) are selected as their Prime Ministers and the one who did want to foster peace (Rabin) was assassinated.

       No, you are wrong. The reason Israel has power in the United States, the only reason, is that wealthy and powerful American Jews enable Israel. After all, what is Israel, but a nation of Jews? They will even tell you this themselves. They don't want blacks, they don't want Arabs, they don't want any non-Jews there. Jews are the problem, and Israel is a

       Are you positive that Jews are the problem, and not the symptom? After all, powerful governments- throughout history -have used their people to enact their will. Whether they were willing, able, or even knowing is an entirely different story.

       Pretty sure, yes. I've been looking at this issue for years now, and it only fall out one way. Jews have the leadership they have because they want that leadership. Zionism exists because Jews want it to exist. They like Zionism overall, although there are dissenting Jewish voices from Jews who don't want Israel to exist. It wasn't an accident that Jews took complete control over our  media. It wasn't an accident that Jews gained control over Congress. Jews target key power points in Christian society so that they can gain control over non-Jews. It's a Jewish thing ... but I will qualify it by saying that it is an Ashkenazi Jewish thing, to want to control and  dominate the lives of Christians.

       I thought it was "only" 112?
      </p>
      <p>
       My Jewish grandpa said if best (its an old Yiddish proverb)--"If one person calls you a donkey, forget it. If two people call you a donkey, they're probably jealous of something. If
       <em>
        three
       </em>
       people call you a donkey, you'd better start shopping for a saddle."
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're saying that 120 people have "called the Jewish population donkeys?" Wow.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can safely say that, most likely, 120 was NOT a mistake. Two or three may have been. But we also don't know the prevailing attitude of people towards Jews back then. The last expulsion, I'm guessing, was Germany circa 1936?

       It's seems to be the Ashkenazi, or European, Jews who have historically been the problem in Europe. Maybe at times the Sephardic Jews got caught up in the surge of anger against the Ashkenazi Jews. I mean, if you look at the Jews living peacefully for centuries in Iran, for example, I don't think anyone views them as a threat or a problem to anyone else. It's these psychopathic fucks who came out of Germany and Poland and surrounding countries that have always been the problem. They always want to take over and control non-Jews. They can't help themselves.

       Okay, hear me out. I want to put into perspective the powers that Jews, as a people, have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly two-thousand years ago, the Jews were completely bred out of existence by the Phillistines. At that point in time, the Jews literally ceased to be, both as a religion and as a race, because according to God, Judaism was a race first and a religion second and anyone not racially Jewish, was not a Jew religiously, as they could not be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite this, they were somehow able to use what little bloodline they had, to pass down their ultra cryptic religion for so long, that they were able to convince the world that they were still a people in modern times, despite the fact that even their own god disowned them for interbreeding with the Phillistines.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a group of people whose ancient ancestors, of whom were
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       Jews, were capable of convincing these people to spread their religion down the line, until today, upon which the occupied state of Palestine was created.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's depressing, is that multiple genetic tests have shown that the current "Jews" in Israel, are racially identical to Palestinians. In other words, a group of people that don't exist, were capable of convincing the world that they did exist, and were able to steal someone else's land in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is not Israel, it's not Jews, it's the people calling themselves "Jews". It's the nonexistent, fictitious group of people that have created a monopoly on media and have dipped their tentacles into every major business venture and who are behind all the current problems in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're right, the problem isn't a race of people called the Jews, who ceased to be two-thousand years ago, the problem is a race of people calling themselves the "Jews".

       Last year, I read a great book on the matter, at the same time the E. Ghouta chemical weapons attacks occurred in Syria. It was called
       <em>
        Israel and Palestine; a 4000 Year History
       </em>
       , and it was extremely neutral on the matter but opened my eyes to some new things I'd never known about the Israel-Palestine conflict and I chose it because all the other books I found on the matter, had names like "Israel is Right and here's why- Written by Shlomo Morenstein". I highly recommend you read it.

       I will look into (as in: read) the books you've named, and I have much respect for Shlomo- so I won't take what you've said with a grain of salt, but I will be cautious upon taking them as fact.

       Oh. I assumed you were talking about a different Shlomo (the scholar, whose last name I don't know and for some reason can't find through Google). He's an outspoken critic of Israel policy, if that helps.

       Israel is a front for the secret government of international financial elites. Look up the Balfour declaration. The Rothschild family helped create Israel. They
       <em>
        supposedly
       </em>
       own a large part of it. It works toward what they want covertly. The motto of the Mossad is by deception make war. Israel is a convenient scapegoat for the international elites to use to misdirect those that realize it is linked to so much of the bullshit in this world. They also use the Holocaust and the label of antisemitism to silence criticism of it. They love to use proxies of power that shield them from public scrutiny. It's about time we identify these financial parasites for who they really are and stop being so manipulated by their proxies and tactics. They are very clever indeed. They get us to slave away for God damned pieces of paper and computer digits they can create in perpetuity. Our government and us get debt to them and they get to control our species and enjoy the fruits of our collective toil and sacrifices. We have to stop them before they effectively lock down the western world with contrived draconian legislation for increased surveillance, increased government and police power, and decreased rights for the citizenry. This is our planet and our future, fuck these parasites.

       I agree that the people are not
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       to blame, but I do think their religion deserves close scrutiny.  Forget the barbarous act of circumcision (especially through use of teeth) or protocols for which the Talmud grants pedophilia...
       <strong>
        Israel was set up as a Jewish state
       </strong>
       .  Religious Zionists believe a historically inaccurate notion that the land of Palestine belongs to them.  This kind of mentality breeds tribalism (even among atheist Jews); It's exclusionary and racist against natives to that region.  I think this explains a lot of the public's support for settlement expansion and brutalization of the the Palestinians.  So while it is the Israeli government that is guilty of implementing such heinous acts, it's not like the people are as opposed as

       The Israeli government is to blame for the majority of the mess.  While I am ascribing blame, I would be remiss not to bring up America's funding, fused unshakable bond, and all of our UN vetoes.

       As a Sephardic Jew I can say that I really liked how this thread worked out, and learned some things too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It cracks me up that asswipes like the ones over at
       <a href="/r/conspiritard">

       are trolling this sub and putting threads like this up and are commenting "...what a bunch of assholes--listen to this load of crap..."

      <p>
       There IS a "Jewish Problem" in America and most (if not all) of it is because of complete Jewish control of the Congress through AIPAC, the same (and Obama gets it too) through the ADL, Jewish total control of high finance, Jewish complete control of Hollywood and the media...I'm Jewish and, man, to think that such a small number of the total US population controls SO much of what I see and do...its wrong. NO GROUP should have that "monopoly." But what to do; tribal allegiance is not illegal and these "dual citizens" are usually loyal to Israel first...and are proud to say that they are! So what to do? Anything???
      </p>
      <p>
       And to think, in most countries its illegal to even post this! Now
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is raw power...should any group have access to this kind of power?
      </p>

       The people here have proven that there can be discourse about Jews and Israel
       <em>
        without

       people playing the anti-semite card. Again.

       I don't understand what Israel does. I'm not sure why they do it. But whatever happens, I know that they were chosen by God to be an example to the human race of His steadfast love of us all. I believe He picked the Jews because of many flaws and strengths of the Jewish people in order to prove to humanity His love and grace. Am I a zionist?

       It's seems to be the Ashkenazi, or European, Jews who have historically been the problem in Europe. Maybe at times the Sephardic Jews got caught up in the surge of anger against the Ashkenazi Jews. I mean, if you look at the Jews living peacefully for centuries in Iran, for example, I don't think anyone views them as a threat or a problem to anyone else. It's these psychopathic fucks who came out of Germany and Poland and surrounding countries that have always been the problem. They always want to take over and control non-Jews. They can't help themselves.

       Zionism existed before the rise of Nazism, and continues to exist.

       It could be argued that Nazism would never have come into being were it not for the backroom workings of the Zionists.

       Does Zionism resemble Nazism, or is it the other way around?
