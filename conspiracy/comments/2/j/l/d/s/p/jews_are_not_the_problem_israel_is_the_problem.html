<p>The list of controversies regarding Israel stretch for miles. Israel&#39;s government is the problem- not their people. That is like blaming U.S. citizens for the U.S. government bombing Syria, or Hiroshima, or any other big event in our history. That is not the decision of the common man. It is the government. </p>

<p>The government which has led Israel for decades is pro-zionism. This is a fact: </p>

<p>Anyone can be a zionist- it&#39;s simply a matter of ideology. One needs to look no further than Wikipedia to realize this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism</a></p>

<p>You can raise entire generations of people to believe any nonsensical garbage you please, and then like we&#39;ve seen in pictures in this subreddit recently, you can hand machine guns and rocket launchers to 10 year old girls, build illegal walls, fake anti-missile defense systems etc.</p>

<p>If the people who complacently accept this as their identity and culture aren&#39;t at fault, what purpose do they serve other than as murderers to the IDF? Since...they are forced into that, much like their way of thought as well....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...Yet everybody on Reddit (nearly) will say that, secretly, you hate Jews and use Israel to cover that up.</p>

<p>I am a Sephardic Jew. I am spit on by &quot;real&quot; (Ashkenazi) Jews. This has ONLY happened in Israel; never in the states.</p>

<p>I work with Jewish, Catholic, Hindi, Buddhist, Taoist, and Islamic pilots. We all get along famously and our love of aviation conquers all. We all respect each other and have great friendships. Without fail every Ashkenazi Jew I ask about Israel says something like--&quot;Well, it was a good idea after the war but NOBODY told me or my family that OTHER people were being forced from their homes and killed so that Israel would be a Jewish country. They simply told us that, after WWII, <strong>nobody lived in Palestine anymore</strong>.&quot; He heard this lie in shul, in synagogue, again and again and again.</p>

<p>Well, to them, &quot;nobody&quot; did live there anymore. Just &quot;beasts on two legs&quot; (Menachem Begin). The people that DID buy into the propaganda moved to Israel and now live in a terrorist apartheid state but, as long as you&#39;re Jewish, it&#39;s not bad. You go right through the checkpoints that hold up Arabs for hours, you are smiled at by the IDF guards--the same ones that kick the Arab children as they walk past--maybe knock them in the head with the stock of their M16s if they&#39;re feeling <em>especially</em> exuberant. </p>

<p>EVERY ONE of my Jewish friends abhors Israel&#39;s policies--they utterly hate them--yet what do they do? If they speak up they&#39;re a &quot;self-hating Jew&quot; and they&#39;ll lose their job and worse. If they don&#39;t they feel that they are party to murder.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just make this clear--ISRAEL DOES NOT SPEAK FOR ANYTHING NEAR <em>ALL JEWS.</em> Some Jews are Zionists and Israel and its terror is just fine with them. But MOST Jews in America are NOT ARDENT ZIONISTS.</p>

<p>So lighten up--we&#39;ve no plot to take over. Sure, our (ALL of our) masters almost certainly do--but us ordinary Jewish guys just work all day to pay the credit card bills, our car loans, our mortgage, and for clothes for our kids. We hate this Zionist crap. It makes US and our families look bad. Sure, Israel does horrible things--including running a spy ring to spy on the USA that would have been the USSR&#39;s wet dream in 1988. But <em>we have nothing to do with this bullshit</em>. Sadly, other Jews (I&#39;m looking at YOU Sergey Brin and Mark Fuckerberg) fall right into the stereotype--while stealing YOUR entire life.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s simply divide and conquer--oldest trick in the book--and my kids know this too. DON&#39;T fall for it. It&#39;s billshit--and <em>exactly</em> what the socialist Obama government wants.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Pretty sure, yes. I&#39;ve been looking at this issue for years now, and it only fall out one way. Jews have the leadership they have because they want that leadership. Zionism exists because Jews want it to exist. They like Zionism overall, although there are dissenting Jewish voices from Jews who don&#39;t want Israel to exist. It wasn&#39;t an accident that Jews took complete control over our  media. It wasn&#39;t an accident that Jews gained control over Congress. Jews target key power points in Christian society so that they can gain control over non-Jews. It&#39;s a Jewish thing ... but I will qualify it by saying that it is an Ashkenazi Jewish thing, to want to control and  dominate the lives of Christians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought it was &quot;only&quot; 112?</p>

<p>My Jewish grandpa said if best (its an old Yiddish proverb)--&quot;If one person calls you a donkey, forget it. If two people call you a donkey, they&#39;re probably jealous of something. If <em>three</em> people call you a donkey, you&#39;d better start shopping for a saddle.&quot;</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that 120 people have &quot;called the Jewish population donkeys?&quot; Wow.</p>

<p>We can safely say that, most likely, 120 was NOT a mistake. Two or three may have been. But we also don&#39;t know the prevailing attitude of people towards Jews back then. The last expulsion, I&#39;m guessing, was Germany circa 1936?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, hear me out. I want to put into perspective the powers that Jews, as a people, have.</p>

<p>Nearly two-thousand years ago, the Jews were completely bred out of existence by the Phillistines. At that point in time, the Jews literally ceased to be, both as a religion and as a race, because according to God, Judaism was a race first and a religion second and anyone not racially Jewish, was not a Jew religiously, as they could not be.</p>

<p>Despite this, they were somehow able to use what little bloodline they had, to pass down their ultra cryptic religion for so long, that they were able to convince the world that they were still a people in modern times, despite the fact that even their own god disowned them for interbreeding with the Phillistines.</p>

<p>This is a group of people whose ancient ancestors, of whom were <em>actually</em> Jews, were capable of convincing these people to spread their religion down the line, until today, upon which the occupied state of Palestine was created.</p>

<p>What&#39;s depressing, is that multiple genetic tests have shown that the current &quot;Jews&quot; in Israel, are racially identical to Palestinians. In other words, a group of people that don&#39;t exist, were capable of convincing the world that they did exist, and were able to steal someone else&#39;s land in the process.</p>

<p>The problem is not Israel, it&#39;s not Jews, it&#39;s the people calling themselves &quot;Jews&quot;. It&#39;s the nonexistent, fictitious group of people that have created a monopoly on media and have dipped their tentacles into every major business venture and who are behind all the current problems in the Middle East. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re right, the problem isn&#39;t a race of people called the Jews, who ceased to be two-thousand years ago, the problem is a race of people calling themselves the &quot;Jews&quot;.</p>

Forget the barbarous act of circumcision (especially through use of teeth) or protocols for which the Talmud grants pedophilia...  <strong>Israel was set up as a Jewish state</strong>.  Religious Zionists believe a historically inaccurate notion that the land of Palestine belongs to them.  This kind of mentality breeds tribalism (even among atheist Jews); It&#39;s exclusionary and racist against natives to that region.  I think this explains a lot of the public&#39;s support for settlement expansion and brutalization of the the Palestinians.  So while it is the Israeli government that is guilty of implementing such heinous acts, it&#39;s not like the people are as opposed as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/israelis-cheer-gaza-bombing">they are in support of them</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Israeli government is to blame for the majority of the mess.  While I am ascribing blame, I would be remiss not to bring up America&#39;s funding, fused unshakable bond, and all of our UN vetoes.</p>

<p>There are many peace loving Jewish folks who support NGOs that support non-violence, dismantling settlements, and accountability for humanitarian crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Sephardic Jew I can say that I really liked how this thread worked out, and learned some things too.</p>

<p>It cracks me up that asswipes like the ones over at <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> are trolling this sub and putting threads like this up and are commenting &quot;...what a bunch of assholes--listen to this load of crap...&quot;</p>

<p>There IS a &quot;Jewish Problem&quot; in America and most (if not all) of it is because of complete Jewish control of the Congress through AIPAC, the same (and Obama gets it too) through the ADL, Jewish total control of high finance, Jewish complete control of Hollywood and the media...I&#39;m Jewish and, man, to think that such a small number of the total US population controls SO much of what I see and do...its wrong. NO GROUP should have that &quot;monopoly.&quot; But what to do; tribal allegiance is not illegal and these &quot;dual citizens&quot; are usually loyal to Israel first...and are proud to say that they are! So what to do? Anything???</p>

<p>And to think, in most countries its illegal to even post this! Now <em>that</em> is raw power...should any group have access to this kind of power?</p>

<p>The people here have proven that there can be discourse about Jews and Israel <em>without</em> people playing the anti-semite card. Again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m proud of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s seems to be the Ashkenazi, or European, Jews who have historically been the problem in Europe. Maybe at times the Sephardic Jews got caught up in the surge of anger against the Ashkenazi Jews. I mean, if you look at the Jews living peacefully for centuries in Iran, for example, I don&#39;t think anyone views them as a threat or a problem to anyone else. It&#39;s these psychopathic fucks who came out of Germany and Poland and surrounding countries that have always been the problem. They always want to take over and control non-Jews. They can&#39;t help themselves.</p>
