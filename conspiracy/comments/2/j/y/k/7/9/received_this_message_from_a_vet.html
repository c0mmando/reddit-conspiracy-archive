        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I saw your picture on r/conspiracy and I wanted to let you know that despite what you stated, we know.  We, the American military(as I have observed personally through my last six years and 6 month deployment to Iraq), know where our country is headed and what is in store for us and wanted to tell you that we are livid about our current situation as you are.  We are not happy, we do not support our administration, and many of the officers I have spoken to are one bad order from telling higher HQ to &quot;Go fuck yourself.&quot;  </p>

<p>We know that our government is pushing a globalist agenda but I don&#39;t know a single enlisted member who supports it.  Your attitude seems to be that we are blindly supporting the government and maybe even rooting them on but we are not.  We are waiting for our opportunity to step up and make the changes that need to be made; the right changes a the right time.  </p>

<p>I just wanted to let you know that there are a lot of active duty members that are against what is going on that are pushing for change and have the right minded attitude and the same feelings you share.  The reason we are raising a domestic army(militarization of law enforcement) is because the government knows the military doesn&#39;t support the government.  Based on my experience, military members are the most disgruntled, in the know, and striving for change more than anyone else.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The us military oath of enlistment is as follows: &quot;I solemnly swear that i will protect and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies both foreign and domestic, and that i will follow all orders of the president of the united states and the officers appointed above me&quot;. And if im correct, the UCMJ(Uniform Code of Military Justice) states that all LAWFUL orders must be followed. That is that if an order is given after the proper steps have been taken, so long as it is not in violation of the constitution, it must be followed. If the military were ordered to, say, force citizens to hand over their firearms, then they would be required by law to disobey that order. Ask any soldier, sailor, airman, or marine and he or she will tell you that they defend the constitution, NOT the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ask any soldier, sailor, airman, or marine and he or she will tell you that they defend the constitution, NOT the government. </p>

<p>Not very convincing.   I would expect that the soldier, sailor, airman, or marine will follow orders,  and will not defend the constitution.   Tasks are compartmentalized,  and troops are loyal to the survival of their own units,  just like police are loyal to their own ranks.   </p>

<p>The most extensive military,  the largest prison system,  these are not systems that are going to reduce their budgets or activities.   The troops are pawns.  </p>

<p>This is more typical of what really happens:</p>

<p>In 1992, a Lawyer and a Judge were looking for files on a former prisoner in a police station near Paraguay. Instead, they stumbled upon archives documenting an international conspiracy involving the torture, murder, and imprisonment of 480,000 people, now known as the Archives of Terror.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archives_of_Terror">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archives_of_Terror</a></p>

<p>Its not very comfortable to acknowledge this kind of thing.  Societies make up myths to compensate.</p>

<p>Not sure what you&#39;re saying here, or where the sarcasm begins or ends.</p>

<p>Are you saying their claims only to &quot;profess&quot; loyalty but not really give it is just lip service to non-globalists, because they still execute the orders of the elite?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People in military service are enabling the global elite every single day.   At this point,  functionally,  they are mercenaries.   </p>

<p>So their low opinion of their leaders,  the military ones, the political ones,  the corporate ones,  is like an employee who hates their boss and their company,  but takes the money and does the bidding.   How do you call that loyalty?   How do you respect such a person&#39;s judgement on anything?   Such people are part of the problem.    They are not honest with even themselves unless they just admit they are mercenaries.   People who have no personal values but just go for the money or the supposed excitement of being part of some kind of &quot;adventure&quot;.</p>

<p>The smarter one never joined.   The ones that wise up leave.   And then all of a sudden they have something &quot;smart&quot; to say.   But can&#39;t do anything about it.   And then the &quot;vets&quot; or &quot;actives&quot; that still identify as being &quot;in the know&quot; about how to fix the system,  or what the system should do.   The one&#39;s who still have a sentimental attachment to the uniform.   Those guys were turned into sheep,  and they think like sheep.   Their solutions will be another Hitler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my experience in, I see so many people, mostly younger guys who are gung-ho shoot em up brainwashed, at least to an extent. They fully back the involvement wherever as if we are superheroes. I also have a group of friends in my unit where we can go and have a discussion regarding these things are we are calm and rational. I honestly think it&#39;s more about the person. 1) were they rational and logical before enlisting. 2) how easy is it to influence their thought?</p>
