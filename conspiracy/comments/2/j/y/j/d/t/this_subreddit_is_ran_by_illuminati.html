    <div class="md"><p>dispensing mental health care advice doesn&#39;t make you a doctor. it just makes you an ordinary troll with a slightly more sophisticated vocabulary. its pretty transparent to any 3rd party observers. its disgusting that you would stereotype and/or attack people with mental health issues just to get in a cheap shot on a political opponent. its on par with calling someone &quot;retard&quot;. its childish. grow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Telling someone to &quot;take your medication&quot; is not the same thing as telling them that you care and that you hope they are well and to get help if they need to. A lot of those &quot;meds&quot; are poison, and in particular right now synthetic drugs being given to children cause them real harm and change their bodies and can be very addictive. It is horrific stuff and very real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you completely. Up until the &quot;a lot of these meds are poison&quot;.</p>

<p>Because you likely are neither a chemist, biologist, or even a doctor.</p>

<p>If your medical advice comes from youtube, blog posts, and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, you aren&#39;t getting what you need to be healthy. </p>

<p>The problem is that in order to get proper treatment, you would have to trust someone. Someone who can readily admit that they don&#39;t know everything. This is where <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will pounce, on that sliver of doubt.</p>

<p>Listening to someone who is confident (regardless of facts) is like taking a powerful drug. It&#39;s comforting, reassuring, and extremely addictive, <strong>regardless of whether or not what they are saying is real.</strong></p>

<p>Again, I will reiterate, please keep taking your medication, trust your doctors, and you will be a better person for it. The irony is that I likely care more about you then anyone else here, as I&#39;m not parroting an agenda or pushing a theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You appear to be entirely ignorant of the pharmacological abuse of adolescents in the USA.</p>

<p>My information comes from a couple of primary sources, watching the effect of synthetic drugs on my friend&#39;s children, and also from my friend who is a chemist and designs the compounds used in pharma drugs. And one other souce, too. I had a student who came to school every day and put his head down on his desk and said in great misery &quot;Owe my head hurts&quot; and his mother had green hair and an agenda to fill him with as much prescribed pharma pills as possible because she wanted him declared disabled so she could receive a check $.</p>

<p>You are both massively ignorant and extremely naive. You need to be a case manager for autistic kids who are being fed all these pills. If you already know of thse conditions, you are lying to yourself and everyone else with this simpleton&#39;s propaganda message of &quot;take your medication and be well.&quot;</p>

<p>PS You know that some drugs on market go wrong and kill and / or injure a lot of people, too? I mean really fuck you go look up Bextra and Cipro tendon injury. You need a much wider horizon on this topic. </p>

<p>Re: Cipro! The antibiotic that &quot;makes you well!&quot;:</p>

<p>&quot;In one series of 100 cases of fluoroquinolone-associated tendon disorders, the Achilles tendon was involved in 96 cases, with almost half of these cases having bilateral involvement.[4] Tendon rupture occurred in 31% and tendinitis in 69%.[4,5] The average time between the start of treatment to the onset of symptoms was 13 days, with a range of 1 to 90 days.[4,7] Among the 25 cases of fluoroquinolone-associated Achilles tendon rupture reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by 1994,[16] had associated risk factors such as advanced age, renal failure, or corticosteroid use.[2] <strong>Although tendon rupture in one series occurred within 2 weeks of starting antibiotics in half of the cases, rupture may occur after discontinuing the offending medication.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>PS They spent $10 million on the trade show release of Bextra. I was there. At the time, I sure did not expect what would be the immediate future of this drug after being put into market.</p>
