        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I do realise that most of the news outlets are scrambling to debunk those photos, but what if it makes a few people sit up and take fact of what&#39;s going on?</p>

<p>Every political piece of news I&#39;ve seen on the internet or be it some info on a defense contractor, agricultural giant, oil corporation for example, recently, have been overwhelmed with people discussing how many of these senators or politicians are in their back pockets. How, in reality, big business and government aren&#39;t the separate entities they pretend to be, and the only loser in all of their deals and trade agreements is us. 
Now we have pictures of Captain Warmonger and his U.S backed chums in various situations, talking whatever you talk about in those situations. </p>

<p>When will we reach a saturation point? </p>

<p>I cannot for the life of me wonder how people can sit idly by as their rights are stripped away and  how their country is lead to war for the umpteenth time to fight a new enemy. 
How, in general, we get fucked up the arse by every person who wears a suit and says they have our best interests in mind, when they vote on legislation that only benefits either them or a company that has given them a nice little cash bump. 
It&#39;s all there to read, right in plain sight! </p>

<p>It seems people are running out of things to say to defend their various governments. </p>

<p>Granted, there are still a tonne of people that just simply don&#39;t care, which is sad, and maybe I&#39;m expecting too much when it comes to someone&#39;s ability to think critically, I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>I just really hope something happens to change all this, because as daft as it sounds, I&#39;m embarrassed by our race. 
We are so easily distracted by shiny new celebs, new gossip, football, soap operas etc. that we lose track of what really matters. </p>

<p>I read something a while back, can&#39;t remember the exact quote, but it is very similar to: 
You can talk passionately about things within a limited spectrum, everything outside this spectrum, you&#39;re ridiculed and labelled a nut job. </p>

<p>Sorry for not linking anything, this was more of a vent for me than anything else. I&#39;m on mobile, it&#39;s late and I need to go to bed, so I can get up and do my forty hour a week job to earn money for someone else.</p>

<p>Very good article on the topic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the interview, after stating that he could personally show Obama places on the map to bomb in Syria to kill ISIS, he also stated that, in regards to the death squads, <strong>&quot;I know these people intimately. We talk to them all the time.&quot;</strong></p>
